Stubble burning has stopped but Delhi's air quality index still remains in 'very poor' category,"" Javadekar said. “CPCB's 50 teams inspect Delhi and NCR every day and submit the complaints and observations from those visits to the agencies concerned. Yet, some work is done, some not. Hence, the CPCB has issued a notice to the Delhi government asking it to take necessary and swift action on complaints we are forwarding to it,” he said. “Delhi government and all agencies concerned should swing into action as stubble burning has stopped now,” Javadekar said.

This comes as the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) decided to remove Stage III ('Severe' Air Quality) actions under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) and intensify actions under Stage I and II with immediate effect. ""As per the air quality and weather forecast provided by IMD/IITM, there is a likelihood of AQI to remain in lower end of the Very Poor category in the coming days owing to the favourable meteorological conditions and strong wind speeds,"" CAQM said in a statement. ""Construction and demolition project sites, etc. which have been issued specific closure orders on account of violations/non-compliances of various statutory directions, rules, guidelines, etc. under no circumstances shall resume their operations without any specific order to this effect from the Commission,"" the statement added. Classes up to grade 5 are required to shift to hybrid mode under Stage 3. Parents and students have the option to choose online education wherever available. Under Stage 3, the use of BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel cars (4-wheelers) is restricted in Delhi and nearby NCR districts. Persons with disabilities are exempt. Stage 3 also bans non-essential diesel-operated medium goods vehicles with BS-IV or older standards in Delhi. During winters, the Delhi-NCR region enforces restrictions under GRAP, which categorizes air quality into four stages – Stage 1 (Poor, AQI 201-300), Stage 2 (Very Poor, AQI 301-400), Stage 3 (Severe, AQI 401-450), and Stage 4 (Severe Plus, AQI above 450). Unfavourable meteorological conditions, combined with vehicle emissions, paddy-straw burning, firecrackers, and other local pollution sources, lead to hazardous air quality levels in Delhi-NCR during winters.

Stage 4 curbs include a ban on all construction activities, entry of non-essential polluting trucks into Delhi, and mandatory shifting of school classes, except for classes 10 and 12, to hybrid mode.

The Centre's air quality panel for Delhi-NCR on Monday imposed stringent measures under Stage IV of the air pollution control plan as the region's air quality turned ""severe"" due to unfavourable meteorological conditions. In addition to enhancing checks within the city, Delhi Police held an inter-state coordination meeting with Haryana and UP Police to discuss strategies for managing the flow of vehicles into the city, a police officer said. The vehicles approaching Delhi whose destination is not here, would be diverted via the Eastern/Western Peripheral Expressway in order to reduce congestion in the city, the officer said. ""To further strengthen enforcement, Delhi Police plans to install joint pickets at key border areas. These pickets will monitor and restrict the entry of vehicles not meeting the required norms,"" the officer said. Ten police pickets will be installed at every district. These checkpoints will be responsible for imposing fines on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles for plying in the city, another police officer said. A senior police officer said they have already intensified checking over-aged vehicles. ""In collaboration with the traffic police, we have intensified checking at various locations in Delhi. The traffic police have set up their checkpoints near all the toll plazas, Haryana-Delhi and Uttar Pradesh-Delhi borders,"" said the police officer. He further said the traffic police will check the documents of the vehicles to identify their age if they have the proper PUC certificate. Stage IV curbs under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) for winters also include a ban on the entry of polluting trucks carrying non-essential goods into Delhi and mandatory shifting of school classes, except those for X and XII, to hybrid mode. GRAP Stage IV was invoked in Delhi for the first time this season in November due to consistently high pollution levels in the city and adjoining areas.

The AQI was recorded at 273 early Monday morning, marking an improvement from 302 at 4 PM on Sunday. The AQI with a 24-hour average of 273 is slightly worse than Saturday’s 233 but significantly better than the 'very poor' levels seen on Sunday. Most of the 38 monitoring sites in Delhi are under the AQI ‘poor’ category, with four stations reporting ‘moderate’ levels. The improved air quality is due to westerly disturbances that brought rains to the region. However, this same weather system introduced moisture and lower temperatures, which created conditions for pollutant accumulation, causing a temporary deterioration in air quality over the weekend. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB): The 302 AQI recorded on Sunday marked the first day of ‘very poor’ air quality in December after the city saw ‘moderate’ air quality earlier this month, a level not observed since mid-October. The last ‘very poor’ reading was recorded as 346 on 30 November. Despite the short-term improvements, experts predicted that air quality is likely to deteriorate. The AQI is expected to remain in the ‘poor’ category on Monday, but could move back into the ‘very poor’ levels by Tuesday, according to the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi. Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 23.7°C on Sunday, a degree below normal, while the minimum temperature stood at 7.4°C, two degrees below normal.

The downpour, which began in the afternoon and continued into the evening, brought a noticeable drop in temperatures, signaling the onset of winter in the national capital. The cold has begun to intensify in Delhi-NCR. Meanwhile, heavy rainfall was reported in several parts of the city this evening. A video of the rainfall has also surfaced, indicating that the coming days will be very cold in Delhi. If you plan to step outside, make sure to wear warm clothes, as the cold can make you ill. The video of the rainfall was taken from Pandora Park in Delhi. The rainfall due to a western disturbance over a central part of Pakistan was seen as ushering in light to medium rainfall all over Delhi-NCR in the coming days. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), this disturbance should continue bringing isolated rain showers in the next two days. Reducer Naresh Kumar from IMD stated that it would become ""cold"" weather extended after December 9 with a cold wave spread over North India extending from Rajasthan to Punjab and Haryana. The latest forecast from the IMD predicted fog and light rain in the national capital over the coming week. Mostly cloudy skies with light rain or drizzle were forecast for December 8. From December 9 to 11, visibility will be troubled with moderate fog and temperatures will range from 6 degrees to 24 degrees Celsius. The weather will get colder, especially in the morning, with visibility reduced from fog. Shallow fog is expected on December 12, then fog will gradually move in over December 13 and 14; temperatures will slightly increase to around 25 degrees. The temperatures are getting cooler and pollution is on the rise, so night shelters have been made available to the citizens by the Delhi government. AIIMS, Lodhi Road, and Nizamuddin Flyover are among the places where shelters have been made. Delhi's air quality deteriorated once again, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) reaching 302, categorised as 'very poor' at 4 pm on Sunday. Despite the improved conditions due to rain, air pollution remains a significant concern.

While hearing a petition for relaxation of measures taken under GRAP-IV, the court asserted that it would only entertain any petition seeking relaxation from it when pollution levels display a consistent downward trend. The GRAP-IV measures include, among other things, bans on construction activities, prohibition of burning coal and biomass, and closure of brick kilns triggered by alarming levels of air pollution in the national capital. Measures against this action address the severest air quality conditions besetting Delhi, a city noted for hazardous pollution levels, especially during the winter months. The court also scheduled a hearing for Thursday, December 5, to address the modification of the applicability of GRAP-IV and to review the status of air quality in the region. The hearing will involve discussions on potential adjustments to the plan and its impact on the public and economy. In the same order, the Supreme Court directed the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to coordinate more effectively in ensuring the implementation of air quality measures across the city. It emphasised the need for better communication between various concerned authorities, including the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), Delhi Police, and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC). The court also noted the concerning findings from the reports of court commissioners, revealing a serious lack of coordination among the authorities involved in enforcing pollution control measures. The Supreme Court highlighted the importance of the CAQM in facilitating coordination among these agencies to ensure timely and effective action. Furthermore, the court directed the Delhi Police to ensure the safety and protection of court commissioners, who play a critical role in monitoring the implementation of air quality measures. The court underscored the need for adequate security for these officials, particularly as they carry out their duties in the face of possible resistance or public unrest. The Supreme Court’s decision underscores the urgency of addressing the ongoing air pollution crisis in Delhi and reinforces the critical need for coordinated, swift action across all levels of government. The ruling also emphasises the role of judicial oversight in ensuring that the measures outlined in GRAP-IV are effectively executed, with a focus on the well-being of Delhi’s residents.

Both upper and lower respiratory infections, as well as worsening cases of bronchial asthma and COPD, have been observed. The spread of respiratory germs is causing more people to get sick and require hospital care. Air pollution damages the main organ of our respiratory system: The Lungs. Air pollution can trigger asthma attacks and make symptoms worse, especially in children. Exposure to pollutants like diesel exhaust and tobacco smoke also raises the risk of lung cancer. When we spoke to Dr Hitesh Billa, Pulmonology Respiratory Medicine Specialist, Apollo Clinic, Manikonda, he said that it not only affects the lungs but also our cardiovascular system, Heart diseases are very common due to air pollution. It increases blood pressure which is a risk factor for heart diseases like: Coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, heart failure, stroke, and sudden cardiac death. Our vulnerable population i.e. children and elderly are more likely to be exposed to diseases caused by air pollution. Children are more at risk due to developing lungs and immune systems. Older adults, especially those with heart or lung conditions, are also more vulnerable. People with Health Conditions such as asthma, COPD, or heart disease may have worse symptoms due to air pollution.

Experts explain,"Published : Nov 27, 2024 13:18 IST, Updated : Nov 27, 2024 13:18 IST","You might expect to get great views of the city, and maybe even get a sense of removal from cities like Mumbai, Pune, or Delhi, if you are living above the 16th floor of a high-rise. But with increasing AQI and increased pollution levels in those cities, experts say living at an altitude would not necessarily keep you safe from air pollution. This is what happens when you are residing above the 16th floor of high-rise buildings, especially in areas where the quality of air is low. According to Dr Tamorish Kole, Director – Emergency Medicine, DPU Super Specialty Hospital, Pimpri, Pune, living at a higher altitude does not necessarily remove all the environmental hazards. Ground-level ozone is one of the major pollutants, which may rise and settle at a greater height depending upon the weather conditions, and it can also pose some respiratory irritants to the people living there. This ozone causes early death, damaged lungs, cardiovascular disease, reproductive problems including decreased fertility, and cancer. Also, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and indoor pollutants from building materials or furnishings stay at any level without ventilation. When we spoke to Dr Murarji Ghadge, ENT consultant at Ruby Hall Clinic, he said there is a general conception that the quality of air will be better at greater heights because the air at a high altitude is less dense, but this may not happen often in cities like Mumbai, Pune, and Delhi with high pollution. Long-range pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) reach even higher floors even from a long distance. The pollutant PM2.5 is associated with very serious health conditions such as respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, which can be found in the whole mass of air, even at higher elevations. According to scientists, pollutants including particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, ozone, and volatile organic compounds may be carried by the wind currents through many floors of a building in case there are significant emissions from vehicles and industries. Therefore, you might be staying on the 20th floor and your breathing air is highly polluted. Plumes of Air pollution typically remain at a level close to the ground or are mostly found within urban settings with intensive population growth, and traffic conditions. This could make such buildings face pockets of high-altitude wind-driven plumes when a particular time arrives during the daytime, or particular patterns happen regarding directions of air mass movements in an atmosphere. Central air conditioning systems often installed in high-rise buildings, while helpful during hot seasons may not always filter out harmful pollutants, especially if circulation of air is poor and filtration systems are not the most recent. The rising condition of air pollution demands having advanced air purifiers in apartments. Experts warn of the long-term health risks of staying in cities with a growing AQI: For cities like Delhi where there are weather conditions that usually trap air pollution, residents at higher altitudes may not be protective against hazardous levels of air pollution. In areas near the Aravalli Range in Delhi, or the coastal areas of Mumbai, the dispersion of air pollutants can be quite uneven. On particularly hazy days or during the winter months when smog is prevalent, high-rise buildings may be exposed to elevated levels of air pollution as well. The urban heat island effect implies the phenomenon whereby an area within the city faces higher temperatures as opposed to that which occurs within an area in the nearby countryside. In the case of cities, if they have poor AQI, then the concentration of air pollutants would easily get aggravated since the chemicals would persist suspended in that warmer air close to the ground. High-rise residents are still being exposed since thermal inversions trap cooler air at certain levels, which acts by keeping the pollutants at certain levels close to the surface, too. Living high has its perks. For example, in a high-altitude region, winds can bring cleaner air on those occasions when there is little traffic or when it is a windy day. As pollution continues to grow, this is no longer a reliable factor. Not Fully Protected: Standing on the 16th floor and above does not make for clean air; that could penetrate to that floor level. Ventilation Impact: Advanced air filtration in buildings is needed to offset indoor pollution.
Health Monitoring: Monitoring AQI and personal health status, especially for people with existing respiratory conditions.
Environmental Awareness: As air pollution worsens, the requirements for stricter regulations and urban planning regarding air quality become more relevant. Thus, in Mumbai, Pune, and Delhi, where the AQI goes daily above safety standards, most residents of such tall buildings must take precautions not to fall ill in their respective apartments.

This not only damages the facial skin but also increases hair problems. This leads to many problems ranging from hair fall to dryness. The pollutants present in the poisonous air prove to be the cause of hair fall by damaging the roots. If you are also suffering from hair problems due to air pollution, then know which tips help in controlling this problem (how to protect hair from pollution). According to the National Institute of Health, exposure to particulate matter (PM) causes the amount of protein on the scalp to decrease. This affects hair growth and leads to hair fall. Actually, many elements including beta-catenin and cyclin D are present in the proteins available to the hair. 1. Avoid using sticky styling products One should avoid styling hair with products like sticky hair serums, sprays and oils. Actually, the toxins present in the environment and air pollution start sticking to the hair, which increases oxidative stress. This leads to hair loss. In such a situation, one should choose those hair styling products which can seal the cuticles of the hair. 2. Wrap your hair Due to poor air quality, pollutants attack hair rapidly. Apart from this, there is also a risk of hair damage due to sun rays. The effect of pollution and UV rays together prove to be the cause of hair loss and thinning. According to the National Library of Medicine, environmental stress increases protein deficiency in hair. This also causes a change in hair color. Use a cap or head wrap to keep hair safe. 3. Avoid using chemical products While choosing hair care products, make sure that they are completely free from sulfates, parabens and other harmful chemicals. Sulfates and parabens are considered to be one of the major sources of water pollution due to their ability to bioaccumulate in the environment. In fact, these chemicals can also reach the body through hair care products. Therefore, it is important to have sulfate-free or paraben-free labels on them while purchasing hair care products. 4. Use hydrating agents To increase the strength of hair, the use of hydrating agents like aloe vera, hyaluronic acid and glycerin proves beneficial. This reduces the harmful effects of pollution on hair and keeps the hair strong. Also, the texture of the hair remains proper. 5. Hair cleaning is essential With the help of natural hair masks and shampoos, hair can be protected from getting damaged. Washing hair 2 to 3 times a week helps in cleansing and maintains the pH of the scalp. Also, the effect of pollution starts reducing. 6. Keep the body hydrated Due to change in weather, thirst increases, which causes dehydration and increases dryness in hair. In such a situation, consuming plenty of water solves the problem of dehydration in the body. Also, dryness in skin and hair can be reduced. ALSO READ: Dealing with frizzy hair?

What we know so far","Published : Nov 26, 2024 13:53 IST, Updated : Nov 26, 2024 13:53 IST","School reopening news today: After the Supreme Court order, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) asked the state governments in the Delhi-NCR to ensure that classes in educational institutions are held in a “hybrid"" mode. The top court on Monday directed the air quality panel to consider resuming physical classes that were suspended due to high air pollution levels. Classes will be held in the “hybrid"" mode, which means students will attend classes both in “physical"" and also in an “online"", wherever online mode is feasible. However, the anti-pollution panel said the option to exercise an online mode of education, wherever available, will depend with the students and their guardians. As per the government order, the schools will function in hybrid mode for now as long as the air quality is in the severe category and the GRAP IV restrictions are imposed. However, the authorities have not announced when the schools will finally open after the hybrid mode. It is believed that the schools might open fully when the pollution level becomes normal and the air quality improves. Schools for the past two weeks have been suspended in Delhi, Noida, Gurugram and Ghaziabad due to implementation of Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) IV restrictions amid severe air pollution levels. It should be noted that the decision to keep the schools closed until November 25 was taken independently by the respective authorities after Delhi’s AQI remained in the ‘Very Poor’ category. In compliance with the CAQM order, the Directorate of Education, Government of Delhi, has issued instructions to the heads of all government, government-aided, and unaided recognised private schools under its jurisdiction, as well as the NDMC, MCD, and Delhi Cantonment Board regarding conducting classes in hybrid mode for students of all classes with immediate effect until further orders. The national capital on Tuesday woke up to 'very poor' air quality, showing a slight improvement from the past week of 'severe' air quality, as per the Central Pollution Control Board. At 7 am, the Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 382, falling under the 'very poor' category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board. A thick layer of smog covered the National Capital as the Air Quality Index in several areas continues to remain in the 'Very Poor' category.

The Noida traffic police are likely to reduce the speed limit on the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway and Yamuna Expressway from December 15 till February 15 to prevent accidents during dense fog. The speed limit on the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway will be reduced from 100 kilometre per hour (kmph) to 75 kmph for light vehicles, and from 60 kmph to 50 kmph for heavy vehicles. In the similar manner, the speed limit on the Yamuna Expressway will be reduced from 100 kmph to 75 kmph for light vehicles and from 80 kmph to 60 kmph for heavy vehicles. Giving details, Yamuna Prasad, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic), said that in winter, fog reduces visibility on roads, making driving difficult and because of the freezing temperatures, roads also become slippery, increasing the chances of an accident. He added that to avoid any untoward incident, the Noida traffic police are planning to reduce the speed limit on the Noida Expressway and Yamuna Expressway soon.” The development comes after 17 people suffered injuries on November 19 after a speeding Mathura-bound bus rammed into an accidental truck due to dense fog and low visibility on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) around 4.30am. In the same way, a woman died and seven others sustained injuries on Sunday after a speeding truck rammed into their Toyota Camry and Innova Hycross at the 8-kilomtere point on the Yamuna Expressway around 4am. It should be noted that the speed limit reduction on expressways is a standard safety measure implemented annually from December 15 to February 15. This time, the Noida traffic police have held a meeting with Noida authority to implement it in the coming days.

Here's what parents say","Published : Nov 25, 2024 14:27 IST, Updated : Nov 25, 2024 14:27 IST","Delhi school closing news: Even as the air quality in the national capital has improved slightly, schools across the city are closed, and no further notice has been issued regarding their reopening. The closure of the schools, which affects Class X and Class XII, follows a directive from the Delhi government's Directorate of Education. The physical classes were suspended due to severe air pollution and high Air Quality Index (AQI) levels, which posed health risks to students and staff. The Delhi government had earlier allowed physical classes for Class 10th and 12th students, considering the upcoming board exams. However, the decision was reversed after the Supreme Court ruling, and all physical classes were suspended. Apart from Delhi, physical classes up to Class 12 have also been suspended in both urban and rural areas in Gurugram and Faridabad until November 25 due to the high pollution levels in the districts. On November 25, online classes were conducted in all government and private schools of Gurugram district. At this juncture, India TV reached out to some of the parents in the Delhi-NCR to find out their opinion about whether schools should be opened amid air pollution. While some of the parents felt the need for a physical school opening, others strongly objected to it and said health is more important than education and online classes should continue. Anurag Kumar, a parent in the Delhi-NCR, said children should not be sent to school at the moment as the air quality is good for them. He said health is more important than education and health should be given more priority. If children are alive and healthy, then only they can pursue education. He also went on to say that the online classes should continue untill the pollution level normalises in the Delhi-NCR. Underscoring the importance that the physical classes are more beneficial than the online ones, he said physical classes should open only when the AQI is fully normal and conduisive for the children to breathe healthy air. Varun Kumar Sharma, another parent in Noida, said he would prefer not to send his child to school during dangerous levels of AQI. ""However, it seems that the AQI levels are stabilising now. We can send our child to school once the situation improves. We are happy that the Supreme Court has taken note of the alarming situation,"" he added. The statement from the parents came as the air quality in the national capital showed a slight improvement on Monday, moving from the “hazardous” to “unhealthy” category, with an overall air quality index (AQI) of 281, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Early in the morning, there was a thin layer of smog and haze continued to blanket parts of the city. Chandan Kumar Singh, another parent in Delhi said severe air pollution is still there, it is a fact and it has to be accepted. ""There is no other option. There are many problems with online classes. Many times network issues occur. The teacher cannot pay attention to all the children. There is a situation like food supply, so children should go to school. He said if online classes continue for more days, the base of the children will be weak, which will damage their future. ""Therefore, one has to accept the situation as it is and face it. Yes, you have to be careful. Children will have to go to school wearing masks and create a pollution-free environment inside the school,"" he said. It should be noted that the air quality across key locations in Delhi and Noida remained a concern, with varying levels of pollution recorded. ITO reported an AQI of 235, Chandni Chowk 250, Pusa 264, R K Puram 277, and Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium 236, all classified as “poor.” Anand Vihar and Wazirpur recorded significantly higher levels at 333, and Shadipur reported 349, placing these areas in the “very poor” category.

Of course, these things may seem a bit hypothetical to you, but in the coming times, it seems that this will have to be done. The situation is worsening and it is affecting the health of everyone from adults to children. One or two members of every family are suffering from some or the other pollution-related disease. The number of patients has increased by 30% in all the hospitals in Delhi including AIIMS. The biggest problem that doctors are facing is that now even medicines are becoming ineffective. Doctors have to increase the dosage. This is because PM 2.5 particles are reaching different parts of the body through the blood and are spoiling the biomarkers of even healthy people. Especially the problems of diabetes-hypertension and chronic kidney patients have increased a lot. Metal particles like copper, lead, and mercury are entering the body due to poisonous air. This increases the risk of cyst formation in the kidney and these cysts get deposited in the nephron and disturb the kidney function. Then the kidneys stop working. After which dialysis-transplant becomes necessary. Kidney cancer is also increasing due to this reason. While already kidneys have many enemies.

These restrictions, which came into force on Monday morning, include a complete ban on construction and demolition activities, closure of schools, and strict vehicular controls. Among these measures is the enforcement of the odd-even vehicle scheme, as well as a ban on non-emergency commercial vehicles. Humidity levels in the city were also high, recorded at 97% at 8:30 am, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicting moderate fog throughout the day.

On Tuesday, the AQI had improved to 379, and on Friday it was recorded at 373, consistent with Thursday’s levels. Areas across the city continue to report dangerous air quality readings, with some locations like Anand Vihar, Bawana, Jahangirpuri, and Mundka showing AQI values above 400. The AQI readings of several other areas also remain high, including 389 in Alipur, 395 in Ashok Vihar, and 426 in Jahangirpuri. The AQI scale used by authorities categorizes air quality as follows: 0-50 (Good), 51-100 (Satisfactory), 101-200 (Moderate), 201-300 (Poor), 301-400 (Very Poor), 401-450 (Severe), and above 450 (Severe Plus). With the current levels still in the ""very poor"" and ""severe"" range, residents are advised to limit outdoor activities and take necessary precautions to minimize exposure to harmful pollutants.

The annual rankings produced by Resonance Consultancy in partnership with Ipsos are an analysis of large urban regions around the world that are leading in aspects most important to attracting workforce, visitors, and businesses. The 2025 report marks a first in incorporating perception-based data by surveying more than 22,000 people in 31 countries for the first time – the results of which also demonstrate that people all over the world still very much aspire to live, visit, and work in the world’s largest cities. “Mumbai and Delhi are just outside of the top 100; those cities in the Asia Pacific context are in the top but at a global scale don't make the top 100,” Chris Fair, President & CEO of Resonance Consultancy, told PTI in response to a question at the launch of the report in London. “Mumbai and Delhi have some particular strengths, but they have some particular weaknesses from a livability perspective relative to these other cities and from a livability perspective as well. But in our Asia-Pacific report in February, they are in the top 20,” he said. The World's Best Cities ranking is drawn up on “livability”, or the physical sense of a city based on the quality of its natural and built environments; “lovability”, or the quality of life in terms of culture, dining and nightlife; and “prosperity”, or the human capital of a city and the support it receives to thrive. The goal is to create the most comprehensive and holistic approach to measuring and benchmarking both the perception and performance of the cities. “London continues to set the bar for what a truly great city should be,” said Laura Citron, CEO of London & Partners, the UK capital’s growth agency. “Our iconic attractions, world-class financial sector, and fast-growing tech industry are proof of our city’s strength. But it’s the diversity of our people and ideas that drives the innovation, opportunities, and progress that shape our future. No city embodies this quite like London,” she said. Top 10 World’s Best Cities 2025 While the United States is in the lead with 36 cities in the Top 100, Canada comes in a distant second with six cities and Cape Town and Rio de Janeiro make a mark as new entrants to the 2025 ranking. “The phrase ‘perception is reality’ is often used when developing reputation management strategies for companies, but the same holds true for destinations. By merging the top-of-mind destinations where people tell us they want to live, work, and visit with the rigorous evaluation of place that Resonance has been conducting for nearly a decade, we have created a more comprehensive evaluation of cities and can better advise destinations on how to strengthen their reputation,” said Jason McGrath, Executive Vice President at Ipsos. The overall World’s Best Cities rankings are determined by analysing public perception, combined with a wide range of factors that have demonstrated moderate to strong correlations with attracting prime-age population (aged 25-44), visitor expenditure, and/or business formation. The key takeaway from the latest analysis is of the strength and resilience of some of the world’s large cities.

Here's what students must know","Published : Nov 21, 2024 9:22 IST, Updated : Nov 21, 2024 9:22 IST","Because of the deteriorating air quality, schools in many cities including Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurugram were closed and classes are being held online. The Air Quality Index (AQI) deteriorated significantly in these cities, prompting authorities to take this decision. The air pollution levels in Delhi increased so much that restrictions under Grade 4 were imposed with immediate effect on Saturday. Initially, order was issued to close all schools except for Classes 10 and 12. However, after the Supreme Court order, schools for Classes 10 and 12 were also closed in th national capital. Apart from this, JNU, Delhi University also postponed physical classes in view of the poor AQI and has decided to hold online classes until November 23. The DU will now reopen on November 25. Along with Jawaharlal Nehru University, the Jamia Millia Islamia University will also remain closed until November 23. Hence, most schools and colleges in Delhi will remain closed until November 23. Moreover, schools have also been shut in Noida, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Gurugram and Faridabad due to increasing air pollution, with instructions to conduct online classes. After enduring over a week of hazardous air quality, The AQI in Delhi slightly improved conditions on Thursday morning. However, the city's air quality remained dangerously high, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) still at 381, placing it in the ""very poor"" category. Moreover, the Directorate of Education had already issued orders to all District Deputy Commissioners to decide on school closures based on the increasing pollution levels. Then orders were issued to close schools in Gurugram, Faridabad, Noida, Ghaziabad and other places. The Delhi government imposed restrictions under GRAP IV due to the deteriorating pollution levels in the city and its surrounding areas, resulting in classes for schools going online. Notably, the online classes for schools will continue till further notice in Delhi or till the air quality improves in the city. The air quality in the national capital deteriorated back into 'severe' category on Wednesday morning as a thin blanket of smog covered parts of the city, reducing visibility and the quality of air touching a low level of air quality index (AQI). For the past week, the air quality index had been reeling under the 'severe plus' category for the past two consecutive days. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the national capital recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) at 424 as of 9 am today, placing it in the 'severe' category. 13 trains were running late and 9 trains have been rescheduled as a result of the smog, said the Railways.

Despite a marginal improvement, several areas across the national capital continued to record AQI levels exceeding 400, indicating the ongoing severity of the pollution crisis. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), monitoring stations in Jahangirpuri and Wazirpur reported the highest readings at 437 and 419 respectively, followed by Ashok Vihar and Mundka, both recording 416. These figures place much of Delhi and surrounding areas in the ""severe"" air quality range, which has been causing widespread health concerns. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecasted a temperature range for Thursday, with a low of 11°C and a high of 26°C. However, the capital's skies remained heavily smogged, limiting visibility across the city. At Indira Gandhi International Airport, thick smog led to reduced visibility, resulting in significant flight disruptions. As of now, 97 flights have been delayed, and 3 have been cancelled, according to flight tracking data from Flightradar. Airport authorities have advised passengers to check with airlines for updates on flight statuses. The prolonged pollution has also affected nearby regions, including Noida, Ghaziabad, and Gurugram, where residents are facing similar air quality issues. In many parts of the National Capital Region (NCR), a blanket of smog continues to obscure the skyline and affect daily activities. Here are the AQI readings from several locations across Delhi: The ""very poor"" and ""severe"" categories of air quality pose significant health risks, particularly for children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing respiratory or heart conditions. Experts have urged residents to limit outdoor activities, wear N95 masks, and take necessary precautions to avoid exposure to the toxic air. Delhi's air quality has been deteriorating for over a week, with authorities taking multiple steps to mitigate the situation. However, the persistently high levels of pollution are primarily attributed to stubble burning in neighbouring states, vehicular emissions, and industrial activity. The city has also seen limited relief from weather conditions that might help disperse the pollutants. Notably, an AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', 401 and 450 'severe', and above 450 'severe plus'. While air quality has slightly improved compared to previous days, it remains a grave concern for Delhi residents. The city's pollution levels continue to be monitored closely, and authorities are urging immediate action to address the crisis. As the smog continues to engulf the city, experts and environmentalists are calling for more long-term solutions, including stricter enforcement of pollution control measures and a concerted effort to reduce emissions from various sources.

More so for those suffering from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or COPD. This is a progressive lung disease making it hard to breathe. In light of World COPD Day 2024, it is imperative to understand the risks and steps in protecting our lungs. Here are five tips to keep your lungs safe amid the rising air pollution. Air pollution is a major risk to our health, especially to people with respiratory conditions like COPD. Pollutants irritate airways, causing irritation and inflammation, resulting in shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing. The first action towards protecting your lungs from air pollution involves staying informed about the air quality in your area. With the advancement of technology, a good number of apps and websites have emerged that provide real-time air quality data. Most attention is given to outdoor air pollution, but indoor pollutants can also have a lot to play with our health. Common indoor pollutants include secondhand smoke, household chemicals, and mould. They can be very damaging especially to COPD patients as they are always indoors and spend most of their time. Improve the quality of indoor air by ensuring proper ventilation and do not engage with toxic chemicals in your house. It is also advisable that people should avoid smoking and make sure your house is a non-smoking zone. When venturing outdoors, especially where environmental conditions are poor with a lot of air pollution, wearing a mask can protect your lungs even further. It is essential to choose a mask that fits securely and comfortably, as a poorly fitting mask can do more harm than good. Additionally, avoiding outdoor activities during peak traffic hours can also help reduce exposure to air pollution. Though one must always be cautious of air pollution, good health in all aspects remains a good and necessary balance. An appropriate diet, exercise, and hydration are a good way to build the strength of the immune system so that the damage caused by the polluted air to the lungs is decreased to a great extent.

The move aims to curb air pollution and improve air quality in compliance with guidelines from the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM). Deputy Commissioner Ajay Kumar announced that all private sector entities should allow employees to work from home starting November 20, 2024, until further notice. This step is part of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to mitigate the region’s alarming air quality levels and ensure its effective implementation. Gurugram’s AQI reached 404 on Tuesday, placing it within the ‘severe’ category, even as pollutant levels throughout Delhi-NCR soared to extremely hazardous levels. Delhi’s air satisfaction breached the ‘severe plus’ mark for the second consecutive day, prompting pressing intervention under Stage 4 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has urged private firms to allow personnel to work from home or operate at 50% strength to lessen vehicular emissions and improve air quality. In response to the Supreme Court’s directive, schools in Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, and Faridabad have moved classes online. While Noida and Gurugram have suspended physical classes till November 23, Delhi and Faridabad have not specified an end date for the shift. This follows the Delhi government’s earlier closure of colleges for students up to classes 9 and 11. The Supreme Court directed NCR states to take into account transferring all classes online amid alarming pollution levels. This marks some other urgent step to shield public health as the government combats the deteriorating air quality in the region.

According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the city's overall Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at a hazardous 409 at 8 AM, signalling grave health concerns. The Air Quality Index is divided into six categories, with readings between 401 and 450 labelled 'severe,' posing serious health risks. Prolonged exposure to such polluted air can lead to respiratory problems, particularly for children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions. Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) revealed that AQI levels in several parts of Delhi breached the severe threshold, with Mundka and Bawana recording alarming levels of 463 and 471, respectively. Other major hotspots included: Nearby cities such as Noida and Gurugram fared slightly better, with AQI levels of 304 and 287, respectively, but still within unhealthy ranges. The deteriorating air quality has been attributed to vehicular emissions, industrial pollutants, and stagnant weather conditions, exacerbated by seasonal factors such as crop residue burning in neighbouring states. The heavy smog has also led to reduced visibility, impacting daily life and increasing the risk of accidents. To mitigate the crisis, the Delhi government has ordered a halt to physical classes for students up to grade 5. Under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) Phase III, vehicles found violating restrictions will face penalties of ₹20,000 as per Section 194(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.

The data comes as climate officials and activists alike are growing increasingly frustrated with what they see as the talks’, and the world’s, inability to clamp down on planet-warming fossil fuels and the countries and companies that promote them. Seven states or provinces spew more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases, all of them in China, except Texas, which ranks sixth, according to new data from an organization co-founded by former US Vice President Al Gore and released Friday at COP29. Using satellite and ground observations, supplemented by artificial intelligence to fill in gaps, Climate Trace sought to quantify heat-trapping carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, as well as other traditional air pollutants worldwide, including for the first time in more than 9,000 urban areas. Earth's total carbon dioxide and methane pollution grew 0.7% to 61.2 billion metric tons with the short-lived but extra-potent methane rising 0.2%. The figures are higher than other datasets “because we have such comprehensive coverage and we have observed more emissions in more sectors than are typically available,” said Gavin McCormick, Climate Trace’s co-founder. Shanghai’s 256 million metric tons of greenhouse gases led all cities and exceeded those from the nations of Colombia or Norway. Tokyo’s 250 million metric tons would rank in the top 40 of nations if it were a country, while New York City’s 160 million metric tons and Houston’s 150 million metric tons would be in the top 50 of countrywide emissions. Seoul, South Korea, ranks fifth among cities at 142 million metric tons. “One of the sites in the Permian Basin in Texas is by far the No. 1 worst polluting site in the entire world,” Gore said. “And maybe I shouldn’t have been surprised by that, but I think of how dirty some of these sites are in Russia and China and so forth. But Permian Basin is putting them all in the shade.” China, India, Iran, Indonesia and Russia had the biggest increases in emissions from 2022 to 2023, while Venezuela, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States had the biggest decreases in pollution. The dataset — maintained by scientists and analysts from various groups — also looked at traditional pollutants such as carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and other chemicals associated with dirty air. Burning fossil fuels releases both types of pollution, Gore said. This “represents the single biggest health threat facing humanity,” Gore said.

According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the Anand Vihar area recorded an the Air Quality Index (AQI) of 473, categorised as 'severe'. Residents have complained of low visibility on the roads and have also been experiencing irritation in their eyes, running nose, breathlessness and cough.

Mann also took a jibe at Pakistani Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz - daughter of former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, saying nowadays everyone blames us for the pollution. He said Maryam wants to write me a letter. She claimed the polluted smoke went to Lahore from our Punjab, Mann added, saying everyone is blaming us. People in Delhi say pollution comes from Punjab, he said. It seems Punjab's smoke is travelling round and round, he said on a lighter note. ""I want to tell her, do write the letter to me blaming for the graving situation,"" CM Mann said. Without taking the name of former CM Captain Amarinder Singh's Pakistani journalist friend Aroosa Alam, he said earlier a Pakistani woman annoyed us, and now she (Maryam) is attempting to tease us. I say let her also make us unhappy, he added. Stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana is often blamed for the rise in air pollution in Delhi after the paddy harvest in October and November. As the window for the Rabi crop -- wheat -- is very short after paddy harvest, some farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue for sowing of the next crop in Punjab and Haryana in October and November, triggering a blame game for the chocking air pollution in the Delhi-NCR areas. Replying to a question on Punjab being blamed for pollution, Mann said, ""It is also the problem of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.
Its solution has to be found by sitting together."" Interacting with reporters on the sidelines of an event here, the Punjab chief minister laid emphasis on promoting crop diversification in the state in order to encourage farmers to switch over from paddy to other crops. He said it should be ensured that farmers get the same earnings from the alternative crops as they make from paddy. ""We want crop diversification. What we get per acre from the paddy, we should get the same from other crops like maize, bajra and masoor daal.
Paddy is not even a part of our staple diet,"" Mann added.

The Timarpur-Okhla WTE power plant takes in close to 2000 tons of waste every day for energy generation through incineration. However, the plant has been associated with several toxic emissions, raising safety worries for the residents living in the vicinities. Initially, the plant was set up as a component of a larger scheme of the Delhi government dubbed 'Green Revolution' aimed at addressing the problem of growing waste in the capital. However, toxic pollutants such as arsenic, lead and cadmium have been emitted from its operations. These have led to the incidence of illnesses such as respiratory tract infections, skin disorders, and even cancer in the areas surrounding the plant, such as Jasola Vihar, Sukhdev Vihar, and Jamia Nagar. The practices employed by the plant have created several consequences, the most striking one being the disposal of toxic ash. The facility does produce a significant quantity of bottom ash, which is disposed of very close to populated regions without taking any precautionary measures. Interestingly, such ash piles have served as ‘playgrounds’ for children, shocking health officials who say such practices are the reasons why kids are developing more respiratory problems than before. Residents of Jasola, including 78-year-old Dev Kumar Bansal, have claimed that their health has been deteriorating, with almost all of them suffering from continuous bouts of coughs, breathing difficulties, headaches, and weakness. “Everyone in this area is affected,” said Bansal, a Comprehensive resident. “Inevitably benign ailments such as fever take longer durations to heal and most individuals have persistent coughs. More than that, it is even hard to go out for a walk nowadays.” Dr. Shailendra Bhadoria and other physicians in the region have observed a marked rise in the number of patients suffering from asthma and other respiratory diseases. In the words of the practising physician, Dr. Bhadoria, “Health conditions experienced by several residents can be attributed directly to emissions from the plant.” Still, after being schooled for failing to adhere to the pollution control standards before, the plant is undergoing an expansion from 23MW to 40MW to burn more waste. Worrying this has made residents more agitated and they are now approaching the Supreme Court for intervention. On top of the challenges brought about by the WTE plant, air quality in Delhi has deteriorated severely, more so after Diwali. The city AQI levels have often been in the hazardous category, with additions of smog, vehicle pollution, construction site dust and other air contaminants. In the past few days, the AQI reached above 330, exacerbating the risk of respiratory diseases for the people. Environmentalists and health professionals have petitioned the authorities to embrace better mechanisms for waste management such as segregation and recycling of waste rather than unhealthy waste incineration methods. Bhavreen Kandhari, an environmentalist, explained that residents are at risk due to the toxins emitted by the facility, hence calling for policies that would cushion them from these emissions. “The plant is causing irreversible damage to health as well as to the environment. The administration should now prioritise methods and sources of energy other than burning waste,” said Kandhari. Similarly, Atin Biswas from the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) condemned the WTE facility, pointing out that burning of mixed waste creates toxins as a result of incomplete combustion. “Combustion of mixed waste creates contaminants such as C02 and S02, which are harmful to human health,” clarified Atin Biswas. As the pollution levels continue to rise, residents remain trapped in a health crisis. With the WTE plant's expansion plans underway, the pressure is mounting on authorities to find a long-term solution that prioritizes the health and well-being of Delhi’s citizens. Until then, those living near Okhla remain at the mercy of the toxic emissions surrounding them.

The top court asked why restrictions are applied only during specific months in Delhi.  The Supreme Court asked the Delhi government to decide before November 25 on 'perpetual' firecracker ban after consulting stakeholders. The top court also directed the Delhi police commissioner to form special cell to impose firecrackers ban. The court observed that the implementation of firecracker ban was not imposed seriously by Delhi police. During the hearing of the matter, the Supreme Court said prima facie it is of the view that no religion promotes any activity which promotes pollution or compromises with health of people. The court further directed the Delhi Police Commissioner to file a personal affidavit putting on record the steps taken by them to enforce firecrackers ban and asked all NCR states to come up before it and inform about the steps taken by them to ensure pollution is being at minimal. Supreme Court also directed the Delhi Police Commissioner to immediately take action to inform all concerned people about the order of the apex court on the ban of firecrackers and ensure that no license holder sells or manufactures firecrackers.

According to a report by Dawn, senior minister Marriyum Aurangzeb cautioned citizens about smog from India, saying winds would continue to blow towards Lahore for at least one week. She had said Punjab would write to the Foreign Office on Monday (November 4) to take up the issue with New Delhi. However, reacting to the claim, Randhir Jaiswal, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson, said the department has not received any request from the Pakistani side. Pakistan's second-largest city has been facing extreme pollution and the town. The air quality index (AQI) hit more than 1,900 last week. Switzerland-based air quality watchdog IQAir categorised the air quality as ""hazardous"". The provincial minister, during a press conference, said easterly winds from Amritsar and Chandigarh were spiking the air quality index in Lahore to over 1,000 for the past two days. ""The wind from India towards Lahore…is taking the smog to dangerous levels and the wind is likely to sustain its direction for at least next week… People should take care of themselves by avoiding unnecessarily coming out of their houses. The elderly and children should be particularly careful…,"" Dawn quoted the minister as saying during the presser. New Delhi battles intense pollution every winter as cold air traps emissions, dust, and smoke from farm fires in the adjoining farming states of Punjab and Haryana, forcing frequent school closures and construction curbs in response. Air quality in the region is expected to stay 'very poor' until Wednesday, the earth sciences ministry said, and is likely to range from 'very poor' to 'severe' for the subsequent six days. The CPCB says a rating of severe, in the range of 401 and 500 on its index, affects the healthy and can have serious effects on those already suffering diseases. IQAir has rated New Delhi the world's most polluted capital for four years in a row, but poor air quality is a common winter problem across South Asia.

Due to increased pollution, harmful gases like nitrogen and sulfur increase in the air. This causes problems like irritation in the eyes, itching in the eyes, and redness of the eyes. What to do to avoid Pollution? You can adopt some effective home remedies to avoid pollution. First of all, whenever you go out of the house, wear an N-95 mask. Take steam daily. Use an air purifier to purify the air inside the house. Do exercise for some time inside the house. Drink as much water as possible. Eat food rich in Vitamin C. Keep detoxing the body.

During winter, due to many reasons, this air gets polluted, which starts damaging our bodies in different ways. Along with this, the increasing air pollution makes us vulnerable to many diseases and has a deep impact on our physical health as well as mental health. According to the latest data from the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting, an organization of the Government of India that provides information on air quality, the AQI level in Delhi-NCR is increasing day by day. These days the AQI in Delhi NCR has reached 350, which is very harmful to a person's health. The quality of air affects our health including lungs, skin, brain, and eyes. And, if you are suffering from eye problems due to pollution, follow these prevention tips for optical care: Keeping yourself hydrated before or while stepping out in polluted air is essential not just for your eyes but for overall health. Staying hydrated is very important for tear production, as it helps to ensure an adequate amount of tears. This ensures that enough tears are produced to wash away the pollutants that come in contact with your eyes and the irritation caused by them, thereby reducing the risk of irritation, dryness, and redness in the eyes due to air pollution. Wearing UV-protected glasses can also help manage eye problems caused by exposure to poor-quality air. Air pollution often contains dust, eye allergens, and very fine particles that can irritate the eyes. Protective glasses help reduce the irritation and discomfort caused by these irritants, thereby providing relief to the eyes. Lubricating eye drops helps relieve dryness, irritation, and discomfort caused by air pollution. Putting preservative-free eye drops specially designed for dry eyes can provide some relief. After coming in contact with polluted air, you should wash your eyes with water repeatedly, by doing this, if there are any harmful particles in the eyes or eyelids, they will be removed and your eyes will remain healthy. Using an air purifier in your home helps reduce indoor air pollution, creating a cleaner environment that benefits your overall health, including your eye health. ALSO READ: High Uric Acid?

But here comes another city that is six times worse than Delhi. Yes, we are talking about Lahore, one of the cities in Pakistan whose Air Quality Index stood at 1,900 on Sunday, prompting the country to write a letter to the Indian government to open a dialogue on the issue. Notably, the AQI in the city of 14 million people stood at least six times more than the limit defined by the World Health Organisation. The Pakistan government imposed emergency measures like closing schools and issuing work-from-home mandates. It should be noted that the level of deadly PM2.5 pollutants -- fine particulate matter in the air that causes the most damage to health -- peaked at 610 -- more than 40 times the limit of 15 in a 24-hour period considered healthy by the WHO. In Lahore, the city residents have been asked to stay indoors, keep doors and windows shut, and avoid unnecessary travel, and the smog counters have been set up at hospitals, Senior Minister of Punjab Marriyum Aurangzeb said. Because of the pollution, the Pakistan government imposed a ban on three-wheelers known as rickshaws and halted construction in certain areas to reduce the pollution levels. The measures were taken to protect children from respiratory-related and other diseases in the city of 14 million people. Toxic gray smog has sickened tens of thousands of people, mainly children and elderly people, since last month when the air quality started worsening in Lahore, the capital of eastern Punjab province bordering India. The government has also banned construction work in certain areas and fined owners of smoke-emitting vehicles. Schools will remain closed for a week because of the pollution, according to a government notification. Lahore was once known as a city of gardens, which were ubiquitous during the Mughal era from the 16th to 19th centuries. But rapid urbanization and surging population growth have left little room for greenery.

The apex court also demanded an response from the Delhi government and police to the ban on firecrackers. A top court bench headed by Justice S Oka stated that the firecracker ban in Delhi was “hardly implemented"" and the effect was well visible since the pollution level was at an all-time high on Diwali. The court also asked the Delhi government to show the implementation of the ban. ""What is the order (on banning of firecrackers) and how is it being implemented? Something has to be worked out,"" the court asked the Delhi government and tasked it with creating a mechanism ""at least for next year"" to ensure Delhi doesn't choke on aerial pollutants in 2025. The top court also slammed the Delhi government over the rise in pollution after Diwali, saying the ban on firecrackers was not implemented in the national capital. ""There are widespread news reports that the ban on firecrackers (in Delhi NCR) was not implemented at all... this was supposed to be an important measure to reduce pollution,"" the top court bench said. The Supreme Court directed the AAP government and Delhi Police Commissioner to file affidavits stating steps taken to implement the ban this year as well as proposed steps to ensure compliance with the ban next year. A thick layer of haze blanketed Delhi with the national capital's AQI plunging to 362 on the next of Diwali as people defied a citywide ban on firecrackers during the celebrations. Delhi also recorded its most polluted Diwali in three years. On Diwali on Thursday, the city's 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 330, compared to 218 in 2023 and 312 in 2022, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. The national capital's AQI was recorded in the 'very poor' category with a reading of 362 at 9 am on Friday. Most monitoring stations in Delhi showed similar pollution levels, with 37 out of 39 reporting air quality in the 'very poor' category. According to the Sameer app that provides hourly updates of the national AQI published by the CPCB, the AQI in Alipur was recorded at 355, Anand Vihar at 396, Ashok Vihar at 389, Aaya Nagar 351, Bawana at 396, Burari at 394 and Mathura Road at 371. At IGI Airport, the AQI was at 371, Dwarka at 376, Jahangirpuri at 390, Mundka at 375, Patparganj at 365, Rohini at 390, Sonia Vihar at 396, and Wazirpur at 390. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', 401 and 450 'severe' and above 450 'severe plus'. In an effort to combat the spike in pollution during and after Diwali, the Delhi government had enforced a comprehensive ban on firecrackers for the fifth consecutive year, prohibiting their manufacture, storage, sale and use. The city government had also set up 377 enforcement teams and spread awareness through local associations to ensure compliance with the ban. Police teams were deployed to monitor neighbourhoods, with officials warning that legal action would be taken against violators.

Switzerland-based air quality watchdog IQAir categorised the air quality as ""hazardous"". Now, the top minister of Pakistan has started blaming India for the sudden jump in pollution levels. According to a report by Dawn, senior minister Marriyum Aurangzeb cautioned citizens about smog from India, saying winds would continue to blow towards Lahore for at least one week. The provincial minister, during a press conference, said easterly winds from Amritsar and Chandigarh were spiking the air quality index in Lahore to over 1,000 for the past two days. Aurangzeb, who holds the environment portfolio in the cabinet, said Punjab would write to the Foreign Office on Monday (November 4) to take up the issue with New Delhi. ""The wind from India towards Lahore…is taking the smog to dangerous levels and the wind is likely to sustain its direction for at least next week… People should take care of themselves by avoiding unnecessarily coming out of their houses. The elderly and children should be particularly careful…,"" Dawn quoted the minister as saying during the presser. Meanwhile, the government of Punjab province, of which Lahore is the capital city, has introduced mandatory mask-wearing and restricted outdoor activities to combat severe smog. The move follows an alarming surge in air pollution, posing serious health risks to vulnerable groups. According to a press release, the Punjab government has imposed a ‘Green Lockdown’ in the most polluted zones including a ban on construction activities, use of commercial generators, and open food outlets using charcoal, coal or wood without the installation of a proper emission control system. New Delhi battles intense pollution every winter as cold air traps emissions, dust, and smoke from farm fires in the adjoining farming states of Punjab and Haryana, forcing frequent school closures and construction curbs in response. Air quality in the region is expected to stay 'very poor' until Wednesday, the earth sciences ministry said, and is likely to range from 'very poor' to 'severe' for the subsequent six days. The CPCB says a rating of severe, in the range of 401 and 500 on its index, affects the healthy and can have serious effects on those already suffering diseases. IQAir has rated New Delhi the world's most polluted capital for four years in a row, but poor air quality is a common winter problem across South Asia.

The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) reported a sharp rise in pollution due to widespread defiance of the ban, stubble burning and bad weather throughout Delhi, AQI levels became alarming in key areas, leading to the threatening health of residents, especially those with respiratory problems. The DPCC has identified areas like Anand Vihar, Wazirpur and Vivek Vihar as hotspots, where AQI levels have reached the “critical” level, well above the safety limit. These excess levels posed serious health risks to the entire population of Delhi, as fine particulate matter concentrations continue to rise. This year’s Diwali increase echoes previous trends despite regulatory efforts. During past Diwalis, Delhi’s AQI ranged from 312 to 414. This year, the AQI rose to 330, a significant increase from 218 in 2022, indicating ongoing challenges in reducing Diwali-related pollution. The Delhi government has tightened the ban on fireworks, with over 377 teams deployed in the city to enforce it. However, widespread violations have been reported, with residents in many areas blatantly ignoring the ban, prompting the authorities to take action under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). Neighbouring NCR cities like Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurugram also experienced air quality deterioration, though less than Delhi. The wild celebrations in Delhi, and trash burning in Punjab and Haryana added to pollution across the region. According to the DPCC, pollution levels tend to rise again in early November, coinciding with an increase in stubble burning. As air quality deteriorates each year at this time, experts and environmental groups are calling for greater awareness and regulation to combat this recurring pollution problem.

Addressing environmental concerns, strict regulations on firecracker usage have been enforced in several states, such as Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, and Tamil Nadu. These regulations aimed at reducing air quality deterioration during this celebratory period. Generally known for its severe air quality every winter, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has imposed a total ban on the manufacturing, storage, sale, and use of firecrackers until January 1, 2025. This includes online sales. However, the city allows only 'green crackers', which are less harmful, during limited hours - from 8 PM to 10 PM on Diwali, with adjusted timings for Gurpurab, Christmas, and New Year’s Eve. green crackers are free from toxic chemicals like barium and lead. State authorities in Bihar have completely banned all types of firecrackers—including green alternatives—in major cities such as Patna, Gaya, Muzaffarpur, and Hajipur. Maharashtra imposed a complete ban on firecrackers and allowed only green crackers that produce around 30% less pollution than traditional ones.

Heart disease is one of these problems, which is troubling many people these days. In recent times, there has been a significant increase in cases of heart attack. A heart attack is a medical emergency, in which a blood clot blocks the blood flow in the heart and there is a lack of oxygen in the heart tissues. Approximately 91% of the world's population lives in areas where the air quality index exceeds WHO recommendations. Air pollution is one of the most significant risk factors for disability, along with high blood pressure, smoking, and high blood sugar levels. It is also a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which accounts for around one in every three deaths globally. Recently, researchers explored the link between PM 2.5 and cardiovascular-related fatalities. They discovered that between 1990 and 2019, the number of premature cardiovascular disease deaths and years of disability due to PM 2.5 increased by 31% globally. Let us know how air pollution causes heart attack and how it can be avoided. The ever-increasing pollution is also affecting our health. In cases of heart failure, air pollution can further reduce the heart's pumping capacity. The biggest concern for triggering these effects is the very small particles of pollution, which are found in the form of haze, smoke, and dust in the clean air. Many people are at risk of heart attack due to air pollution. Among them, elderly people and people with risk factors for heart disease or stroke may be at higher risk. Apart from this, people with heart attack, angina, bypass surgery, angioplasty with or without stent, stroke, blockage in the arteries of the neck or leg, heart failure, diabetes, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are at higher risk. Apart from this, the following people are also at higher risk. (This article is for general information, please consult a doctor before adopting any remedy).

The national capital's air is becoming choking as the winter season approaches. This pollution has gradually become an annual climatic situation during winters as it is driven by a combination of factors, such as low wind speeds, dropping temperatures, high moisture levels and the presence of pollution particles that act as surfaces for condensation. Meanwhile, considering the alarming rise in air pollution, GRAP-II has been enforced in Delhi-NCR. The restrictions under the second stage of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) came into force on October 21 after several areas in the national capital region recorded an AQI of over 300 in the 'very poor' category.

The tenure of their four-month service will start on November 1. The Delhi LG has also asked the government to come up with a detailed proposal for their regularisation. The CDVs were terminated by LG Saxena on the then Delhi Chief Minister, Arvind Kejriwal's proposal in October last year. Since then the CDVs have been looking for their reinstatement as bus marshal. The issue of their reinstatement created a political ruckus in Delhi. LG Saxena's decision as Chairman of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) comes as a massive relief to suffering erstwhile CDVs. According to Delhi LG's direction, the four-month tenure will start on November 1. Saxena has also advised the GNCTD and the Chief Minister to come up with a concrete scheme in the interim, for their future engagement after following due process, so that they are not misled again and face loss of livelihood, in the interim period of four months. The LG also advised that the scheme to be prepared by the Delhi Government for the CDVs’ regular engagement, should entail details of their deployment, budgetary provisions, financial approvals, and creation of posts and take into consideration reservation norms for SC/ST/OBC/EWS, rather than just being another announcement for media consumption. Notably, the directions came after a meeting on pollution was held at the LG office. LG had called the meeting of DDMA in which Delhi CM Atishi and Minister of Environment Gopal Rai were present. Meanwhile, Delhi minister Saurabh Bharadwaj has reacted to the development and said the struggle of bus marshals has fructified now, adding that the fight to get the CDVs reinstated as bus marshals will go on.

Videos circulating on social media show vast sections of the river frothing, resembling clouds over the water, which gradually dissipated later in the day. ""Officials have already begun sprinkling defoamers to tackle the issue and the government is actively taking steps to manage and resolve the situation,"" the party said in a statement. The overall air quality index (AQI) in Delhi today (October 19) is recorded at 274. As winter approaches, Delhiites experienced chilly winds today (October 19) morning, with the city's air quality remaining in the poor category. The weather department has forecast a clear sky on Saturday. Here is the list of area-wise figures within Delhi-NCR: The maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to settle around 35 degrees Celsius and 19 degrees Celsius respectively. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe"". Pollution in Yamuna river is serious concern Bhim Singh Rawat, associate coordinator of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP), told media that normally, the upper segment of the Yamuna experiences significant flood spells, but this year, there was no such spell during the just-concluded southwest monsoon. ""This is unusual as the river generally witnesses at least a couple of low or medium flood spells in this segment every year,"" Rawat said. He highlighted that the pollution in the river is a serious concern affecting human health and wildlife. While the river has some natural cleansing ability, the pollution levels are alarming, Rawat said, adding that the white froth that was seen during monsoon this year becomes more noticeable during festival times. The AAP said government engineers have been assigned to oversee the operations at the Okhla and Agra Canal barrages. ""Monitoring the timings of the barrage gates' opening and providing regular updates to higher authorities,"" it said. The engineers have been tasked with uploading photos of the Yamuna downstream at Kalindi Kunj every two hours to ensure continuous observation, it added. Experts have urged the government to address the pollution levels in the river, especially as major festivals like Chhath Puja are approaching. The pungent foam contains high levels of ammonia and phosphates, posing serious health risks, including respiratory and skin problems, according to environmental experts. This kind of foam formation is common when fats from decaying plants and pollutants mix with the water, but its presence during monsoon is surprising, said another expert, attributing the frothing to the absence of flood spells that typically wash away pollutants.

A civic body official told news agency PTI that the crackdown comes as part of a citywide effort to curb industrial pollution and regulate illegal operations in non-conforming areas. Notably, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) had last month conducted inspections of 520 industrial units located in non-conforming zones -- areas where 70 per cent of the plots are used for industrial purposes allowed under zoning regulations. Of these, 84 units were found to be in violation of the prescribed norms and were subsequently sealed. There are 27 non-conforming or non-planned industrial areas in the national capital. Additionally, electricity was disconnected for seven other units, the official said. The official further added that more action is underway, particularly targeting the Rithala area in north west Delhi, where further violations are expected to be addressed in the coming weeks. Asked about the impact of these factories on the pollution levels in the Yamuna river, an MCD official said, ""All the polluting industries, irrespective of their location, contribute to the pollution of the Yamuna. The MCD is working comprehensively against such industries. Whether they are around Yamuna or not is not of much significance."" Pollution control has been a key promise of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi, which also governs the MCD. The cleaning of the Yamuna, in particular, has been a focus, with the river often highlighted for environmental degradation in the city.

The rules aim to tackle dust pollution from the construction sites, which is a major contributor to the city's declining air quality, Rai said. This comes a day after the Supreme Court rapped the Commission for Air Quality Management over its failure to curb air pollution due to crop residue burning. The top court said efforts are needed to ensure that stubble-burning alternative equipment is used at the grassroots level. It directed the panel to file a better compliance report. Gopal Rai stated that these guidelines will be strictly enforced starting October 7 adding any violations after this date will lead to penalties with the repeat offenders facing a halt in the construction activities. The rules mandate that all construction sites must be covered with tin sheets to prevent dust from spreading into the surroundings. ""People involved in any kind of construction work whether private, government or company-driven must ensure compliance with these rules,"" Rai emphasised during his press conference. Rai stated that all construction areas must be enclosed with tin sheets, vehicles transporting construction materials must have clean tires and materials like sand and gravel must be covered to prevent dust from spilling onto the roads. To control dust, regular water sprinkling at the construction sites is compulsory, he added. Rai further said that workers must be provided with dust masks and health kits at all times. The Delhi government has also deployed 523 teams from 13 departments to monitor compliance. These teams will inspect the construction sites around the clock, ensuring that the new norms are followed to prevent dust pollution, he said. The anti-dust campaign will run from October 7 to November 7 as part of the winter action plan to tackle pollution in the capital, Rai added. In a first for the national capital, Delhi's environment department will deploy one or two drones at each of the 13 major hotspots to monitor pollution levels as part of the newly launched Winter Action Plan. Environment Minister Gopal Rai while unveiling the 2024 Winter Action Plan with 21 key points said that these hotspots have been prioritised for intensified monitoring and intervention.

Interstate buses on non-clean fuels and BS-III diesel vehicles are now banned. Actions in stages II to IV have been implemented on Sunday in advance based on AQI forecasts. Health experts warn that prolonged exposure to such poor air quality can lead to serious health issues, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing respiratory conditions. Symptoms may include difficulty breathing, aggravated asthma, and other cardiovascular problems. In response to the alarming situation, local officials are urging residents to take precautions. Suggestions include wearing masks when outdoors, using air purifiers indoors, and minimizing outdoor activities during peak pollution hours. The government is also under pressure to implement stricter measures to curb pollution. Initiatives may include increased monitoring of industrial emissions, more rigorous enforcement of construction guidelines, and promotion of public transportation to reduce the number of vehicles on the roads. As winter looms, the fight against air pollution in Delhi becomes increasingly urgent. Residents are hoping for a coordinated effort from authorities to improve air quality and safeguard public health in the months to come.

It highlights the city's status as one of the most polluted regions in the northern plains. According to a report by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), 1.8 crore people living in the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, one of the most polluted regions in the northern plains, are on track to lose an average of 11.9 years of life expectancy compared to the World Health Organisation's (WHO) guidelines. Even by India's own national standards, the residents stand to lose 8.5 years of life expectancy if current pollution levels persist. Delhi, the capital and most populous city of India, also holds the dubious distinction of being the most polluted city globally, the report said. However, the report also said if India were to meet its national PM2.5 standards, life expectancy for Delhi's residents could increase by 8.5 years and if it met the WHO standards, nearly 12 years could be added to the life expectancy of Delhi's residents. PM2.5, a fine particulate matter that can penetrate deep into the respiratory system and trigger respiratory problems, is a significant health risk and a major contributing factor to pollution levels. Meanwhile, the maximum temperature in Delhi on Wednesday (August 28) settled at 34 degrees Celsius, which is normal for this time of the year, the weather department said. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the humidity level stood at 85 per cent at 5:30 pm. The Met department has issued a ""yellow"" alert for Delhi for Thursday. A ""yellow"" alert denotes bad weather and the possibility of worsening conditions that could disrupt daily life, according to the IMD's colour-coded warnings. The IMD has predicted a cloudy sky with moderate rain for Thursday, with the maximum and minimum temperatures likely to hover around 34 and 23 degrees Celsius respectively. Between 8:30 am on August 27 and 8.30 am on August 28, Safdarjung, the city's primary weather station, recorded 9.8 mm rainfall while Lodhi Road recorded 9.3 mm, Ridge 14.5, Ayanagar 7.4 mm and Palam recorded 7.7 mm, the IMD said.

A group of researchers, including experts from the International Institute for Population Sciences in Mumbai, analysed PM2.5 pollution levels across more than 700 districts. The data for their study was sourced from the fifth round of the National Family and Health Survey and the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). In households not having a separate kitchen, the study found higher chances of deaths among newborns and adults. Among newborns and children under five, the chances ""appeared to be almost two-fold and more than two-fold higher, respectively, in the districts of India where the PM2.5 concentration is up to the NAAQS level,"" the authors said in the study published in the journal GeoHealth. Analysing the interaction between PM2.5 levels exceeding the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) of 40 micrograms per cubic metre and household air pollution, the team found that it significantly increased mortality rates, with a 19 per cent rise in deaths among newborns, a 17 per cent rise among children, and a 13 per cent rise among adults. ""The results demonstrate that PM2.5 exhibits a stronger association with mortality across various life stages. Notably, when (household air pollution) is considered in conjunction with ambient pollution, this association is further heightened,"" the authors wrote. PM2.5 levels are typically elevated across the Indo-Gangetic Plain, which extends across the northern Indian subcontinent, due to various factors, including agricultural practices such as the burning of crop residues, as well as emissions from industrial centres and manufacturing hubs. The authors noted that the use of clean fuel and separate kitchens in households remains quite low in the middle and lower plains regions, as well as in districts across central India. In forest-rich areas such as Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and other northeastern states, firewood, along with crop residue and animal dung, is readily available as an easily accessible but unclean fuel option. While previous studies have looked at regional data, this study integrated pollution levels recorded in cities with district-level death estimates, according to the team. District-level data on PM2.5 pollutants were sourced from the Greenhouse Gas Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model. Created by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Austria, the model is an online tool designed to evaluate strategies for reducing emissions of various air pollutants and greenhouse gases. The authors added that the findings showed harmful effects of ambient and household air pollution on human health and mortality. The researchers called for raising awareness among people in vulnerable regions, where the use of clean fuel is low and separate kitchens within households are not common, is very crucial for maintaining healthy air indoors. ""Forgetting about WHO air quality guidelines, in India, policymakers should focus on reducing the anthropogenic PM2.5 emission at least to reach the NAAQS, which can substantially reduce disease burden and, more precisely, premature deaths,"" the authors wrote.

In a written reply, Patel said air pollution is one of the triggering factors for respiratory ailments and associated diseases. Health effects of air pollution are synergistic manifestation of factors which include food habits, occupational habits, socio-economic status, medical history, immunity, heredity etc. of the individuals. The Government of India has taken several steps to address air pollution issues, the Union Minister asserted. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) aims to safeguard the health of women and children by providing them with clean LPG, Patel said. Swachh Hawa (clean air) is an integral component of Swachh Bharat, she added. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change launched the National Clean Air programme in 2019 as a national level strategy to reduce air pollution levels across the country, Patel said. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) launched the National Programme on Climate Change and Human Health (NPCCHH) at the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), with the objective to create awareness, capacity building, health sector preparedness and response-and partnerships-related activities on the climate sensitive health issues in the country since 2019, she added. Now the programme has expanded in all the states and Union Territories and activities are conducted in the form of training on climate sensitive diseases, surveillance on acute respiratory illnesses and heat related illnesses, generation and dissemination of information, education and communication (IEC) on air pollution and heat and its health impacts on health, including children's health. Further, guidelines on 'Air Pollution and its Impact on Children's Health' have been developed in both Hindi and English under the National Programme on Climate Change and Human Health in 2020 and shared with states for implementation, she stated. Several workshops and trainings have been conducted for community-level health workers on air pollution and its impact on children's health, Patel said.

Delhi has the highest proportion of daily and annual deaths linked to PM2.5 air pollution, which consists of particles 2.5 micrometres or smaller in diameter. The primary sources of this pollution are emissions from vehicles and industries. An international research team, including scientists from Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi and the Centre for Chronic Disease Control in New Delhi, found that daily exposure to PM2.5 pollution in Indian cities is associated with an increased risk of death. They suggest that locally generated pollution might be a contributing factor to these fatalities. They found that an increase of 10 micrograms per cubic metre in the average of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution measured over two days (short-term exposure) was related to 1.4 per cent higher daily mortality. The researchers found that the death risk doubled, reaching 2.7%, for every 10 microgram per cubic metre increase in PM2.5 levels. This analysis was restricted to observations that met Indian air quality standards, which are less stringent than the WHO guidelines. The WHO recommends a safe exposure limit of 15 micrograms per cubic metre of PM2.5 over a 24-hour period. Indian air quality standards set a limit of 60 micrograms per cubic meter of PM2.5 over a 24-hour period. The study revealed that in Delhi, there was a 0.31% increase in daily mortality for every 10 micrograms per cubic meter rise in PM2.5. In contrast, Bengaluru experienced a 3.06% increase. The researchers discovered stronger correlations between daily PM2.5 exposure and locally produced pollutants using models designed to investigate cause-and-effect relationships. Therefore, it was possible that the locally generated pollutants were causing these excess deaths, the authors said. ""The causal effects were especially strong in cities with lower concentrations of air pollution, such as (Bengaluru), Chennai, and Shimla,"" the authors wrote. The study, ""the first multi-city, time series analysis of short-term exposure to PM2.5 and daily mortality in India,"" looked at roughly 36 lakh daily deaths across ten Indian cities between 2008 and 2019. Other cities included in the analysis were Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Pune, Shimla and Varanasi.

The study analyzed eight papers published from 2000 to 2023 that examined how air pollution directly affects cardiovascular conditions like heart attacks and strokes, alongside cancer. The review encompassed over 11 million participants. The researchers discovered that exposure to fine particulate (PM2.5) pollution compromised the body's ability to detoxify and defend against inflammation, factors that increase the risk of both cancer and cardiovascular disease. ""Air pollution plays an undeniable role in the field of cardio-oncology,"" the authors, including those from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, wrote. Researchers have discovered that brief exposure to high levels of air pollution can rapidly impact the heart health of cancer patients, as reported in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC): CardioOncology. ""This suggests that even temporary deteriorations in air quality can have immediate adverse effects on vulnerable populations such as cardio-oncology patients,"" said senior author Xiaoquan Rao, a cardiologist at Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Researchers stated that air pollution exacerbates health disparities globally, with marginalized communities experiencing elevated exposure levels. Furthermore, individuals within these groups who have cancer face increased risks of heart disease and mortality compared to the broader population. According to the authors, while air pollution is recognised as a significant risk factor for both heart disease and cancer, this study aims to show its effects in cardio-oncology or the overlap of both conditions - an area in which little research has been done. Deaths due to air pollution are estimated to be about 100-fold higher in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), compared to high-income ones. LMICs also see more than 65 per cent of all cancer deaths and 70 per cent of cardiovascular disease deaths, the authors said in the study. Environmental factors are critical for understanding cardio-oncology risk and patient management and the findings could help identify people more vulnerable to the risk, said Rao. ""This awareness is crucial for developing tailored air pollution exposure control measures and individualised patient management strategies aimed at mitigating cardiovascular disease risks among cancer patients,"" said Rao. The authors also outlined potential interventions aimed at reducing the adverse effects of air pollution exposure, including recommendations for society and governments.

The study investigated the lasting impacts of exposure to air and noise pollution during different stages of development, including in the womb, early childhood, and adolescence. The impact of three prevalent mental health conditions—anxiety, depression, and psychosis, characterised by detachment from reality and possible hallucinations—was examined. A study, spearheaded by the University of Bristol, UK, revealed that with every 0.72 micrograms per cubic meter rise in PM2.5 air pollutants during pregnancy, the likelihood of psychosis rose by 11per cent and depression by 10 per cent. The likelihood of experiencing psychosis later in life was discovered to rise by 9 per cent when exposed to similar conditions during childhood, according to research published in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Network Open. ""This is a major concern, because air pollution is now such a common exposure, and rates of mental health problems are increasing globally,” the study said. ""Given that pollution is also a preventable exposure, interventions to reduce exposure, such as low emissions zones, could potentially improve mental health,"" said lead author Joanne Newbury from the University of Bristol. Exposure to pollution could be rapidly reduced by making targeted interventions available for vulnerable groups, including pregnant women and children, Newbury said. The study involved examining information from more than 9,000 individuals who are part of the Children of the 90s birth cohort, established in Bristol. This cohort originally comprised over 14,000 expectant mothers recruited in 1991 and 1992, and both the mothers and their children have been continuously monitored since then. The researchers compared the participants' mental health reports when they were 13, 18 and 24 years old against outdoor air and noise pollution in Bristol at those points in time. ""An increase of 0.72 micrograms per cubic centimetre in PM2.5 levels during pregnancy and during childhood were associated with elevated odds for psychotic experiences. Pregnancy PM2.5 exposure was also associated with depression,"" the authors wrote. Further, being exposed to higher noise pollution in childhood and teenage was linked with raising the chances of anxiety by 19 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively. ""Childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood are critical periods for the development of psychiatric disorders: worldwide, nearly two-thirds of those affected become unwell by the age of 25. ""Our findings add to a growing body of evidence - from different populations, locations, and using different study designs - suggesting a detrimental impact of air pollution (and potentially noise pollution) on mental health,"" said Newbury. The findings, by themselves, do not prove cause-and-effect relationships. However, other recent studies have shown that areas with low emissions appear to impact mental health positively, the authors said.

According to research in the medical journal The Lancet, 20% of type 2 diabetes cases are linked to continuous exposure to PM 2.5 pollutants. These pollutants are emitted from burning oil, diesel, biomass, and gasoline. PM 2.5 is referred to as a killer pollutant. It is a major component of air pollution in urban areas. Even brief exposure to PM 2.5 can trigger the autonomic nervous system in individuals for a period of time. This increases the risk of insulin resistance, which also increases the risk of heart disease. Prolonged exposure to PM 2.5 pollutants on a monthly basis leads to an increase in blood sugar levels. Staying in contact with them for a long time (about a year) can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes by up to 20%. Research has shown that there is a stronger correlation between air pollution and diabetes among socio-economic groups of men. Globally, 53.7 million people suffer from Type 2 diabetes, with half of them unaware of their condition. In India, around 77 million adults are affected by Type 2 diabetes, and approximately 25 million are at risk of developing it in the future. According to the Swiss organization IQAir, India was the third worst country in terms of air quality among 134 countries in 2023 with an average annual PM 2.5 concentration of 54.4 micrograms per cubic meter, following Bangladesh (79.9 micrograms per cubic meter) and Pakistan (73.7 micrograms per cubic meter).

Explain doctors,"Published : Apr 25, 2024 9:56 IST, Updated : Apr 25, 2024 9:56 IST","The worsening level of pollution hurts people's health. Due to air pollution, people are becoming victims of many diseases. According to doctors, due to poisonous air, people become victims of respiratory diseases like asthma, and bronchitis, many people have also started complaining of watery eyes and itching in the throat. You will be surprised to know this but children are being affected the most by pollution. Due to pollution, the brain development of children is affected. Recently, a study by Spain's Barcelona Institute for Global Health has shockingly revealed that air pollution has more impact on the brains of children aged 4 to 8 years. Let us know in detail about what has been said in the study. According to researchers at Spain's Barcelona Institute for Global Health, air pollution has a greater impact on the brains of children aged 4 to 8 years. This problem is seen more in boys than girls. In areas where AQI goes beyond 500, pollution can also affect the minds of children. In this study, it has been said that exposure to pollution has a more negative impact on the brain of boys. The brain of boys develops more slowly than that of girls. In such a situation, the brain of boys starts becoming weak due to nitrogen dioxide released from air pollution and it starts swelling. Because of this, the concentration of children has decreased. Polluted particles also cause harm to many other parts of the body through the lungs. Smoke from vehicles, fuel, coal, fuel-fired electrical appliances, pesticides, traffic, factories, smoke from chemical production, and sulfur dioxide are the main causes of air pollution.

A new study suggests a connection between air pollution and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a condition where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. The research, published in the International Neurotoxicology Association journal, looked at data from twelve different studies to understand the link. While the evidence isn't conclusive yet, the researchers found a reason to believe that air pollutants, particularly nitrogen dioxide (NO2), might be contributing to a higher risk and severity of OSA. NO2 is a common gas pollutant produced by traffic fumes and the burning of fossil fuels. The study suggests that exposure to NO2 could worsen existing sleep apnea or even increase the chances of developing it altogether. The researchers haven't pinpointed the exact mechanism behind this link, but they propose a few possibilities. Air pollution can irritate and inflame the upper airway, making it more likely to collapse during sleep, a hallmark of OSA. Additionally, pollutants might disrupt the nervous system's control of breathing. ""These pathophysiological changes are known to contribute to the development and exacerbation of respiratory disorders. In the context of OSA, air pollution may aggravate upper airway inflammation and dysfunction, thereby increasing the propensity for airway collapse during sleep,"" the study reads. ""It is important to note that effects of air pollutants may vary based on the type of pollutant, duration of exposure, and individual susceptibility factors, including age, gender, and underlying health conditions,"" it adds. This study adds to a growing body of research suggesting that air pollution can have a wider impact on our health than previously thought. More work is needed to confirm the link between pollution and OSA, but these findings highlight the potential dangers of breathing dirty air.

The increase in ozone concentration is the result of interaction between volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) that are causing significant health risks to the residents of the region. Ozone is one of the highly reactive gases which is generated through sunlight’s induced reactions of NOX and VOCs. It has serious health consequences and as per the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) research, individuals with asthma, respiratory ailments, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and vulnerable demographics like children and older adults have been facing heightened risks. Ground-level ozone could inflame airways, inflict respiratory conditions and increase the frequency of asthma attacks in humans, leading to an increase in hospitalization rates. Several prominent Delhi locations have been recording the rise of ozone levels as per the national ambient air quality standards. Peak concentrations were observed during the daytime, between 11 am to 6 pm. Areas majorly impacted include: Sunil Dahiya, South Asia analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, has attributed the surge in ozone levels to the highlighting factors: He further emphasized addressing sources of both - PM2.5 and ozone emissions to mitigate the air quality issues in the region. Anumita Roychowdhury, the executive director for research and advocacy at CSE highlighted the urgent need for policy interventions to check on the ozone-forming emissions. She also highlighted the exacerbation of ozone-related concerns during the summer and emphasized the need of proactive measures which will mitigate health risks to humans, which are associated with ozone exposure. People residing in Delhi could take preventive measures to counter these health threats. Here are some tips: Incorporating things like beets, spinach, moringa leaves, and black sesame seeds may help in Anemia management. Also, one needs to drink water from copper vessels which could help in improving iron levels and alleviate symptoms like hair loss and fatigue. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved yogurt to have the ability to reduce Type 2 diabetes risk. Gurgaon's air quality index (AQI) has been registered with high levels of PM2.5, PM10, and elevated carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations. Experts have attributed the CO surge to waste-burning practices, that are prompting calls for stricter waste management policies from the Central Pollution Control Board (CAQM) and Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB).

Recently, the authority conducted a pilot project in Rohini and Wazirpur which showed a reduction in particulate matter pollution (PM) by 30 to 55 per cent. If implemented, this will probably be the first time the method is used to check air pollution. What is bio enzymes process? According to Podilapu Mounica Kavya from RR Geocycle Private Limited, the firm that conducted the pilot in December, a solution created by dissolving a litre of bio enzymes in water and that water is sprayed in the air using anti-smog guns to reduce particulate matter in the air. ""While the application of bio enzymes for wastewater treatment and reducing contamination at landfill sites is known, this is possibly the first instance of using this method to combat air pollution in India,"" she said. During the pilot, a solution created by dissolving a litre of bio enzymes in 5,000 litres of water was sprayed in Rohini and Wazirpur using anti-smog guns of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi and the Public Works Department in three eight-hour cycles from December 16 to December 24, a report submitted by the firm to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) said. The results revealed a 55 per cent drop in PM2.5 levels and a 32 per cent decrease in PM10 levels on average, it said. However, within three hours of discontinuing spraying of the bio enzymes, PM2. 5 levels rose by 62 per cent and PM10 levels by 51 per cent on average. The continuous spraying of the solution for seven hours showed better results with the PM2.5 and PM10 levels dropping by 60 to 65 per cent. The concentration of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide also decreased notably while ozone levels showed an increase, according to the report. Indonesia has also experimented with bio enzymes to control air pollution in Jakarta and Bali. R R Geocycle Private Limited's Kavya said the cost of bio enzymes is Rs 2,000 per litre and spraying them across Delhi would amount to an expenditure of Rs 40 crore over 45 days. Mukesh Khare, a professor at IIT-Delhi and a researcher on air pollution issues, said that using bio enzymes to reduce air pollution is unheard of. He said that while algae screens (biofilters) are used in the West for localised air purification, this bio enzyme approach is innovative. Khare, however, cautioned about the potential impact of bio enzyme spraying on ecology.
He stressed the need for an academic committee to review it. Vivek Chattopadhyaya, Principal Programme Manager of the Air Pollution Control Cell at the Centre for Science and Environment, suggested testing the bio enzyme-based technology indoors and comparing results to rule out the impact of meteorological conditions and other interventions. He emphasised the necessity of ensuring the safety of bio enzymes with regard to health. The effect on the respiratory system and other organs in animals and humans should be determined and a credible third party should certify the technology before widespread use, he said. Unfavourable meteorological conditions combined with vehicular emission, paddy straw burning, lighting of firecrackers and other local pollution sources contribute to hazardous air quality levels in Delhi-NCR every winter.

Delhi's Pusa recorded at AQI- 398, Noida at 324, Ghaziabad at 363, Gurugram at 238 and Faridabad at 358. People in the region witnessed a thick layer of smog accompanied by a cold wave on Tuesday morning. Meanwhile, a thick blanket of fog covered the national capital with visibility dropping to zero leading to slowing vehicular traffic. The cold wave conditions are prevailing in North India forcing temperatures to dip in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, and Delhi-NCR among other places. The fresh spell of air pollution commenced on Friday after a brief improvement in the AQI for a few days. The pollution level in Delhi deteriorated on the last weekend, pushing the region into the 'severe' category. It seems there are no signs of improvement in pollution levels, as a combination of local emissions, stubble burning, and low temperatures continues to contribute to severe air pollution. A few days ago the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in Delhi had ordered the removal of GRAP Stage-III curbs in Delhi-NCR. The move paved the way for the removal of restrictions on the operation of BS III petrol and BS IV diesel four-wheelers in Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar.

According to the meteorological department, there is a possibility of a change in the weather of Delhi-NCR in the next few days. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has highlighted that Delhi's air quality is currently the most polluted in the country. Delhi ranks first on the global list of the most polluted cities, with three Indian cities—Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai—included in it. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered good, 51 and 100 satisfactory, 101 and 200 moderate, 201 and 300 poor, 301 and 400 very poor, 401 and 450 severe and above 450 severe plus. The increase in AQI levels comes after the Centre on Saturday (November 18) had removed stringent curbs, including a ban on construction work related to linear projects and the entry of polluting trucks, in Delhi following a drop in pollution levels due to favourable wind speed and direction. These measures constitute the final stage -- Stage IV -- of the Centre's air pollution control plan called the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).

However, by being in charge of what you put on your plate, you can mitigate the effects of air pollution to an extent. According to Nupuur Patil, Fitness and Nutritionist Expert, besides minimizing your exposure to outdoor air pollutants, when possible, following an anti-pollution diet can help you live healthily. Start your anti-pollution journey with leafy greens like spinach, kale, and collard greens. Packed with antioxidants and essential nutrients, they act as your body's natural air purifiers. These greens help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation caused by air pollutants. Sweet, juicy, and antioxidant-rich, berries like blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries are your allies in the fight against pollution. Their vibrant colours signal the presence of potent antioxidants, which combat free radicals and keep your system clean. Broccoli, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts are like detox superstars. They are loaded with compounds, such as sulforaphane, that help your liver detoxify harmful pollutants. These veggies will keep your body running like a well-oiled machine. Oranges, lemons, and grapefruits are rich in vitamin C. This vitamin not only boosts your immune system but also helps your body cope with the oxidative stress brought on by polluted air. Enjoy them in your salads, smoothies, or just as a refreshing snack. All that glitters is not gold, but turmeric is. Turmeric, with its potent anti-inflammatory properties, is your secret weapon against inflammation caused by pollution. Incorporate it into your cooking to reduce the risk of respiratory problems and allergies. Ginger is a natural anti-inflammatory and antioxidant powerhouse. It can help reduce the inflammation in your airways caused by air pollutants. Add ginger to your tea and soups for a soothing effect. Green tea is rich in antioxidants, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which can protect your body from the harmful effects of pollution. Sip on a cup of green tea daily to keep your system fortified. Almonds, walnuts, chia seeds, and flaxseeds are rich sources of healthy fats and antioxidants. They provide essential nutrients to help your body cope with the oxidative stress and inflammation caused by air pollution. Omega-3 fatty acids, which are abundant in salmon, mackerel, and sardines, have anti-inflammatory properties. These healthy fats can reduce the risk of respiratory problems and protect your heart from the effects of pollution. Include whole grains in your diet, such as oats, brown rice, and quinoa. They provide fibre and essential nutrients that help your body combat inflammation and boost your overall health. Do not underestimate the power of sipping small amounts of water throughout the day.

In an interview with The Indian Express, Dr Guleria stated, ""We can learn from solutions implemented elsewhere, but we must understand that this is a medical emergency, a silent killer that affects us and future generations' health. That's why we need to act, even if the cost is high."" Addressing indoor air pollution and mitigation strategies, the veteran pulmonologist stressed the need for more data on the effectiveness of air purifiers. He explained that factors like room size and ventilation are crucial to their efficacy. ""Indoor air quality is often linked to outdoor air quality. Even in a closed room, pollution can enter due to factors like dust. When using an air purifier, its effectiveness depends on the room size and the level of ventilation. In many houses in Delhi, rooms are not airtight, and pollution can still enter even if you close the door,"" Dr Guleria emphasized.

Earlier today, the Centre asked authorities to withdraw GRAP Stag-IV guidelines in the national capital amid signs that air quality is improving in the region. The Centre removed stringent curbs, including a ban on construction work related to linear projects and the entry of polluting trucks into Delhi, following an improvement in air quality due to an increase in the wind speed and a change in the wind direction. These measures constitute the final stage, Stage IV, of the Centre's air pollution control plan called the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). The Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas (CAQM), a statutory body responsible for formulating strategies to combat pollution in the region, asked Delhi and NCR states to revoke all emergency measures, under which only CNG, electric and BS VI-compliant vehicles from other states are allowed to enter Delhi, with exemptions granted to those involved in essential services. All medium and heavy goods vehicles not engaged in essential services were also banned in the capital under Stage IV of GRAP, according to the latest CAQM order.

But what if the air we breathe isn't as safe as we assume? Understand how contaminated air enters our bodies. From our first breath to reaching important organs, polluted air is causing more trouble than we realize. Let's understand this silent process, see how it affects our health, and figure out what we can do to keep the air cleaner for everyone. According to Dr Prakash Chandra Shetty, Urologist, at Hiranandani Hospital, Powai, Mumbai, kidneys are not primarily related to processing polluted contaminants in air but the inhalation of these contaminants affects all the organs which impacts the functioning of kidneys also. Contaminated air contains several toxic elements like carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and heavy metals. Through respiratory organs, these pollutants will enter the body affecting the other organs including the kidneys. Ways through which polluted air affects kidneys' health are as follows: Deposition in the Respiratory Tract: Fine particles pass via bronchi and bronchioles and enter into the respiratory system which can damage and inflame respiratory tissues. This can trigger illnesses like bronchitis and exacerbate pre-existing respiratory conditions like asthma. Blood Pressure: High blood pressure is one of the main factors for kidney diseases which is lined with air pollution. This can harm blood vessels in the kidney making it tough to function smoothly. Cardiovascular Effects: Air pollution is known to have an impact on heart and kidney health both. One of the conditions known as Atherosclerosis, or the hardening of the arteries can affect the kidney's blood flow Diabetes Risk: Some air pollutants have been linked to developing a higher chance of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes's tendency to progressively damage the kidney's small blood vessels over time makes it a major reason for chronic kidney disease. Oxidative Stress: This occurs when the body's levels of free radicals and antioxidants, which are triggered by pollution, become unbalanced. Kidney damage can be increased by oxidative stress. It is very important to understand that an individual's general health and sensitivity, in addition to the type and concentration of pollutants, all can affect how specifically air contaminants affect kidney health. Limit Outdoor Exposure During High Pollution Periods: Stay informed about the air quality through weather apps and other new portals and try to avoid outdoor activities during heavy pollution, especially in rush hour or smoggy days. Use Air Purifiers and Indoor Plants: Invest in high-quality air purifiers for your home to filter out pollutants and improve indoor air quality. Put air-purifying indoor plants like snake plants, spider plants, or peace lilies, which can help absorb certain pollutants. Wear Protective Masks in High-Risk Environments: If you stay in an area where air pollution is always high, using a mask that filters particulate matter will be best for extra protection. Masks like N95 block dangerous airborne particles when you are travelling or working outside. Stay Hydrated and Maintain a Healthy Diet: Drink plenty of water in a day which will help to remove all the toxins of the body with the help of kidneys and consume a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals good for the immune system. Promote Sustainable Transportation and Energy Usage: Use public transport or prefer walking or cycling, to contribute to lower air pollution levels. Support and advocate for sustainable energy sources to decrease overall pollution levels, as cleaner air benefits everyone.

According to the data of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) continued to be in the 'Severe' category on Wednesday. Air pollution levels hit the severe category (AQI above 400) at many places within the city, including RK Puram (417), Punjabi Bagh (423), Jahangirpuri (428) and Anand Vihar (430). Delhi recorded its best air quality on Diwali day in eight years on Sunday (November 12), with its 24-hour average AQI settling at 218 at around 4:00 pm. Bursting crackers: However, the bursting of firecrackers till late Sunday night led to a spike in pollution levels amid low temperatures. Despite the Supreme Court's (SC) ban on firecrackers to mitigate pollution, people in several parts of the national capital flouted the ban by bursting fireworks. Know more about AQI levels: An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, 401 and 450 ‘severe’ and above 450 ‘severe plus’. Previous records of air quality during Diwali festival: Delhi recorded an AQI of 312 on Diwali last year (2022), 382 in 2021, 414 in 2020, 337 in 2019, 281 in 2018, 319 in 2017, and 431 in 2016, according to CPCB data.

Particulate matter 2.5 levels rose sharply, breached all limits. The most polluted spots were Anand Vihar with 1,985, followed by Patparganj with 1,856, Jahangirpuri 1,792, Nehru Nagar with 1,784 and Nehru Stadium with 1,423 micrograms per cubic meter particulate matter in air. Overall, Delhi’s AQI jumped up from 218 in ‘poor’ category’ top 403 in ‘severe’ category. Scientists attributed the rise in AQI to emissions from firecrackers, stubble burning in neighboring states and adverse meteorological conditions, resulting in accumulation of pollutants on Monday morning. The Central Pollution Control Board put the AQI in Anand Vihar at 296, in Punjabi Bagh at 290 and at ITO at 263, while it was 362 on Pusa Road and 290 in R K Puram. Delhi Pollution Control Committee said, air pollution level rose by 45 per cent this year compared to last year’s Diwali. Centre for Science and Environment scientists said, by 2 am, AQI entered the 900-1,000 range in some localities. There was mudslinging between AAP and BJP leaders in Delhi, with Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai alleging that firecrackers were burst in “a targeted manner in some places at the behest of local BJP leaders”. He alleged that despite ban, firecrackers were smuggled in from Haryana and UP to Delhi. BJP leader Kapil Mishra described Rai’s allegation as “shameful”. Mishra said, it is foolish to hold firecrackers responsible for air pollution. The interesting point to note is that Punjab government has claimed that air quality improved after Diwali this year. The state government claimed that there was 8 per cent improvement in AQI across the state compared to last year. The ground reality is that Punjab’s air quality deteriorated by 30 per cent compared to pre-Diwali figures. On November 11, AQI in several cities of Punjab was around 100, but after Diwali, AQI was 169 in Patiala, 166 in Ludhiana, 161 in Amritsar and 167 in Sangrur. Clearly, Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann’s government can pat its own back by comparing Diwali figures with those of last two years. AAP leaders are yet to say who is responsible for air pollution in Punjab. It is surprising that the issue of air pollution has become a political issue among parties. Nearly two crore people living in National Capital Region are being forced to inhale lethal air, but the Delhi environment minister, instead of exploring solutions, is blaming BJP leaders for inciting people to burst crackers on Diwali night. At the other end of the spectrum, there are people trying to explain that the ban on firecrackers did not work, neither in Delhi, nor in Mumbai. It was also said that those supporting ban on Diwali firecrackers are anti-Hindu. The reality is, nobody knows the exact and the main reason behind air pollution in Delhi: Whether it is burning of paddy stubble in Punjab? or bursting of firecrackers in Delhi on Diwali night? Nor do people have a definite solution for tackling air pollution. The single night shower accompanied by winds in Delhi last weekend cleared the continuous haze within minutes, but when rainfall and blowing of winds stopped, air pollution was back. It would be better if all stakeholders and political leaders sit together, rack their brains and find a durable solution to air pollution, so that they can be saved from levelling charges and counter-charges next year.

The state government has undertaken awareness campaigns, and giving subsidies to farmers on various farm equipment,"" he said. Poor air quality, especially during winter, in different cities of the state has always remained a matter of concern, he added.

The Supreme Court also observed that schemes like odd-even for vehicles to tackle pollution issues are mere optics and posted the matter for hearing on Friday. The AAP government in Delhi on Monday announced that the odd-even car rationing system will be enforced from November 13 to 20 to combat air pollution in the city which was seven to eight times above the safe level. When the odd-even was implemented in the past, emergency and police vehicles, two-wheelers, cars driven by women and vehicles ferrying school children and VIPs were exempted. The directives have been issued to implement the stringent restrictions mandated under the final stage of the Central government's air pollution control plan for Delhi-NCR called the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). Amid 'Severe' air pollution in the national capital, the Supreme Court asked the Aam Aadmi Party-led Punjab government to stop the stubble burning in the state, further directing it to take steps ""immediately"". The top court observed that there cannot be a political fighting all the time. “We want it (stubble burning) stopped. We don't know how you do it, it’s your job. But it must be stopped. Something has to be done immediately,” Supreme Court told the Punjab government. The top court also directed the Punjab, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan governments to stop stubble burning forthwith. The remarks of the Supreme Court come after several incidents of stubble burning were reported lately, which is one of contributing factors behind air pollution in the national capital. The AAP on Monday had blamed the Haryana government for pollution in Delhi stating that Punjab is 500 km away from the national capital while Haryana is just 100 km distant.

Domestic as well as foreign tourists have expressed dismay over their failure to capture the beautiful monument in their camera clearly. Agra District Magistrate Bhanu Chandra Goswami on Monday (November 6) directed the authorities during a review meeting to take required steps to curb air pollution in the city. He asked the officials to sprinkle water at the construction sites. A local tour guide Shakeel Rafiq said that the tourists are disappointed when they are failing to capture the Taj Mahal in the background in their pictures. ""On Sunday, I was with an elderly couple from Germany. We visited the monument at 8 am, but could not see the Taj properly from a distance. It made them disappointed,"" Rafiq said. Some tourists from Poland also had to face a similar situation as they too could not view the monument in the morning and had to reschedule their visit to the afternoon, he said. Rajeev Saxena, president of the Tourism Guild of Agra, said it is a serious concern for tourists. Four tourists from the US cancelled a tour of other monuments in the city after visiting the Taj Mahal as they could not see it properly, he said. According to Saxena, the construction activities near the Taj has made the things worse in the last three years. Dr Vishwanath Sharma, regional officer at Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board, Agra, said that measures are being taken to control air pollution. “Government agencies have been asked to sprinkle water at construction sites mainly near the Taj Mahal. Besides, waster burning is banned in the city and authorities have been asked to penalise violators. The traffic police have been asked to divert traffic mainly from the spots where traffic jams occur,"" Sharma said. Ranjit Kumar, assistant professor at Dayalbagh Educational Institute and a local environmentalist, said, ""Emissions from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana affect the air quality of Agra during this period. Taj Mahal is situated on the bank of river Yamuna. Yamuna and Ganga basin act as vacuum and pollution gets transported through the basin and the city like Agra situated over the Indo-Gangetic basin becomes polluted."" ""Increase in air pollution and smog over the Agra region may damage the surface of white marbles of the Taj Mahal,"" he added.

In this article, India TV will explain the positive impacts of working from home (WFH) on air quality, particularly in urban and densely populated areas. Reduced Commuting Emissions: When people work from home, there are fewer cars, and bikes on the road, leading to decreased air pollution from vehicle exhaust, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds. This can result in cleaner air and lower levels of smog in urban areas. Lower Traffic Congestion: Less people commuting to work means less traffic congestion, which can lead to smoother traffic flow and reduced idling time for vehicles. This, in turn, reduces fuel consumption and emissions from stationary vehicles. Energy Savings in Office Buildings: Many office buildings and workplaces consume a substantial amount of energy for heating, cooling, and lighting. With fewer employees in these facilities, energy consumption can be significantly reduced, resulting in lower emissions from power generation and heating sources. Promotion of Sustainable Transportation: Working from home can encourage the use of more sustainable transportation options, such as walking or cycling for short errands, which can further reduce emissions and improve air quality. Improved Local Air Quality: Work-from-home arrangements can lead to a decrease in localized air pollution in residential neighborhoods, making the air cleaner and healthier for those who remain at home. Earlier in the day, in view of the rising air pollution in Delhi-NCR, the ‘Odd-Even’ vehicle system will be implemented for a week in the national Capital from November 13 to 20. Yesterday, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) invoked Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in the entire Delhi- NCR with immediate effect, in addition to all actions under Stage I, II and III to prevent further deterioration of air quality. Notably, GRAP is a set of measures drafted by the Centre's CAQM to tackle air pollution. Stage IV is the highest level of pollution alert. The eight-point action plan as per Stage IV of GRAP is applicable with immediate effect in the entire NCR. Under the action plan entry of truck traffic into Delhi is banned. However, trucks carrying essential commodities/ providing essential services and all LNG/ CNG/ electric trucks will be allowed. There will also be a ban on the plying of Delhi - registered diesel-operated Medium Goods Vehicles (MGVs) and Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) in Delhi, except those carrying essential commodities/ providing essential services.

The party also asked the Manohar Lal Khattar government to assess what steps it has taken to curb air pollution in his state. Earlier on Sunday, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said that the stubble burning in Punjab does not have as much impact on Delhi as that of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh as there is “no movement of wind”. “Punjab's stubble smoke does not have as much impact on Delhi as that of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. This is because there is no movement in the wind. Only if the wind blows, the smoke of Punjab will reach Delhi. Right now there is smoke all around Delhi. The smoke of stubble from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh is reaching Delhi,” Rai had said yesterday. Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Priyanka Kakkar held a press conference today and said that the city has witnessed the best air quality in the last eight years and there has been a dip of 50 to 67 per cent in stubble burning since AAP government came to power last year. “This year Delhi has the best air quality in the last eight years. The data tells that there has been a decline of 31 per cent in pollution in Delhi. According to CAQM, there is 50-67 per cent reduction in stubbing burning in Punjab. The stubble burning that is taking place in Punjab is 500 km away from here and the stubble burning in Haryana is 100 km away,” she said. “Since Haryana is the nearest to Delhi, it should be assessed what steps have the Khattar government taken in the last eight years to curb pollution?” Kakkar added. Amid the political blame-game over Delhi’s air pollution, the residents of the city are gasping for breath are Delhi has been waking to toxic air falling under the ‘Severe’ category for the last four days and a think blanket of mist surrounding the capital city. The situation has also raised health concerns for several residing in Delhi-NCR with doctors expressing concerns over the situation and suggesting to put on masks. Meanwhile, stubble burning continued to take place in Punjab. A farmer in Fizorpur said that they are helpless as the government has not been able to successfully tackle the problem and has also failed to provide a solution. “Burning stubble is not my hobby, but I am helpless. The government should find a solution to this. We do not want to burn stubble but we are helpless... The government has not been successful in tackling the issue of stubble burning...Our children and family also stay here, and they are at risk too but we cannot do anything, we are helpless,” the farmer said. According to the experts, air pollution causes massive damage to the brain and heart and have the potential to trigger anxiety, irrespective of the age group if no precaution is taken.

Ministers Gopal Rai, Atishi, Saurabh Bhardwaj and officers from the concerned departments were also present in the meeting. The meeting comes at a time when the National Capital Region (NCR) has been battling ‘severe’ air pollution over the past few days. A thick suffocating blanket of toxic smog continues to cloak Delhi today as the air quality remains in the 'severe' category, as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Pollution levels in Delhi have remained in the ‘severe’ category for the past few days recording an air quality index (AQI) of above 400 range at several locations in the national capital. Stage IV of GRAP was invoked in Delhi-NCR on Sunday in view of the worsening air quality. The AQI in most areas across the city remained in the 'severe' category at 8 am. Most monitoring stations across Delhi recorded an air quality index (AQI) of above 400. AQI was recorded at at 466 in RK Puram, 402 in ITO, 471 in Patparganj and  488 in New Moti Bagh.

The persistent air pollution has forced people to be choked and compelled them to stay indoors. The neighbouring national capital region has witnessed a similar fate which has also continued to see an AQI in the ‘Severe’ category. A thick layer of haze engulfed the capital city as people woke up gasping for breath. Noida also woke up to 'severe' air quality with almost all of its monitoring stations recording over 616 AQI as of 8 am. Gurugram, also in NCR, also recorded 'severe' category air quality with AQI at 516. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. Anything beyond 500 falls under the 'hazardous' category. In view of the increasing air pollution levels in the national capital, the Delhi government) announced that the primary schools will stay closed in the city till November 10. However, for classes 6 to 12, schools have been given an option to conduct online classes. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has made the decision to implement Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across the entire National Capital Region (NCR) with immediate effect. This decision comes in addition to all actions already outlined under Stages I, II, and III of the plan. The primary objective of this move is to prevent any further deterioration of air quality in the NCR, as reported by the news agency ANI. These measures include a ban on construction work related to linear public projects in the region and restrictions on the entry of polluting trucks and commercial four-wheelers into the capital. Normally, Stage IV is activated at least three days before the Air Quality Index surpasses the 450 mark in Delhi. However, this time, the implementation is reactive due to the worsening air quality. Under Stage IV, only CNG, electric, and BS VI-compliant vehicles from other states are allowed to enter Delhi, with exceptions for those engaged in essential services. Medium and heavy goods vehicles not involved in essential services are entirely banned in the capital, as per the latest CAQM order.

Some other metropolitans also have witnessed moderate air quality in the moderate category. According to a top health expert at AIIMS, Delhi, there is scientific evidence to establish a relationship between air pollution and various kinds of cancer. Besides severely affecting the respiratory system, air pollution may also cause coronary artery diseases like heart attack, brain stroke, and arthritis. ""It is important to understand that air pollution affects various systems of the body, apart from causing respiratory diseases. Pollution has direct relations with coronary artery diseases like heart attack, brain stroke, and arthritis. We have scientific evidence that establishes its relationship with different types of cancer,"" Dr Piyush Ranjan (Additional Professor, Department of Medicine, AIIMS), said. According to the expert, the severe amount of air pollution can also have ill effects on the foetus. Senior Lung specialist, Medanta Hospital Dr Arvind Kumar said that people of all age groups are affected by it including those who are unborn and are presently in their mother’s womb. “All age groups are adversely affected by air pollution. You might wonder how an unborn child is affected because that child is not breathing. When the child's mother is breathing, the toxins go to her lungs; through the lungs, they go into the blood; and through the placenta, they reach the child, and the fetus, and cause damage... When the child is born, they start breathing the same air. Our air quality is around 450–500, which is equal to about 25–30 cigarettes in terms of damage to the body... They have all sorts of breathing problems,” the doctor explained. According to the experts, air pollution causes massive damage to the brain and heart and have the potential to trigger anxiety, irrespective of the age group if no precaution is taken.

The persistent air pollution has forced people to be choked and compelled them to stay indoors. The neighbouring national capital region has witnessed similar fate which has also continued to see an AQI in the ‘Severe’ category. Thick layer of haze engulfed the capital city as people woke up gasping for breath. At 8 am this morning, Delhi’s ITO recorded an AQI at 412, IGI T3 at 484, Dwarka Sector 8 at 491, Najafgarh at 480, Nehru Nagar at 485, North Campus at 442, RK Puram at 494 and Shadipur at 492. The air quality in neighbouring Ghaziabad (410), Gurugram (441), Noida (436), Greater Noida (467), and Faridabad (461) also reported hazardous air quality. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe"". The pollution has inflicted upon people health and breathing concerns regarding which the doctors have expressed their apprehension. Speaking on the air pollution, Senior Lung specialist, Medanta Hospital Dr Arvind Kumar said that people of all age groups are affected by it including those who are unborn and are presently in their mother’s womb. “All age groups are adversely affected by air pollution. You might wonder how an unborn child is affected because that child is not breathing.

They have all sorts of breathing problems,” the doctor explained. He said that the chances of asthma increase due to air pollution especially those suffering from obesity. “From head to toe, there's no organ in the body that escapes the ill effects of air pollution. There is now evidence to say that it causes obesity, it causes asthma. When there is obesity and exposure to air pollution both present, the chances of asthma become many times higher, as was shown by us, the Lung Care Foundation. In a study of 1,100 children in Delhi, we found that one out of three children is suffering from asthma, and when obesity was also present, this number went higher,” he said. When asked if the air purifiers can be a solution at home, Dr Arvind said that they are a personal solution to a public problem. “If you are asking whether air purifiers are the solution to air pollution, my answer is a big no. Air pollution is a public issue, and air purifiers are a personal solution... If the outside air's AQI is 500, then no air purifier can bring it to 15 or 20, and even if it does, then its filter will get wasteful soon. And you have to change it within one to two weeks. If you will not change, then its effectiveness will be less,” he said. The air quality in Delhi-NCR dipped significantly due to a surge in stubble burning across neighbouring states Punjab and Haryana, besides which a gradual drop in temperatures, calm winds that trap pollution have also played a contributing factor. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, Delhi’s AQI witnessed a sharp spike by over 200 points between October 27 and November 3, and ended in a descent into the ‘severe plus’ category (above 450) on Friday. The air quality in the national capital remained in the ‘Severe’ category with an overall AQI of 416 on Saturday. Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said that the government is looking to strictly prohibit the construction work while also banning the entry of vehicles into the capital. ""Our focus is to strictly prohibit the construction work and vehicles entering inside Delhi, causing pollution, implement ban on BS3 petrol & BS4 diesel vehicles, control garbage and biomass burning...People should use public transport instead of private vehicles...For the area around NCR, we requested Union Environment Minister yesterday that the rules of GRAP should be implemented strictly. Even, the orders that CAQM is giving, for diesel buses are not being followed. Our effort is to strictly implement these rules within Delhi and within NCR, in collaboration with the Central Government, since BJP is in power in UP and Haryana. We are trying to ensure that they also focus on implementing this..."" he said. He further blamed Haryana and Uttar Pradesh for Delhi's current situation and said that the smoke of stubble burning from these two states is reaching the national capital. He said that smoke from Punjab will reach Delhi ""only if the wind blows"" and asserted that there is no movement of wind presently. ""...Central government figures show that less stubble has been burnt in Punjab this year in comparison to last year. Punjab's stubble smoke does not have as much impact on Delhi as that of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. This is because there is no movement in the wind. Only if the wind blows, the smoke of Punjab will reach Delhi. Right now there is smoke all around Delhi. The smoke of stubble from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh is reaching Delhi,"" he said. Delhi government on Sunday announced that the primary schools will remain closed till November 10 in view of the air pollution.

Keep these 5 measures in mind,"Published : Nov 04, 2023 17:22 IST, Updated : Nov 04, 2023 17:22 IST","If your hair has started falling rapidly, due to the pollution in your city the cause of hair fall, pay attention!  After recent research, scientists have said that air pollution affects not only your lungs but also the health of your hair. People living in areas with high pollution also have more hair fall. Polluted air contains small dust particles and chemical particles, which reach the pores of your hair and affect them. This is the reason why baldness is increasing rapidly these days. Youths aged between 28-35 years are losing hair in the middle part of the head. To avoid these problems, it is very important to protect your hair from pollution. Here are 5 such tips, which will help you in saving your hair from hair pollution. If the pollution level in your city is very high, keep your hair covered while going out. You can use a cap for this. Beautiful hats will make you stylish and also protect you from pollution and sunlight. Particles present in the air are so fine and small that they are not visible to you with the naked eye. So sometimes even though you don't see pollution, your hair can get damaged. If you ride a bike, then wear a helmet as soon as you leave your house. A helmet not only protects you from accidents but also protects your hair from pollution. By wearing a helmet, the pollution emanating from the smoke of vehicles moving on the road and the dust particles present in the air are not able to reach the pores of your hair and are not able to damage them. However, while wearing a helmet, you should keep in mind that the helmet should be of good quality, and can absorb sweat. Otherwise, sweat on the scalp will also speed up your hair fall. Also Read: Air pollution: 7 home remedies to treat sore throat, coughing People often stop shampooing due to fear of hair fall. But this causes more hair fall. Regular cleaning is very important to remove dust particles and pollution from the hair. To prevent hair fall, you must shampoo your hair at least 3 times a week. Apart from this, you should also apply conditioner 1-2 times. It is worth keeping in mind that if your hair falls, you should choose your shampoo properly. You need an anti-hair fall shampoo that is mild. Harsh shampoos with too many chemicals will cause more damage to your hair. Hair also falls because it does not get proper nutrition. Vitamin E, Vitamin C, and protein are required for good hair growth. You will get protein from food items, hence you should include protein-rich things in your diet. Apart from this, to fulfill the deficiency of essential vitamins for hair, you should massage your hair thoroughly twice a week and use any of these oils for massage. Massaging the hair increases blood circulation in the scalp, which keeps the hair healthy. The best time to massage the hair is at night, because after massaging the hair with oil at night, if you leave it on the head for the whole night, the hair will get the nutrients present in the oil.

The air quality in the national capital remained in the ‘Severe’ category with an overall AQI of 416. A thick toxic haze surrounded the city as the residents woke up to yet another filthy air for the fifth day straight. The doctors have expressed their concerns regarding an increase in the respiratory and eye problems among the young and the elderly. The city's minimum temperature settled at 16.6 degrees Celsius, according to officials. The AQI at Shadipur was recorded at 453. It was 448 at Anand Vihar, 435 at Punjabi Bagh, 432 at Okhla and 431 at RK Puram, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The air quality in other parts of the NCR was also similar to Delhi with Ghaziabad recording AQI at 377, Greater Noida at 490, Faridabad at 449 and Gurugram at 392, according to CPCB. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe"". The concentration of PM2.5, fine particulate matter capable of penetrating deep into the respiratory system and triggering health problems, exceeded the government-prescribed safe limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre by seven to eight times at multiple locations throughout Delhi-NCR. It was 80 to 100 times the healthy limit (5 micrograms per cubic metre) set by the WHO. The air quality in Delhi-NCR dipped significantly due to a surge in stubble burning across neighbouring states Punjab and Haryana, besides which a gradual drop in temperatures, calm winds that trap pollution have also played a contributing factor.

The fourth episode of the series, ""The Great Smog"" revolves around the toxic air which descended on London on 5-9 December 1952. The Great Smog of 1952, often referred to as the Big Smoke or The Great Pea Soup, was indeed a tragic and actual occurrence that resulted in the loss of thousands of civilian lives. In the web series, government officials can be seen describing how an anticyclone is pushing air down over the city, trapping air pollution from coal burning. However, Prime Minister Winston Churchill ridiculed their concerns and disregarded technical terms like ""isobars and isohumes,"" much like some leaders in our country downplay environmental issues.  To bring the situation under control, the Delhi government has ordered to shut schools and stop construction activities but hazardous smog continues to choke the national capital region. The Great Smog of London, also called the Great Smog of 1952, was a serious air pollution crisis that struck London, England, in December 1952. Unusually cold weather, combined with a weather pattern called an anticyclone and calm winds, caused pollutants, largely from burning coal, to build up and create a dense layer of smog over the city. This smog lingered from Friday, December 5th, until Tuesday, December 9th, 1952, and dissipated quickly when the weather changed. The smog had a significant impact, drastically reducing visibility and even creeping into indoor spaces, much worse than previous smog episodes known as ""pea-soupers."" The Great Smog tragically claimed the lives of around 4,000 people in just a few days, mainly due to respiratory issues and accidents. Later research in 2004 suggested that the actual number of deaths linked to the event could be as high as 12,000. After the Great Smog of London in 1952, the UK government and local authorities took several important measures to prevent air pollution problems. Here are some of the key things they did: Can Delhi Take Cue From London To Tackle The Health Crisis? The measures taken by London played a big role in improving its air quality and decreasing the occurrence of severe smog events. They also served as an example for other cities and countries looking to tackle air pollution and protect public health. Delhi can certainly look to London's experience in combating air pollution. Some key takeaways that Delhi could consider are - legislation and regulation, urban planning, public awareness, and encouraging the use of cleaner fuels. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Friday said that it was time to revamp both the Air Pollution (Control and Prevention) Act and NAAQS as the National Clean Air Programme was chugging along without having any marked impact. In a post on X, Ramesh, who is a former Union environment and forest minister said, ""The Air Pollution (Control and Prevention) Act came into being in 1981. Thereafter, ambient air quality standards were announced in April 1994 and later revised in October 1998. In November 2009, after a thorough review by IIT Kanpur and other institutions, a more stringent and wide-ranging National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) was put into effect. This covered 12 pollutants considered very detrimental to public health.""

Pollution levels in the national capital are said to be in 'severe' zone for the first time this season, with scientists warning of a further spike over the next two weeks. As per a Friday order, the AAP government said that if any BS-Ill Petrol and BS-IV Diesel LMV (4 Wheeler) is found plying on roads, those will be prosecuted under Section 194(1) of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, which provides a fine of Rs 20,000. At least 18 out of 37 monitoring stations in Delhi recorded Air Quality Index (AQI) in the “severe” category. The areas where AQI breached the 400-mark are - Anand Vihar (450), Bawana (452), Burari Crossing (408), Dwarka Sector 8 (445), Jahangirpuri (433), Mundka (460), NSIT Dwarka (406), Najafgarh (414), Narela (433), Nehru Nagar (400), New Moti Bagh (423), Okhla Phase 2 (415), Patparganj (412), Punjabi Bagh (445), R K Puram (417), Rohini (454), Shadipur (407) and Wazirpur (435). An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”. All government and private primary schools in Delhi will remain closed for the next two days in view of rising pollution levels, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Thursday night. The Centre's pollution control panel has also instructed to halt non-essential construction work, stone crushing and mining in Delhi-NCR as the air quality in the capital entered the 'severe' category.

The demand came amid rising air pollution levels in the national capital and other parts of the country. Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said The Air Pollution (Control and Prevention) Act came into being in 1981. Thereafter, ambient air quality standards were announced in April 1994 and later revised in October 1998, he noted. In November 2009, after a thorough review by IIT Kanpur and other institutions, a more stringent and wide-ranging National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) was put into effect. This covered 12 pollutants considered very detrimental to public health, he said, while sharing the press note that accompanied the implementation of NAAQS which reveals the thinking for the significant shift that took place then. ""It is now time for a revisit and a total revamp of both the Act and the NAAQS. Over the past decade and more, compelling evidence has accumulated on the impacts of air pollution on public health,"" Ramesh said. The former environment minister said in January 2014, an expert steering committee on Air Pollution and Health Related Issues was set up and it submitted its report in August 2015. ""Since then the weaknesses in our enforcement machinery of both the law and the standards along with the emasculation of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) have become painfully evident,"" Ramesh said. ""The National Clean Air Programme is chugging along without having any marked impacts. Air pollution hits the headlines mostly in November when the nation's capital chokes. But it is a daily agony across the country all round the year,"" the Congress leader said. Delhi AQI: Delhi's air quality plummeted to the severe plus category on Friday morning, a stage at which all emergency measures, including a ban on polluting trucks, commercial four-wheelers, and all types of construction, are mandated to be initiated and enforced in the National Capital Region.

The shuttle services will start from Kidwai Nagar and RK Puram for Central Secretariat for Central government employees, Transport Commissioner Ashish Kundra said in a post on X (formerly known as twitter). For Delhi government employees, the e-bus shuttle service will also run from Gulabi Bagh to Delhi Secretariat, Kundra added. Severe air triggers ban on non-essential construction in Delhi-NCR: Delhi-NCR's air quality neared the emergency threshold on Thursday (November 2), prompting an immediate ban on non-essential construction work and the closure of primary schools in the capital, as authorities acted swiftly to address the health-threatening pollution. As a dense and pungent haze blanketed the skyline of Delhi-NCR, the concentration of PM2.5, fine particulate matter that can penetrate deep into the respiratory system and trigger health problems, exceeded the safe limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre by a seven to eightfold at multiple locations throughout the region. According to a numerical model-based system developed by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune, smoke from stubble burning accounted for 25 per cent of the PM2.5 pollution in Delhi on Thursday. It may soar to 35 per cent on Friday. Alarmed by the spike in air pollution levels, the Centre's pollution control panel ordered an immediate ban on non-essential construction work, stone crushing and mining in the region. Restrictions have also been imposed on plying of BS III petrol and BS IV diesel four-wheelers in Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar. Primary schools closed in national capital: Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that all government and private primary schools in the city will remain closed for the next two days in view of rising pollution levels. Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai has called an emergency meeting on Friday to review the situation. The Centre's action comes as part of Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) -- the Centre's air pollution control plan which is implemented in the region during the winter season. GRAP categorises actions into four stages: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), a statutory body responsible for developing strategies to combat pollution in the region, said the pollution levels are only expected to increase further owing to highly unfavourable meteorological and climatic conditions. Neighbouring states suffer poor AQI: The city's AQI plunged to 422 at 10 pm, the worst this season so far. The 24-hour average AQI was 364 on Wednesday, 359 on Tuesday, 347 on Monday, 325 on Sunday, 304 on Saturday, and 261 on Friday. Not just Delhi, several cities in neighbouring Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh also reported hazardous air. These included Hanumangarh (438) and Sri Ganganagar (359) in Rajasthan; Hisar (414), Fatehabad (423), Jind (413), Rohtak (388), Sonepat (374), Kurukshetra (343), Karnal (343), Kaithal (379), Bhiwani (355), Faridabad (368) and Gurugram (297) in Haryana; and Ghaziabad (286), Noida (313) and Greater Noida (402) in Uttar Pradesh. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. Scientists have warned of further deterioration of air quality in Delhi-NCR over the next two weeks. An official from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported that the visibility reduced to just 500 metres at the Safdarjung Observatory at around 7:00 am, gradually improving to 800 metres as temperatures increased during the day. Health issues due to air pollution: Health professionals have expressed concerns that air pollution is increasing asthma and lung problems in children and the elderly. ""We are recording a surge in the number of irritative bronchitis infections. It is recommended that people suffering from respiratory issues such as chronic bronchitis and asthma take their medicines regularly and do not go out in the open unless absolutely necessary,"" said Jugal Kishore, the head of the medicine department at Safdarjung Hospital. Considering the spike in indoor pollution in Delhi, he advised people to use air purifiers in their homes. Air pollution in India resulted in 1.67 million deaths in 2019- the largest pollution-related death toll in any country in the world- and accounted for USD 36.8 billion in economic losses, according to a new study by researchers from the Global Observatory on Pollution and Health at Boston College, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), and the Public Health Foundation of India. Lack of rain post-monsoon: One of the major reasons behind the accumulation of pollutants in recent days is the lack of rainfall during this post-monsoon season so far. According to government data, Delhi's air quality in October 2023 was the worst since 2020, with meteorologists attributing it to the absence of rainfall. The capital recorded an AQI of 210 in October, compared to 210 in October last year and 173 in October 2021, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). In contrast to October 2022 (129 mm) and October 2021 (123 mm), Delhi experienced only one rainy day (5.4 mm of precipitation) in October 2023. Unfavourable meteorological conditions, combined with emissions from firecrackers, paddy straw burning, and local pollution sources, contribute to hazardous air quality levels in Delhi-NCR during winter. Stubble burning: According to an analysis conducted by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), the capital experiences peak pollution from November 1 to November 15 when the number of stubble burning incidents in Punjab and Haryana increase. The CAQM reported that the number of stubble burning incidents in Punjab and Haryana since September 15 has reduced by around 56 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively, compared to the corresponding period last year. However, the agrarian states have seen a significant jump in farm fires over the last three days. The Punjab government aims to reduce farm fires by 50 per cent in this winter season and eliminate stubble burning in six districts. According to Punjab's action plan to curb paddy straw burning, about 31 lakh hectares of land in the state are under paddy cultivation, expected to generate around 16 million tonnes of paddy straw (non-basmati). Haryana estimates that about 14.82 lakh hectares of land in the state are under paddy cultivation, expected to generate over 7.3 million tonnes of paddy straw (non-basmati). The state is making efforts to nearly eliminate farm fires this year. According to a numerical model-based system developed by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) in Pune, vehicular emissions (11 per cent to 16 per cent) and stubble burning (seven per cent to 16 per cent) currently stand as the two major contributors to Delhi's air quality. Delhi Environment Minister Rai announced on Wednesday (November 1) that the city government would ban construction work in areas where the AQI remains above the 400-mark for five consecutive days. The Delhi government launched a 15-point action plan last month to mitigate air pollution during the winter season, with a strong emphasis on addressing dust pollution, vehicular emissions, and open burning of garbage. In line with the practice of the last three years, the Delhi government last month also announced a comprehensive ban on the manufacture, storage, sale, and use of firecrackers within the city. It has launched ""Red Light on Gaadi Off"" campaign to curb vehicular pollution and plans to hire 1,000 private CNG buses to strengthen public transport and reduce vehicular pollution.

The DMRC said the move was taken in view of the measures taken by pollution control authorities on Thursday to encourage more and more people to use public transport in Delhi and neighbouring cities. The air in Delhi grew more poisonous with the Air Quality Index (AQI) standing at 402 at 5 pm, prompting the Centre's pollution control panel imposed Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) that is implemented in the region during the winter season. ""In view of the implementation of GRAP-III stage to combat pollution in Delhi, the DMRC will be further adding 20 extra trips across its network starting tomorrow i. e, 3rd November 2023 (Friday),"" the DMRC said in a statement.

The court asked the department to take steps to ensure that the Air Quality Index (AQI) improves in the national capital. The court was hearing matters related to the creation of an alternative forest in Delhi and filling up vacancies in the forest department Justice Jasmeet Singh observed that children were suffering from asthma due to breathing polluted air. The encroachment was taking place in the ridge area, considered the lungs of the national capital, ""right under the nose"" of government officials, he added. Asking the principal secretary of the forest department to fill the vacancies on a ""war footing"", the court said, ""You are responsible for the quality of the air we breathe. It is your obligation to ensure AQI comes down."" ""Every kid is having breathing problems. (In) December-January, people have to travel out when it is the best time to be here,"" the court lamented. The court emphasised the residents of Delhi have the fundamental right to clean air to breathe and greenery goes a long way in doing that. The senior official informed the court that the department was going to undertake ""eco-restoration"" of 136 acre of ""deemed forest"" land in Isapur near Haryana border. He also said Yamuna floodplains were being ecologically rejuvenated and restored by various authorities. The court was also assured that steps will be taken to complete the recruitment process for various vacant posts in the forest department. HC on alternative forest The court had told the forest department of the Delhi government that ""we don't have the luxury of time"" as the existing forest cover, i.e. the ridge area, ""has its life"" and an alternative ""dedicated forest"" will be ready only in 10-15 years. It had remarked that the proposal put forward by the authorities about setting aside a minuscule 0.23 acre of land to develop an alternative forest was a ""joke"".

Know the impact of air pollution on skin,"Published : Nov 01, 2023 13:33 IST, Updated : Nov 01, 2023 13:33 IST","Air pollution is a growing concern in today's world, with increasing levels of pollutants in the air due to industrialization and urbanization. While we are all aware of the impact of air pollution on our respiratory health, the effects on our skin are often overlooked. The truth is, that exposure to air pollution can have a significant impact on our skin, leading to various skin issues such as hyperpigmentation and melasma. In this article, we will dive deep into understanding the effects of air pollution on our skin and how it can contribute to these common skin problems. Before we understand the relationship between air pollution and these skin issues, let's first understand what hyperpigmentation and melasma are. Hyperpigmentation refers to darkening of certain areas of the skin due to an increase in melanin production. This can be caused by various factors such as sun exposure, hormonal changes, and certain medications. On the other hand, melasma is a type of hyperpigmentation that causes brown or greyish patches on the skin, primarily on the face. It is often triggered by hormonal changes, sun exposure, and genetics. Air pollution contains various harmful particles such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter, which can penetrate deep into our skin and cause damage. These pollutants can disrupt the skin's natural barrier and lead to oxidative stress, inflammation, and premature ageing. Moreover, they can also trigger an increase in melanin production in our skin cells, leading to hyperpigmentation and melasma. As per Dr Ajita Bagai Kakkar, Associate Director - Dermatology, Lasers and Aesthetic Medicines, Max Multi Speciality Centre, Panchsheel Park, smog, smoke, and pollution all can cause damage to the skin just like exposure (photodamage) It is part of extrinsic ageing. This is the time for dry skin, allergic reactions, dermatitis, and sudden eczema flaring up. Patients complain of stinging, parched dry skin, especially on the face and neck, they feel like no moisturizer works for them during this time. As a result, they end up with itching uneven skin tone and sometimes pigmentation. Patients who have atopic dermatitis get flare-ups of their disease. Chelitis, a dry scaly lips condition is another issue associated with dry skin and pollution. It is advisable for those who suffer from dry skin, those who are on multiple medications for cardiac issues and diabetes, those who are on immunosuppressants and geriatric patients to be careful and take extra precautions in moisturizing and using the right ceramide-based moisturizers and gentle cleansers. To avoid outdoor exposure seek the advice of a dermatologist as soon as they notice signs of allergy or dry skin. While we cannot completely avoid exposure to air pollution, there are ways to protect our skin and prevent or treat hyperpigmentation and melasma. Use Sunscreen Daily: Sunscreen is your best defence against hyperpigmentation and melasma. Opt for a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 and reapply every two hours when outdoors. This will not only protect your skin from UV rays but also from pollutants. Cleanse Your Skin Thoroughly: Make sure to cleanse your skin twice a day to remove any pollutants that may have accumulated on the surface. Use a gentle cleanser that does not strip your skin of its natural oils. Add Antioxidants to Your Skincare Routine: Antioxidants such as Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and Green Tea Extract can protect your skin from free radical damage caused by air pollution. Look for skincare products that contain these ingredients. Consider Using a Pollution-Fighting Serum: Pollution-fighting serums are specifically designed to protect the skin from environmental stressors. Look for serums that contain ingredients such as niacinamide, resveratrol, and ferulic acid. Treat Hyperpigmentation with Topical Treatments: There are various topical treatments available to treat hyperpigmentation and melasma, such as retinoids, alpha hydroxy acids, and hydroquinone. Consult a dermatologist to determine the best treatment for your skin type. Protect Your Skin From Indoor Pollutants: While we often think of air pollution as an outdoor problem, indoor pollutants can also harm our skin. Make sure to keep your indoor air clean by using air purifiers and avoiding smoking or burning candles or incense.

The polluted air is not only impacting adult's health but also posing a significant health risk to a child's well-being. Prolonged exposure to air pollution can hinder a child's physical and cognitive development, potentially resulting in learning difficulties and behavioural challenges. As per a WHO report on air pollution and child health, every day around 93% of the world’s children under the age of 15 years (1.8 billion children) breathe air that is so polluted it puts their health and development at serious risk.  The report revealed that when pregnant women are exposed to polluted air, they are more likely to give birth prematurely and have small, low birth-weight children. Air pollution also impacts neurodevelopment and cognitive ability and can trigger asthma, and childhood cancer. Children who have been exposed to high levels of air pollution may be at greater risk for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease later in life. “Polluted air is poisoning millions of children and ruining their lives. This is inexcusable. Every child should be able to breathe clean air so they can grow and fulfil their full potential,” Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General said. Protecting children from air pollution requires multiple actions, including individuals, communities, and government policies. People need to work together to make the air cleaner and healthier for kids. WHO has listed measures that can be taken to protect children from the harmful effects of air pollution. Check those measures below.

The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), while making the announcement said the move is part of the various measures adopted by the Delhi government to combat pollution under the GRAP-II stage. ""As part of the various measures being adopted by the Delhi government to combat pollution under GRAP-II stage, DMRC will be running 40 additional train trips on weekdays (Mon-Fri) across its network starting from tomorrow,"" said the DMRC spokesperson. ""This has been planned to intensify the use of public transport among passengers across Delhi-NCR. Usually, over 4300 trips are performed by Delhi Metro trains everyday,"" it added. The DMRC move comes days after the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM)'s sub-committee invoked restrictions under GRAP-2 in to curb air pollution. The Centre's air quality panel on October 21)directed authorities in the National Capital Region (NCR) to increase parking fees to discourage private transport and enhance CNG or electric bus and metro services, amid a likely increase in pollution levels. The action comes as part of 'Stage II' of the central government's pollution control plan known as the 'Graded Response Action Plan' (GRAP), which is implemented in the Delhi-NCR to combat air pollution during the winter season. GRAP categorises actions into four stages: Stage I – 'Poor' (AQI 201-300); Stage II – 'Very Poor' (AQI 301-400); Stage III – 'Severe' (AQI 401-450); and Stage IV – 'Severe Plus' (AQI >450). Stage I mandates the suspension of work at private construction and demolition projects with a plot size equal to or exceeding 500 square metres that are not registered on the state government's portal for remote monitoring of dust mitigation measures. Delhi Environment Minister, Gopal Rai, has announced a unique initiative, 'Red Light On, Gaadi Off,' aimed at curbing air pollution in the national capital as the Odd-Even traffic rule remains on hold. With deteriorating air quality and rising pollution levels, the Delhi government is taking immediate steps to address the crisis. Gopal Rai emphasised the need for every Delhiite to contribute to air quality improvement, and as such, the 'Red Light On, Gaadi Off' campaign will be initiated from Thursday. Rai said the government is preparing to combat pollution ahead of Deepawali. “As the Diwali festival is around the corner, the Delhi government is making an all-round preparation to combat pollution. We are looking at every trivial factor that might aid in increasing pollution in Delhi. We are prepared to take strict action on those who violate the norms. The government is also preparing the ‘Winter action plan’”, the minister was quoted by news agency ANI as saying. “Though we have banned firecrackers in Delhi. But the public too needs to cooperate with the government. Since everyone out there is grappling with pollution, one needs to make a point that one does not promote activities that might lead to an increase in toxicity in the air. Through everyone's cooperation, we can achieve the goal of a clean environment”, Rai added. India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientist VK Soni told ANI on Monday that there will be some improvement in the air quality after the implementation of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), but it will remain in the 'very poor' category until October 26.

There is growing evidence indicating that air pollution increases the risk of breast cancer. Air pollutants, mainly particulate matter PM 2.5 and PM 10 that are associated with premature heart attacks and deaths are now suspected of increasing the risk of breast cancer for women. Two international studies in the US and France, have shown a correlation between indoor and outdoor exposure to particulate matter and breast cancer. There are multiple studies linking PM 2.5, particles formed in the atmosphere through chemical reactions of gases such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and certain organic compounds, with premature death, particularly in people who have chronic heart or lung diseases and reduced lung function growth in children. However, the study had a limited ability to investigate the differences in the association between air pollution and breast cancer across study areas. Investigators recommended future studies to explore how regional differences in air pollution impact breast cancer incidence. The US study which was published in the Journal of the National Cancer Insitute, found an 8% increase in breast cancer incidence among those who are living in areas with higher PM 2.5 exposure. The study followed five lakh women and men over a 20-year period and found 15,870 breast cancer cases. According to the report, Dr Parmar mentioned that in India, the incidence of breast cancer increased by 50 % between 1965 and 1985. As per the Globocan data of 2020 in India, breast cancer accounted for 13.5% of all cancer cases and 10.6% of all deaths. Studies estimate the global burden of breast cancer is expected to cross almost 20 lakh by the year 2030. Different people have different symptoms of breast cancer. Some people do not have any signs of symptoms at all. Some warning signs of breast cancer are: -New lump in the breast or underarm. -Thickening or swelling of part of the breast. -Irritation or dimpling of breast skin. -Redness or flaky skin in the nipple area or the breast. -Nipple discharge other than breast milk, including blood. -Any change in the size or the shape of the breast. -Pain in any area of the breast. Many conditions can cause lumps in the breast, including cancer. However, most breast lumps are caused by other medical conditions. Two common causes of breast lumps are fibrocystic breast condition and cysts. Fibrocystic condition causes noncancerous changes in the breast that can make them lumpy, tender, and sore. Cysts are small fluid-filled sacs that can develop in the breast. Also read: 10 deaths in 24 hours while performing Garba! Can dancing trigger heart attack?

""I urge you to galvanise all available resources and make the farmers willing partners in defeating this deadly menace,"" he said in the letter. On Saturday, the minimum temperature in the national capital on Saturday settled at 21.4 degree Celsius, two notches above the season's average, officials said. Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) stood at 260, in the 'poor' category, around 8 am. The IMD has predicted a mainly clear sky becoming partly cloudy towards afternoon or evening. The maximum temperature is likely to settle at 36 degrees Celsius. The humidity at 8.30 am was recorded at 83 per cent. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. Meanwhile, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday said the city government has formed interdepartmental teams to improve air quality at the 13 air pollution hotspots in the capital. The 13 identified hotspots are Narela, Bawana, Mundka, Wazirpur, Rohini, R K Puram, Okhla, Jahangirpuri, Anand Vihar, Punjabi Bagh, Mayapuri, Dwarka. These hotspots were identified based on the annual average concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 in these areas.

Citing sources, Geo News reported that a new policy is likely to come in effect under which government departments will operate with 50% efficiency on Wednesdays and snap-checking will be carried out on weekends. Earlier it was reported that all schools, markets and offices will be closed on Wednesday (October 11). However, the Lahore Commissioner's Office said on Tuesday that they will remain open tomorrow and their closure was subject to approval from the provincial government. ""The proposal of work from home in educational institutions and offices will be submitted to the Punjab government and it will make a final decision in this regard,"" said the spokesperson for the commissioner's office. The provincial government has blamed the worsening air pollution on unusual traffic and emissions from factories that are contributing 7% to the pollution amid visible smog in the city. The highest level of smog was recorded from the first three days of last week. According to sources, a suggestion has been passed to impose heavy fines on factories violating the shutdown policy and they will be shut down in case of continuous ignorance of the directives passed by the government. Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa said the authorities will announce a work-from-home policy for two months to combat rising pollution in the Lahore Division. The commissioner said this after he along with CCPO Bilal Siddiqui met traders to discuss the proposal to keep markets closed on Wednesdays. “Traders can open markets on Sundays if they want,"" the commissioner said, adding that they supported the measure to keep markets closed on Wednesdays. It is worth noticing that Lahore constantly ranks as one of the top polluted cities in the world. In 2022, Lahore became the world's worst polluted city, according to IQAir. Lahore's air quality worsened from 86.5 to 97.4 micrograms of PM 2.5 particles per cubic metre. According to the News International, the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute (EPIC) in its Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) said that air pollution is the second greatest threat to human health in Pakistan, reducing 3.9 years of life on average. Pakistan is unable the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines of limiting the average annual PM 2.5 concentration to 5 micrograms per cubic metre. All of Pakistan's 240 million people live in areas that exceed the WHO guidelines. Punjab, Islamabad, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are the most polluted provinces of Pakistan.

The Graded Response Action Plan is a  set of anti-air pollution measures followed in the Delhi-NCR region in the winter season. The Commission for Air Quality Management, an autonomous body tasked with improving air quality in Delhi and the adjoining areas, had made crucial changes to the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) last year and again in July this year. The new changes include strict restrictions on the plying of overaged vehicles and a complete ban on the use of coal and firewood in eateries, restaurants and hotels when the air quality index (AQI) breaches the 200 mark. BS III petrol and BS IV diesel four-wheelers will be immediately banned in Delhi and Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Gautam Buddh Nagar if the Air Quality Index (AQI) crosses the 400 mark. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), a statutory body formed under an Act in 2021, had amended the GRAP in July last year to ensure proactive implementation of anti-air pollution steps based on forecasts up to three days in advance. Earlier, the authorities would implement these measures, including banning construction and demolition works, entry of high-emission vehicles and the use of coal and firewood, only after the pollution level touched a particular threshold.   The GRAP for the National Capital Region (NCR) is classified under four different stages of adverse air quality in Delhi: Stage I - 'Poor' (AQI 201-300); Stage II - 'Very Poor' (AQI 301-400); Stage III - 'Severe' (AQI 401-450); and Stage IV - 'Severe Plus' (AQI >450). The revised GRAP recommends strict enforcement of the orders of the Supreme Court and the National Green Tribunal on overaged diesel and petrol vehicles under Stage 1. It also calls for a complete ban on the use of coal and firewood in eateries, restaurants and hotels as soon as the AQI crosses the 200 mark. Earlier, the authorities would implement this measure under Stage 2 (AQI above 300). New steps suggested as part of the revised GRAP include ""strict action to curb air pollution at all identified hotspots in the region under Stage 2"". Under Stage 3, states will have to impose strict restrictions on the plying of BS III petrol and BS IV diesel four-wheelers in Delhi and Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Gautam Buddh Nagar. Authorities may discontinue physical classes in schools for children up to Class V in such a scenario, the CAQM suggested. At AQI above 450, four-wheelers registered outside Delhi, other than electric vehicles and those using CNG and BS-VI diesel, will not be permitted to enter Delhi. However, those carrying essential commodities or providing essential services are exempt. All other existing measures taken under different stages of GRAP will continue.

Arvind Kejriwal also said that pollution levels declined in the national capital due to government initiatives as he announced the winter action plan to curb pollution. CM Kejriwal said, ""In Punjab, we formed our Government in March last year (2022). The data from last year shows the steps taken in 6-7 months led to a 30 per cent reduction in stubble burning. This year Bhagwant Mann has taken several steps. One of which is the diversification of crops- instead of paddy grow other crops. This will save water and lower stubble burning. It has yielded good results. Secondly, the varieties of paddy - the short-term varieties have. This has less stubble and it need not be burnt. Ex-situ management of stubble - for this a few companies have adopted districts and will carry their stubble to convert it into manure or electricity. I think there should be improvement this year."" Delhi CM on industrial units: ""There were two thermal power plants in Delhi, both of them have been shut now. Heavy fines are being imposed over those responsible for dust pollution. Industrial units in Delhi earlier used polluting fuel but now they have been shifted to piped natural gas (PNG),"" said Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Friday. Winter action plan: Announcing the winter action plan, Kejriwal said the Pusa biodecomposer that prevents stubble burning will be sprayed on 5,000 hectares of farmland this year against 4,400 hectares last year. The Pusa biodecomposer, developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) here, is a microbial solution that can turn paddy straw into manure in 15-20 days. The government will deploy 530 water sprinklers to prevent dust pollution and 385 teams will check vehicles' pollution certificates and prevent the plying of overage cars. In 2018, the Supreme Court banned diesel and petrol vehicles older than 10 and 15 years, respectively, in Delhi. It had added that the vehicles plying in violation of the order would be impounded. A 2014 order of the National Green Tribunal bars vehicles older than 15 years to be parked in public places. Kejriwal said burning garbage in the open is banned in Delhi and 611 teams will monitor its implementation. He also urged people to download the Green Delhi mobile application and report any pollution-causing activity to the government.

It is essential to clarify that there is no such proposal currently under active consideration by the government. In line with our commitments to achieve Carbon Net Zero by 2070 and to reduce air pollution levels caused by hazardous fuels like diesel, as well as the rapid growth in automobile sales, it is imperative to actively embrace cleaner and greener alternative fuels. These fuels should be import substitutes, cost-effective, indigenous, and pollution-free."" There were reports earlier that in another attempt to curb air pollution, the Union government is planning to impose an additional 10% tax on diesel engine vehicles. As measures to air pollution, the government is already planning to ban BS III petrol and BS IV diesel four-wheelers immediately in Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Gautam Buddh Nagar if the AQI crosses the 400 mark.

According to the research presented at the European Respiratory Society International Congress in Milan, Italy, women living in greener areas gave birth to babies with slightly higher birth weight (27g heavier on average) than mothers living in less green areas. The children with low birth weight face a higher risk of asthma and higher rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) as they grow older. Also Read: Cyberbullying may lead to eating disorders in adolescents, finds study “The time when babies are growing in the womb is critical for lung development. We know that babies with lower birth weight are susceptible to chest infections, and this can lead on to problems like asthma and COPD later on,” said Robin Mzati Sinsamala, a researcher in the Department of Global Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Bergen (UiB) in Norway. “Our results suggest that pregnant women exposed to air pollution, even at relatively low levels, give birth to smaller babies. They also suggest that living in a greener area could help counteract this effect. It could be that green areas tend to have lower traffic or that plants help to clear the air of pollution, or green areas may mean it’s easier for pregnant women to be physically active.” he added. The study included 4,286 children and their mothers living in five European countries (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland and Estonia). Researchers compared the babies birth weights by taking account of factors that affect birth weight, such as mother’s age, whether the mothers smoked or had any other health conditions.

The Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) in association with Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur, has already installed indigenously developed sensor-based AQMs in 432 blocks, covering 33 districts, in the state. ""Work is on to install AQMs in the remaining 102 blocks in the state by the end of this month. From September 1 this year, the BSPCB will start getting real-time AQM reports from all 534 blocks, covering 38 administrative districts. Bihar will become the first state in India to get AQM reports from indigenously developed sensor-based systems from the block level. Currently, there are only 41 air sensors in Bihar and they have been installed in urban areas"", BSPCB chairman Devendra Kumar Shukla said. ""The AQM reports will help identify factors responsible for increase in air pollution at any spot, such as vehicles, dust, biomass burning, and emissions from industries so that preventive measures can be taken accordingly. Air pollution remains a major challenge in our state"", he added. Shukla said that improving the air quality of several rural and urban hot spots of air pollution in the state is the top priority of the Bihar government. The AQM reports from the rural areas will aide the policymakers and researchers understand the situation developing on the ground, he said. ""Authorities concerned will also be in a position to evaluate the difference between rural and urban air quality after completion of the project,"" he added. The BSPCB recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Institute of Environment and Sustainable Development, Banaras Hindu University (BHU), to conduct a real-time source apportionment study. This will help identify the sources of air pollution in the extended urban areas of Patna. The study will be completed by September 2024. ""This is also a crucial study that will find out the level of toxicity in the air. Apart from conducting emission inventory, carrying capacity and source apportionment of particulate matter pollution, experts will also collect data on the contribution of river bed material (soil) and source of road dust"", the BSPCB chairman said. Shukla said said that this study is aimed at investigating a seasonal mass concentration level of PM2.5 and PM10 in ambient air of urban area of Patna. PM stands for Particulate Matter. PM2.5 and PM10 are minute particles present in the air and exposure to it is harmful to health.

178,IndiaTV News,https://www.indiatvnews.com/health/effective-tips-to-shield-yourself-from-dust-storm-2023-05-18-871303,Effective tips to shield yourself from dust storm,"Published : May 18, 2023 16:31 IST, Updated : May 18, 2023 16:31 IST","Dust storms and worsening air pollution can leave you with several health problems. These storms typically happen during dry conditions. Strong wind conditions can pick up soil and blow it into vast clouds that can wreak havoc on the health and safety of anyone in their path. Dust Storms are not only causing an impact on human health, but also on the environment and the economy in arid and semi-arid regions such as Northern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Central Asia, and China. Here’s what you should do to shield yourself from air pollution and avoid the harmful effects of air pollution: 1. One of the easiest precautions we can take to reduce the impact is to wear a N95-grade mask, which fits snugly, around the mouth and nose, so that all air passes through the mask. A basic surgical mask actually offers no protection against air pollutants and microbes. 2. Air filters have proven to be instrumental in enhancing indoor air quality by effectively filtering and purifying the surrounding air. The utilization of air filters can lay a pivotal role in alleviating dust allergies and improving overall respiratory health by creating a cleaner and healthier indoor environment. 3. Apple cider vinegar has been hailed as a natural remedy for dust allergies, which consists of inflammatory and expectorant properties. It is believed to help alleviate those experiencing cold. It also helps in managing allergy symptoms and promoting overall respiratory well-being. 4. Drink herbal teas, such as chamomile or nettle, which are known for their anti-inflammatory properties. 5. Consume a diet, which is rich in fruits, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acids to support your immune system. 6. Apply a warm compress to your eyes to soothe itchiness and irritation. 7. To ease nasal congestion caused by dust allergies, natural remedies can offer a comforting solution. Two such remedies worth considering are eucalyptus oil and steam inhalation. Eucalyptus oil is known for its potential decongestant properties, while steam inhalation helps to moisturize the nasal passages and relieve congestion. 8. Adopt a Mediterranean diet. It’s low in meat and dairy, but rich in fresh fruits and vegetables, beans, nuts, and healthy fats. This diet can protect you from some of the harmful effects of air pollution and reduce your risk of dying from heart attacks and stroke. 9. If you have asthma, don’t forget to take your steroid inhaler with you and keep it on the regular dose. There is a small percentage of patients who don’t need a regular inhaler. You need to keep your inhaler handy so that you don’t feel uncomfortable. 10. Plants are an excellent and cheap source of purifying the air. So buying plant trees, would not only make your house look good, they also help in protecting you.

A new study reveals a biological process that may be behind that link - a discovery which could provide new insights on better ways to treat or prevent diseases related to pollution exposure. The study found that exposure to ambient nanoparticles, or very small pollutants in the air, activates a cellular defence mechanism known as autophagy, which may reduce the ability of cells to fight off other potential harms. This may help explain why air pollution increases a person's risk for a number of acute and chronic lung diseases, including lung cancer, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. ""We know that diseases, especially lung diseases, can result from air pollution exposure. What we don't know are the mechanisms by which that occurs,"" said Edward Crandall, Professor of pathology, at the Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California (USC). For the first time, the researchers found that, when exposed to nanoparticles, autophagy activity in cells seems to reach an upper threshold. ""The implication of these studies is that autophagy is a defence mechanism that has an upper limit, beyond which it can't defend the cell any further,"" Crandall said. According to IANS, In the study, published in the journal Autophagy Reports, the researchers conducted a series of tests using lung adenocarcinoma cells. They first exposed the cells to nanoparticles, then to rapamycin (a chemical known to stimulate autophagy), then to both nanoparticles and rapamycin. In every case, autophagy activity reached the same upper threshold and did not increase further. Consequently, cells may lack the ability to further boost autophagy to defend against other dangers, such as smoke inhalation or a viral or bacterial infection. While autophagy is a boon for healthy cells, it makes cancer cells harder to destroy. Developing methods to raise or lower autophagy in cells could be a key way to protect against and treat disease, the team said.

Factors such as age, hypertension (high blood pressure), smoking, inactivity, social isolation, and sadness can increase the risk of dementia. A recent study found that exposure to air pollution increases dementia risk, as does exposure to nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxide. The results by BMJ suggest that air pollutants are risk factors for dementia, and caution should be taken when interpreting these findings. The number of people living with dementia has surpassed 57 million, which is rising significantly. Since there aren't many interventions available to slow or stop dementia's onset, no definitive conclusions were drawn. The study was conducted to address the growing number of people living with dementia. They discovered 51 research studies revealing links between air pollution averaged over a year or more and adult dementia diagnoses. Researchers found a correlation between increased dementia risk and increased exposure to fine particle pollution after incorporating 16 papers, largely from North America and Europe. According to 14 studies that particularly addressed the impact of PM2.5 on dementia, the risk of dementia increased by 4% for every 2 ug/m3 increase in the average yearly PM2.5 concentration. Results from studies revealed that for every 2 ug/m3 rise in the average yearly PM2.5 concentration, the risk of dementia increased by 42%, with the most conservative estimate putting the danger at higher than 17%. The studies also claimed an increase in the risk of dementia associated with exposure to nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxide.

This is a significant increase in poor air quality in comparison to the same period in 2022 and 2021, where the city only saw two days with poor AQI, and none in 2020. Pollutants such as PM 10 and PM 2.5 were the major contributors to this increase. Experts have stated that real estate and infrastructure work, along with transportation, are the main reasons for this rise in air pollution. Heavy traffic and low winter temperatures were also cited as possible causes. The report's findings are the second such report on deteriorating air quality in Mumbai in recent times. According to a report by IQAir, a Swiss company that tracks global air quality, Mumbai ranked as the second most polluted city in the world between January 29 and February 8. Experts attribute the rise in pollution levels to the dust and smoke generated by vehicles and construction activities. ALSO READ: 'Delhi not on list of world's most polluted cities', says CM Arvind Kejriwal clarifying media report Between November 2022 and January 2023, Mumbai had the most days with 'poor' or 'very poor' air quality. An AQI of 201-300 is considered poor, while 301-400 is considered very poor, and 401-500 severe. To address the problem, authorities in Mumbai must take immediate steps to reduce emissions from vehicles and construction sites. The government should encourage the use of cleaner modes of transportation and enforce strict regulations to control air pollution. The public can also take measures to protect themselves from the harmful effects of air pollution, such as wearing masks when outdoors, and limiting outdoor activities when the AQI is poor TOP NEWS JPC on Waqf Bill: Huge uproar erupts, Owaisi and 9 other MPs suspended from today's meeting Saif Ali Khan stabbing case: Court extends accused's police custody till January 29 ICC announces ODI Team of 2024, no Indian on list LATEST NEWS US arrests over 500 illegal immigrants as mass deportations begin after Trump's takeover Delhi CM Atishi alleges conspiracy being hatched to kill Arvind Kejriwal ahead of Assembly polls Shalimar Bagh Assembly Election: Will AAP's Bandana Kumari maintain her winning momentum in 2025? 5 national parks near Delhi you can visit during the weekend © 2009-2025 Independent News Service.

Delhi would become the first city in the country to get a realtime source segmentation of air pollution that will help in identifying factors responsible for increase in air pollution at any place in Delhi, Delhi Environment minister Gopal Rai said on Sunday (January 29). ""The super site facility is located at Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya premises near ITO. The project has been initiated by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) in collaboration with IIT Kanpur, IIT Delhi, and TERI,” Rai said in a statement. The pollution forecasts will also help the government in taking policy decisions in time, the state Environment minister said. The launch of the super site is one of the most important aspects of Delhi's campaign to combat pollution. Based on the data, this super site will also assist in forecasting air pollution levels enabling the government to deploy its resources to combat pollution, he said.

Protection, precaution and more","Published : Jan 18, 2023 11:42 IST, Updated : Jan 18, 2023 11:42 IST","As Delhi-NCR reels under massive air pollution after Diwali every year, leaving people with respiratory illnesses gasping for fresh air, experts said that as most people spend winter days inside and even though the indoor air quality may appear to be better than outdoor air quality, it can be up to five times worse. The indoor and outdoor air pollution are often treated as two separate entities but outdoor pollutants, such as vehicle exhaust fumes, pollen and mould spores, can also enter our indoor spaces. According to Dr Vipul Gupta, Chief - Neurointerventional Surgery and Co-Chief Stroke Unit at Artemis Hospital in Gurugram, it is believed that indoor air pollution is worse than outdoor air pollution as it is in a contained area which enables the potential pollutants to harm us even more. The harmful dust, dirt and gases present inside buildings are linked to several health concerns like cardiovascular diseases, chronic lung diseases and/or development of several infections. The main cause behind indoor air pollution is known to be gases or particles released into the air, substances like building materials, tobacco smoke, wood-burning stoves cause indoor pollution. Once inside, they can react with indoor pollutants, creating a complex cocktail of dirty air. ""Likewise, indoor pollutants, such as smoke from burning wood or cooking fumes, can exit buildings through ventilation. For example, air fresheners and deodorants may contain Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and benzene, while cleaning products can contain benzene and household fumes and odours,"" Ginger Lee, Senior Electronics Engineer, at consumer electronics company Dyson. Furniture and carpets can also emit formaldehyde and flame retardants that accumulate in the air, while emissions from cooking appliances, such as ovens and stoves, may contain a range of substances that deteriorate indoor air quality. ""As modern homes generally have better sealing, these pollutants can become trapped and are unable to escape,"" said Lee. According to a report in the Indian Journal of Community Medicine, statistics suggest that in developing countries, health impacts of indoor air pollution far outweigh those of outdoor air pollution. Around 4.2 million people die prematurely due to indoor air pollution, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Lee said that their purifiers make the invisible visible, helping users to understand the types of pollution they are exposed to on a daily basis and giving peace of mind that these pollutants are being captured and that they are breathing clean air indoors. The HEPA+Carbon filter removes 99.95 per cent of pollutants as small as 0.1 microns such as allergens, bacteria, pollen and mould spores and harmful gases. People should ensure ventilation as it will freshen the air present inside the room and will help in removing the polluted air. Along with ventilation, decluttering or cleaning your rooms/households every now and then is important for never letting dust settle and trap pollutants inside. Indoor plants are also a great way to prevent indoor air pollution as they will purify the air quality present inside.

It brings along enthusiasm for Christmas, Santa, Snow, and delicious delicacies. But with the changes in the environment, winters can be dreadful for some people. It is so because of the smog and the respiratory problems that we have to go through. Winter is synonymous with smog. Unfortunately not just that, but also pollution, respiratory disorders like asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, cold, cough, lung fibrosis, and even cardiovascular problems. Those with existing lung problems like asthma that cause inflammation of the airways may suffer during the winter season. Those with asthma tend to experience worsened symptoms during winter or are more likely to have an asthma attack, because they spend more time indoors. They can get a cold or the flu, since the air outside is cold and dry. Drinking plenty of water is a must even in winters. People tend to cut down on their water intake due to the cold. But not drinking enough water will only result in clogged airways. To keep respiratory organs clean, you can even take some steam time and again. Try not to do any physical exercise in smoggy weather, particularly at midday when ground ozone levels are at their highest. Try to change the times you exercise to morning or evening (avoiding rush hour), or exercise inside. Yes, laugh as much as possible. It helps clean our lungs. Since our abdomen expands, the lungs get rid of the existing air and fill in the fresh air. So it is a great therapy to keep the lungs healthy. It would be best if you try avoiding going out when there is too much smog. But if it is too important, never skip the mask. The pollutants in the air will directly go through your nozzles into your lungs. So wear a firm mask to avoid this. Smoking is hazardous, more so for people with existing respiratory problems such as asthma and chronic inflammatory lung disease (COPD). Even second-hand smoke is dangerous, especially when the level of air pollution is high.

We are building roads worth Rs 60,000 cr around Delhi, which will make the area free from traffic jams. We brought electric vehicles and green hydrogen,” said Gadkari. However, he admitted that solving Delhi's pollution problem is little difficult but not impossible. ""The amount of work done in building roads in 8 years wasn't done in the last 65 years. I think that before 2024 ends India's road infrastructure will be equal to that of America's road infrastructure.

If Central government, state government, municipal corporation and farmers make efforts together then we can solve the problem. We should forget politics and work together regarding it,” he asserted. 'India needs liberal economic policy' Addressing TIOL Awards 2022 event, Gadkari said India needs a liberal economic policy with the intention to provide its benefits to poor people of the country. He added the economic reforms started by Manmohan Singh as finance minister in 1991 gave a new direction to India. The road transport and highways minister said the country is indebted to former prime minister Singh for economic reforms. He recalled that he could raise money to build roads in Maharashtra when he was a minister in Maharashtra in the mid-1990s due to economic reforms initiated by the former prime minister.

The curbs were imposed three days ago. The Sub-Committee revoked the order, issued on November 3, 2022, for actions under Stage-IV of the GRAP (Graded Response Action Plan in Delhi-NCR) with immediate effect. Actions under Stages-I to Stage-III of GRAP shall however remain invoked & be implemented, monitored & reviewed. Actions under Stages-I to Stage-III of the GRAP shall however remain invoked and be implemented, monitored, and reviewed by all agencies concerned in the entire NCR to ensure that the AQI levels do not slip further to the ‘Severe’/ ‘Severe +’ category, officials said. Post lifting of Stage-IV GRAP in Delhi-NCR, the ban on non-BS VI diesel-run light motor vehicles, and entry of trucks into the national capital have also been revoked, CAQM said. Delhi AQI improves from severe to very poor Delhi's air pollution levels ameliorated marginally to the lower end of the ""very poor"" category primarily due to favourable wind speed and a drop in the contribution of stubble burning. The 24-hour average air quality index stood at 339 at 4 pm, dropping from 381 a day ago. It was 447 on Friday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board. It had jumped to 450 on Thursday, just a notch short of the 'severe plus' category, prompting authorities to invoke the final stage of anti-pollution curbs, including a ban on non-BS VI diesel light motor vehicles. The number of farm fires in Punjab dropped sharply to 599 from 2,817 a day ago, data from the Indian Agricultural Research Organisation (IARI) showed. According to Safar, a forecasting agency under the Ministry of Earth and Sciences, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution also declined to 18 per cent from 21 per cent on Saturday. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his Punjab counterpart, Bhagwant Mann, had owned responsibility on Friday for paddy straw burning in the agrarian state and promised to curb the practice by the next winter. The number of stubble-burning incidents in Punjab rose by 12.59 per cent year-on-year to 26,583 in the last 50 days with a spurt in such cases after Diwali, according to Indian Council of Agricultural Research. In comparison, the number of paddy stubble-burning events in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi remained lower between September 15 and November 4 this year, the data stated. The hazardous pollution levels prompted the Delhi government to announce on Friday that primary schools would remain shut from Saturday and 50 per cent of its staff will work from home, while private offices have been advised to follow suit. A six-member panel chaired by the special commissioner of transport has been set up to monitor the implementation of curbs on anti-polluting activities. Revenue commissioners have been asked to prepare a plan for staggered timings of markets and offices. In a bid to ramp up public transport, the government will also launch 'Paryavaran Bus Service', which will include 500 privately-run CNG buses. In a bid to reduce vehicular emissions, Environment Minister Gopal Rai also appealed to the chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to take measures to divert trucks carrying non-essential goods on peripheral expressways to avoid traffic jams at the capital's borders. Kejriwal had said the odd-even car rationing scheme would be implemented if the need arises and discussions on it were on. According to a study conducted by The Energy and Resources Institute in 2018, vehicular emissions account for around 40 per cent of the PM 2.5 pollution in the capital.

Though awareness campaigns regarding those highlighting the harms of stubble burning were held, they did not show better results. According to the data of Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) of NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), which is also used by the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB), close to 800 different fire farm incidents were reported in the last fortnight from 18 districts. These comprise Aligarh, Barabanki, Fatehpur, Kanpur Nagar, Mathura, Hardoi, Sambhal, Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Meerut, Saharanpur, Rampur, Lakhimpur Kheri, Pilibhit, Shahjahanpur, Bulandshahr, Shamli and Bareilly districts. While the government is urging farmers to adopt alternative means to dispose of stubble, the growers claim that the suggested measures are ""impractical"". Gurupal Singh, a farmer of Powayan in Shahjahanpur, said, ""The easiest way for us to dispose of stubble is to burn them. Other measures like uprooting them with special equipment, spraying biochemicals etc are labour intensive that cost money. ""This also needs to be done quickly to prepare the field for the next crop. In such a case, poor farmers like me are left with no option but to burn the stubble,"" he said. Singh said he was penalised for stubble burning in 2019. Apart from holding awareness campaigns, the district administration is also slapping such farmers with fines. In Rampur, the district administration has imposed a fine of Rs 55,000 on different farmers across the district for stubble burning in a week. According to district officials, Rs 32,500 of this have been collected as fine so far. Similarly, in Fatehpur district, the administration has collected Rs 27,000 as fine from farmers involved in stubble burning. The Fatehpur district administration has also seized 16 harvesters operating without the necessary equipment to reduce stubble waste. According to the directives of the state government, for anyone caught burning agricultural residue or waste in fields in Uttar Pradesh, the fine is Rs 2,500 for fields less than two acres, Rs 5,000 for two-five acres and Rs 15,000 for fields above five acres. Assistant Divisional Magistrate (Finance) of Bulandshahr, Vivek Kumar Mishra said, ""Apart from fines, the farmers can face up to six months of imprisonment on repeat offences. We have intimated this to farmers in awareness camps held in the district. The village heads have been asked to remain vigilant and report any incident of stubble burning."" Bulandshahr in western Uttar Pradesh is one of the districts with the worst air quality in the state. The district administration has organised more than two dozen awareness camps to educate farmers about harms of stubble burning. Teams have also been formed at tehsil level to present such incidents, said the officer. The district administration has roped in village heads to prevent stubble burning. District Magistrate of Sultanpur Raveesh Gupta said, ""The village heads have been asked to lodge an FIR against anyone involved in stubble burning. The village heads have been asked to take a picture of the incident which is mandatory to lodge FIR."" Two farmers were fined Rs 2,500 each for stubble burning in the district on October 31. Similar action will be taken against anyone found burning stubble, he warned. The recent action which indicates more stringent steps are on the anvil is in line with a government order issued to all divisional commissioners, district magistrates, and district police chiefs last month by the office of Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary Durga Shankar Mishra. The top bureaucrat in his letter asked the officials to ensure legal penal action against farmers found burning crop residues, and also create awareness among them about the negative impact farm fires can have on the environment. According to government sources, these legal penal actions also include lodging FIRs against repeat offenders of stubble burning. The burning of crop residues and garbage is seen as a major cause of air pollution during winter. The air quality worsens every year in the October-November period when paddy harvesting is done. These fire incidents are expected to spike in the coming days, agriculture scientists claim. ""The paddy cultivation in Uttar Pradesh was delayed by an average of 35 days this year because of poor and delayed monsoon. Because of this, the paddy harvest is expected to continue till the last week of November,"" said Senior Scientist of Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) Shubham Singh. The delay in harvest can be a troubling sign for the air quality if stubble-burning incidents continue, he said. ""The temperatures will drop further by the end of November as winter sets in. If stubble burning is done in such weather conditions, it will take smoke longer to settle down, keeping the air polluted for a longer period of time,"" explained Singh.

On Friday (November 4) during the corresponding morning period the AQI of the capital city was recorded at 472. Also, areas in the national capital region (NCR) area - Noida and Gurugram at 7 am this morning recorded an AQI of 529 and 478 respectively both in the highly toxic 'severe'. Dhirpur in West Delhi recorded an AQI of 534.On Friday, SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research) said that stubble-burning accounted for 34 per cent to Delhi's particulate matter (PM) 2.5 pollution. Air Quality Index from 0 to 100 is considered as good, while from 100 to 200 it is moderate, from 200 to 300 it is poor, and from 300 to 400 it is said to be very poor and from 400 to 500 or above it is considered as severe. People of Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) complained of choking and 'eye burning' due to smog and air pollution leaving people gasping for breath. Measures to curb pollution: Earlier on Friday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal along with Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann held a press conference and urged the central government to come forward and lead measures to check severe smog in the national capital region.Kejriwal and Mann said that the AAP governments are in Punjab and Delhi. This is not the time to raise fingers or abuse each other. If they say, Kejriwal is responsible and we say they are responsible, this will not solve the problem of smog in NCR, they added. ""We do not want to play blame game, we are responsible (for smog in NCR)"", they added. CM Kejriwal announced that primary schools in Delhi would be closed from November 5.Besides, the outdoor activity of students of the above fifth standard has been banned.The Delhi government is also mulling implementing the odd-even norms for plying of vehicles in Delhi to contain the pollution caused by vehicular emission, he added. However, the forecast predicts that the condition of air quality in Delhi and nearby regions will continue to deteriorate further and expects improvement from November 5.""Air quality is likely to remain within 'Severe' today and likely to improve tomorrow to 'lower end of Severe' and from 5th onwards air quality is likely to improve further to 'Very poor' due to upper-level wind reversal that prevents inflow of stubble-related pollutants. Higher surface wind speed on 5th Nov is likely to disperse pollutants,"" said a press release. The sprinkling of water is being done in the Sarai Kale Khan area, as a measure against the rise in Air Quality Index in the national capital today. Meanwhile, violation of the Delhi government's ban on plying of certain vehicles owing to the rise in pollution will attract a penalty of Rs 20,000, a senior official said on Friday. Delhi's air quality remained ""severe"" for a second day on the trot, with stubble burning accounting for 30 per cent of the PM2.5 pollution in the capital, according to the Central Pollution Control Board and SAFAR, a forecasting agency under the Ministry of Earth and Sciences. Delhi government has decided to implement the anti-pollution curbs recommended by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), including a ban on non-BS VI diesel-run light motor vehicles. Also, any diesel truck would not be allowed entry into Delhi except for those carrying essential commodities or providing essential services. However, all CNG and electric trucks would be allowed to enter Delhi, according to an order by the Transport Department. Diesel-operated medium and heavy goods vehicles registered in Delhi will not be allowed to ply in Delhi except those carrying essential commodities or providing essential services. The order issued by Delhi Transport Department also states that the BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel light motor vehicle will be banned from plying in the areas under the jurisdiction of the NCT of Delhi.

According to Central Pollution Control Board data, Delhi's overall Air Quality Index (AQI) stood at 426 at 9.30 am on Friday. An AQI of above 400 is considered 'Severe' and can affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing illnesses. On Thursday, the 24-hour average AQI stood at 450 at 4 pm, just a notch below the 'Severe Plus' category. Demand for air purifiers has risen in the national capital, particularly after Diwali, which witnessed widespread bursting of firecrackers despite a ban. ""The air quality in India is deteriorating due to many activities – industrial expansion in cities, population density, improper waste management, crop burning, increased automobile use and a few natural causes. There is evidence that air pollution, both outdoor and indoor, is on the rise and is behind higher morbidity and mortality rates,"" said Kartik Singhal, founder of O2 Cure and managing director at Zeco Aircon Ltd. The spike in air purifier sales reflects the deteriorating air quality levels, he said, adding that buyers from major cities such as Delhi, Gurgaon, and Noida had become more aware and responsible about indoor purification. ""This has led to an increase in the air purifier sector where we have also observed a massive jump in sales during the past few weeks,"" Singhal added. A representative from Mehra Electronics in Khan Market concurred. ""This is the need of the hour. It is peak pollution time and the sales have seen an increase,"" he said. Market experts said air purifier sales were higher in south Delhi since people living there had higher purchasing power and better awareness. The appliance has become a necessity now and even doctors are advising patients to use it, said Manish Seth, secretary of the Daryaganj Traders' Association and the owner of an electronics store. ""Companies have also realised this and reduced the prices. Purifiers that were earlier available for Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 are now being sold for Rs 7,000 to Rs 8,000. In some south Delhi stores, the sales are higher because people have better awareness and higher purchasing power. The product is also moving on its own in the online space,"" he said. Mohit Singh, a sales executive at Atmo Pure in Jangpura, said the cost of air purifiers at their store ranged between Rs 7,000 and Rs 60,000, depending on the technology, the filters used and the coverage area. ""We have seen a sharp rise in demand for air purifiers around this time for the last few years. It is literally the cost of your breath, a health investment as important as your regular health insurance,"" he added. Singh said a larger number of users bought the purifiers for their children and the elderly and invested in equipment with a low maintenance cost. Nitin Sharma, a senior executive at Global Gadgets Store in Khan Market, said, ""As the air quality deteriorated after Diwali, sales have gone up. The sales will go up in the upcoming days."" ''While we may be aware of outdoor air pollution, awareness of indoor air pollution remains low, and this can be up to 10 times worse than outdoor air pollution. There are a number of ways to help improve your personal air quality exposure such as adapting your daily routine to include fewer polluting activities, as well as using a purifier to control your indoor air quality."" ''Dyson's purifying technology senses air quality, allowing you to monitor and remove pollutants inside your home. Combined with our air multiplier technology and advanced HEPA filtration, Dyson air purifiers can tackle indoor air pollution and help improve your well-being at home,'' said Muzaffar Izamuddin, Design Manager, Environmental Care at Dyson. Many doctors are also recommending patients, especially the vulnerable such as the elderly, children and people with respiratory ailments, use air filters at home and avoid stepping out during early mornings and evenings. Dr Rahul Sharma, additional director (pulmonology) at Fortis Hospital in Noida, said,"" HEPA (high-efficiency particulate) filters work well and we recommend them to patients, especially those who are homebound. ""The purifier works in a limited cubic metre of space. While buying a purifier one should check the capacity of how much air it can purify in accordance with the capacity of your home. Another important thing is that there are HEPA filters and HEPA-like filters, which are not as effective as HEPA filters and are also very expensive.""

The meeting was held on Thursday in the wake of unfavourable meteorological conditions anticipated to deteriorate the air quality of the National Capital Region in the coming days. As per the dynamic model and weather/ meteorological forecast, the overall air quality over Delhi is likely to remain in the ‘Severe’/ ‘Severe+’ category from November 3 to 5. The Commission decided to implement Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) - ""Severe+"" Air Quality (DELHI AQI > 450) with immediate effect as a preventative measure. It further noted that it is necessary to avoid further deterioration of overall air quality in the NCR due to unfavourable meteorological conditions with slower wind speed and rising farm fire incidents. This is in addition to the restrictive actions mentioned in Stage I, Stage II and Stage III of GRAP. Stage IV – ‘Severe+’ Air Quality to primarily focus on vehicle restrictions including entry of commercial trucks into Delhi, diesel commercial vehicles for intra-Delhi movements and non—BS VI passenger vans, LMVs in Delhi. Various agencies responsible for implementing measures under GRAP and Pollution Control Boards (PCBs) of NCR and DPCC have also been advised to ensure strict implementation of actions of Stage IV under GRAP during this period. Further, the CAQM appealed to the citizens of NCR to cooperate in implementing GRAP and follow the steps mentioned in the Citizen Charter under GRAP. Following are the measures prescribed under stage IV The Commission also urged children, the elderly and those with respiratory, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or other chronic diseases to avoid outdoor activities and stay indoors, as much as possible. It is pertinent to mention here that the next comprehensive review is expected to be held on November 6 where GRAP measures would be taken based on the air quality forecast and other meteorological parameters.

The share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution jumped to 38 per cent on Thursday. The sudden rise has given birth to a thick layer of pungent smog over the national capital. The increase in stubble burning has kicked off a political slugfest, with Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav on Wednesday saying that there had been a 19 per cent rise in farm fires over 2021 in Punjab and that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had turned the national capital into a gas chamber. Political slugfest ensues Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, in turn, blamed the central government for rising incidents of stubble burning in Punjab and said it should ""resign"" if it cannot control air pollution. Gufran Beig, founder project director, SAFAR, a forecasting agency under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, said, ""The share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution has increased to around 38 per cent which is quite significant."" The air pollution situation is the worst in Noida which falls into the path of emissions being transported from stubble burning, he said. ""Gurugram and Lodhi Road areas which do not fall into this path are the least affected,"" Beig said.  Delhi's air quality slipped back into the ""severe"" zone Thursday morning amid raging farm fires and stagnant conditions at night. The overall air quality index stood at 419 at 9 am. AQI to remain severe till Friday morning ""The overall air quality in Delhi will continue to remain in the severe category till Friday morning. There will be slight improvement afterwards. A major relief is likely on Saturday due to predicted improvement in meteorological conditions -- wind speed and direction,"" Beig said. An AQI (air quality index) of above 400 is considered ""severe"" and can affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing illnesses. According to the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago's (EPIC) Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) released in June, the residents of Delhi stand to lose 10 years of life expectancy due to poor air quality. Punjab reports 3,634 farm fires on Wednesday Punjab had on Wednesday reported 3,634 farm fires, the highest this season so far, though their share in Delhi PM2.5 pollution stood at just 12 per cent due to unfavourable transport-level wind speed. The number of farm fires stood at 1,842 on Tuesday, 2,131 on Monday, 1,761 on Sunday, 1,898 on Saturday and 2,067 on Friday. SAFAR said the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was ""moderate"" at 12 per cent due to unfavourable transport-level wind speed. Transport-level winds blow in the lowest two layers of the atmosphere -- the troposphere and stratosphere -- and carry smoke from farm fires to the national capital region. Farm fires accounted for 14 per cent of the PM2.5 pollution in the national capital on Tuesday, 22 per cent on Monday, 26 per cent on Sunday and 21 per cent on Saturday, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). PM2.5 are fine particles that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter and can travel deep into the respiratory tract, reaching the lungs and entering the bloodstream. The Commission for Air Quality Management had last week said the increased incidents of stubble burning in Punjab this year ""is a matter of serious concern"". Along with unfavourable meteorological conditions, paddy straw burning in adjoining states is a major reason behind the alarming spike in air pollution levels in the national capital in October and November. Farmers burn stubbles to quickly clear off crop residue Farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue before cultivating wheat and vegetables. According to the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), Punjab reported 71,304 farm fires between September 15 and November 30 last year and 83,002 farm fires in the corresponding period in 2020. Last year, the share of farm fires in Delhi's PM 2.5 pollution peaked to 48 per cent on November 7. According to an analysis by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee, people in the national capital breathe the worst air between November 1 and November 15 -- the period when stubble burning peaks. The city records an average PM2.5 concentration of 285 micrograms per cubic metre from November 1 to November 15. PM 2.5 level from 61 to 120 is considered ""moderate to poor"", 121 to 250 is ""very poor"", 251 to 350 is ""severe"" and more than 350 is ""severe plus"".

""I appeal to people if possible work from home and avoid taking out private vehicles. 50% of the pollution is from vehicles. People shouldn't burst crackers,"" Rai told media. The air quality in the national capital continued to remain in the 'very poor' category on Wednesday morning as the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) of the city stood at 354.

The deteriorating air quality in Delhi NCR region remains a problem around this time of the year. It also becomes a contentious issue with various state governments blaming each other for what has now become an annual problem. The burning of agricultural waste in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, according to analysts , is one of the primary reasons for the rising air pollution in the region. ""Stubble burning in Punjab is happening due to Centre as they didn't support Punjab govt, farmers to stop it"" added Gopal Rai, the Environment Minister in the AAP-led Delhi government.

Meanwhile, last week, Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and adjoining areas intensified efforts to ensure enforcement and compliance with its directions after the air quality of the national capital plunged to the ""severe"" category on Friday. Environmentalist Vimlendu Jha told media that severe category AQI is very dangerous for health and it affects even healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases. ""In such circumstances, the school should be closed and outdoor movement should be prohibited because severe category AQI impacts all aspects of life,"" Jha said.

Delhi records second-best air quality in October since 2015: CPCB data Meanwhile, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)’s data showed some better picture in terms of air quality in the month of October. A prolonged spell of rain in early October gave Delhi its second-best air quality in the month since 2015, when the CPCB started maintaining air quality index data. The capital recorded an average air quality index of 210, the best in the month after the average AQI of 173 recorded in October last year. The average AQI stood at 265 in 2020, 234 in 2019, 268 in 2018, 285 in 2017, 271 in 2016 and 264 in 2015. ""Air quality deterioration is seasonal in our country. This is because of the intrusion of dust from neighbouring countries. Low wind speed leads to accumulation of pollutants. Stubble burning, excessive use of vehicles and construction work aid in accumulation of pollutants. Implementation of the Graded Response Action Plan would surely reduce pollution levels,"" said Dipankar Saha, former chief of CPCB's air lab. The city recorded two 'good' air quality days, the highest in eight years, and four 'satisfactory' days in October owing to bountiful rainfall. On October 10, Delhi recorded a 24-hour average AQI of 44, the best since August 31, 2020. The city did not record any 'good' air quality day in October from 2015 to 2020. Delhi logged 128. 2 mm of rainfall this month, the highest for October since 1956. The rainfall suppressed farm fires and kept the air clean till October 15. However, pollution levels rebounded amid unfavourable meteorological conditions in the second half of the month. Emissions from firecrackers and stubble burning pushed the air quality in the 'very poor' category on Diwali. The AQI has largely remained in the 'very poor' zone since then.

Addressing a press conference, Rai said experts have forecast that wind speed and direction will become unfavourable from November 1 which will push the air quality index into the 'severe' category. Therefore, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has directed authorities in NCR to implement curbs, including a ban on construction and demolition activities, under stage three of the Graded Response Plan Action, he said. ""We held a meeting with all construction agencies in the capital and government departments concerned, including PWD, MCD, Railways, DDA, Delhi Pollution Control Committee. We have decided to implement the ban on construction and demolition (C&D) activities in the city,"" Rai said. The government has prepared a strong monitoring system to ensure compliance of the directions. It has set up 586 teams comprising officials of different departments, he said. These teams will monitor the implementation of the ban on C&D activities. Rai also said Anand Vihar and Vivek Vihar have been reporting high pollution levels continuously which could be due to construction work related to Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS). ""Therefore, we have directed the user agency to strictly follow the dust pollution control norms. The government has deployed 15 anti-smog guns in those areas in addition to seven water sprinklers of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi,"" he said. Rai said the government will also deploy fire tenders to sprinkle water at pollution hotspots. There are 521 water sprinklers, 223 anti-smog guns and 150 mobile anti-smog guns operational in Delhi at present, he said. Under stage III, the authorities have been asked to enforce a strict ban on construction and demolition activities in the NCR, except for essential projects and non-polluting activities such as plumbing, carpentry, interior decoration and electrical works. The restrictions on C&D activities will not be applicable on essential projects concerning national security, defence, railways and metro rail among others. The ban on construction and demolition activities covers earthwork for excavation, boring and drilling; fabrication and welding operations; loading and unloading of construction material; transfer of raw material, including fly ash, either manually or through conveyor belts and vehicular movement on unpaved roads. It also bans the operation of batching plants; laying of sewer lines, waterline, drainage work and electric cabling through open trench system; cutting and fixing of tiles, stones and other flooring materials; grinding activities; piling work; water proofing work; road construction and repair works, including paving of sidewalks, pathways and central verges among others. Brick kilns, hot mix plants and stone crushers not operating on clean fuels, and mining and associated activities in the NCR have also been banned. The NCR authorities have also been asked to close down industries not running on approved fuels in industrial areas having PNG infrastructure and supply. In industrial areas not having PNG infrastructure and supply, industries not using approved fuels can operate only for five days a week.

A large number of high-decibel firecrackers thundered throughout Diwali night on Monday as people in Delhi flouted the ban imposed on these by the city government. The capital's air quality index (AQI) stood at 326 at 7 am on Tuesday. The neighbouring cities of Ghaziabad (285), Noida (320), Greater Noida (294), Gurugram (315) and Faridabad (310) reported 'poor' to 'very poor' air quality. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. The relatively better air quality this morning doesn't mean it's good air. Though people burst firecrackers in several parts of Delhi despite a ban on them, the intensity appeared less as compared to the last two years. Farm fires raged across Punjab and Haryana on Monday but the wind speed was moderately unfavourable for the transport of smoke.
Hence, the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi's pollution (around 10 per cent) was also not ""very significant"", said Gufran Beig, chair professor, National Institute of Advanced Studies, Indian Institute of Science.

Emissions from firecrackers and farm fires have contributed significantly to Delhi's PM2. 5 pollution on Diwali over the years. Their share this year was relatively less than previous years. Another important factor behind the largely stable air quality situation was moderate wind speed and warm conditions which did not allow rapid accumulation of pollutants, preventing the air quality from plunging to the 'severe' zone.

Delhi recorded a 24-hour average AQI of 312 at 4 pm on Monday -- the second best for Diwali day in seven years.

Before this, the city recorded an AQI of 281 on Diwali in 2018.

Delhi had recorded an AQI of 382 on Diwali last year, 414 in 2020, 337 in 2019, 319 in 2017, and 431 in 2016, according to Central Pollution Control Board data.

Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai last week said bursting firecrackers in the national capital on Diwali will attract a jail term of up to six months and a fine of Rs 200. Despite the legal deterrent in place, people in many parts of the city, including in south and northwest Delhi, started bursting crackers by dusk. High-intensity firecrackers could be heard going off on the ground or mid-air. And, as the night progressed the intensity of firecrackers increased breaching permissible decibel limits, prompting some to wonder ""if there was any ban at all"". Bursting of firecrackers on Diwali is an age-old tradition, but authorities in Delhi said the decision to restrict it was taken after considering environmental concerns and health hazards associated with it. Delhi's air quality turned ""very poor"" on Monday amid an increase in stubble burning, bursting of firecrackers and moderately unfavourable meteorological conditions which allowed the accumulation of pollutants. The 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 312 was still the second-best for Diwali in seven years. The city recorded an AQI of 281 on Diwali in 2018. Earlier in the day, experts feared that if the volume of firecrackers burst goes up again this year, the air quality is likely to dip further. In case firecrackers are burst like last year, the air quality may plunge to ""severe"" levels on the night of Diwali itself and continue to remain in the ""red"" zone for another day, the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) had earlier predicted. Notwithstanding the ban, people burst firecrackers with impunity in various areas, starting around 6 pm. In south Delhi's East of Kailash, and neighbouring places like Nehru Place and Moolchand, firecrackers going off mid-air could be heard in the evening. Some residents burst crackers in their neighbourhood like every year. In Burari too, many residents burst firecrackers despite widespread dissemination of information about the ban. ""They are educated but still doing this, what will children learn from it,"" said a resident of a colony in Burari. In Laxmi Nagar, Mayur Vihar and Shahdara in east Delhi, the situation was similar. While the intensity in the late evening was lower compared to last year, it rose after 9 pm. ""It was as if the slog overs have started,"" a Laxmi Nagar resident said. Loud thuds of crackers were also reported in southwest Delhi's Munirka area. Bipasha Ghosh, 19, who came to south Delhi's Kailash Hills area from Kolkata, a few days ago, said, ""In my area, it went on past 11 pm. I wonder if there is a ban on bursting firecrackers in Delhi. Also, those doing it are irresponsible and insensitive to the environment and to people who have respiratory problems and other health issues"". Many people complained of itchy skin and a burning sensation in their eyes due to smoke from bursting firecrackers. ""I will not step out tomorrow, I know what the air quality will be tomorrow,"" said Reetu Nandan, a student, who lives in south Delhi. Delhi Environment Minister Rai had earlier said production, storage and sale of firecrackers in the city will be punishable with a fine of up to Rs 5,000 and three years in jail under Section 9B of the Explosives Act. A total of 408 teams had been set up to implement the ban. The Delhi Police set up 210 teams under assistant commissioners of police, while the revenue department set up 165 teams and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee 33 teams. In neighbouring cities of Gurugram and Faridabad too, many people burst firecrackers. The air quality in Ghaziabad (301), Noida (303), Greater Noida (270), Gurugram (325) and Faridabad (256) was reported in the 'poor to very poor' category on Monday. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe"".

The air quality in the national capital and adjoining regions is in the red zone already and the weather department has warned that the Air Quality Index (AQI) is likely to cross the 300 level on Saturday (October 2) thanks to unabated stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Haryana and Punjab. Despite repeated appeals, the Punjab and Haryana governments are finding it tough to control the menace of stubble (parali) burning.

They said the delay could result in farmers racing against time to prepare their fields for the next crop and hence, a sharp increase in farm fires was possible. Though the Centre and the Punjab government have made serious interventions to reduce the number of farm fires this year, officials said the shortening of the window for sowing of Rabi crops could mean more stubble burning in the days to come. Along with unfavourable meteorological conditions, paddy straw burning in Punjab and Haryana is a major reason behind the alarming spike in air pollution levels in the national capital in October and November. Farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue before cultivating wheat and potato. The rains from September 21 to September 25 delayed harvesting in areas like Amritsar and Tarn Taran, where farmers grow potato, peas and other vegetables. The latest spell of rain -- from October 5 to October 11 -- delayed harvesting of paddy in more parts of Punjab and Haryana. ""The delay in paddy harvesting due to rains could lead to clustering of stubble burning incidents in a tight time frame. It is also possible that it could increase the number of farm fires,"" said Vinay Sehgal, principal scientist at Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI). Sehgal said most stubble burning incidents take place after October 15, and the government still has time to sensitise farmers. Dr Mahesh Narang, head of the farm engineering department at the Punjab Agricultural University, said the rains delayed paddy harvesting by around a week in Amritsar, Tarn Taran and other districts where farmers harvest their paddy before October 15 to grow potato and other vegetables. ""The delay in paddy harvesting has further shortened the window to prepare fields for the next crop. So, there is a high probability these farmers may burn the paddy straw instead of managing it through machinery,"" he said. Stubble burning begins around September 20 but the number of fire events remains low till October 12-14. The two prolonged spells of rain suppressed farm fires in Punjab and Haryana and kept air pollution in check in the Delhi-NCR. According to data from the 'Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modelling from Space', nine residue burning events took place on October 8, three on October 9 and four on October 10. The number of farm fires increased to 45 on October 11 and 104 on October 12 as clouds over Punjab and Haryana dissipated. The experts say the farmers' protests in 2020 and the assembly elections last year were major reasons behind the spike in farm fires in the state. The Punjab government has distributed 56,000 additional machines at subsidised rates for in-situ management of stubble this season. A total of 90,422 machines have already been provided since 2018. The PAU professor said a clearer picture would emerge around October 20. ""A spike in stubble burning is also possible around Diwali."" Last year, three factors combined to cause hazardous air quality in the Delhi-NCR -- farm fires, firecrackers and unfavourable meteorology. Diwali is on October 24 this year. According to the IARI, Punjab had reported 71,304 farm fires between September 15 and November 30 last year and 83,002 farm fires in the corresponding period in 2020. Last year, the share of farm fires in Delhi's PM 2. 5 pollution had peaked to 48 per cent on November 7.

But is this part of the year the most polluted? Or is pollution a year-long problem? In either case, what is it that we need to do to minimize its impact? To find out the answers, we spoke with V Deekshith Vara Prasad, Co-Founder & CEO of IIT Chennai-incubated startup and clean tech pioneer AirOk. Excerpts from the interview: There are a few things we can implement to avoid severe problems. A few suggestions like keeping windows and doors closed during early mornings, and later in the evening hours. The use of cooking equipment should also be minimized and one should avoid painting and polishing during this season. If you are nearby a construction site, you may think of covering windows and doors using blankets. Also, it is better to remove carpets and ensure regular cleaning and keep your footwear outside as they bring lots of PM2.5. Also critical in today’s environment scenario that you keep an advanced air purifier at home. What are the different kinds of major pollutants that people should be aware of? Let’s take a closer look at the main pollutants, their origins and the effect they have on our health. This information will allow us to think about the main pollutants in our environment. Particulate matter in the atmosphere with a diameter of fewer than 2.5 micrometres (PM2.5) is the biggest environmental cause of death and illness.PM is a complex mixture of solid and liquid particles that are suspended in the air. PM is a good indicator of air quality, as it is the air pollutant with the greatest capacity to affect human health. It is therefore one of the most widely used indicators of air pollution in the world. Particles can be of different sizes and are measured in microns (μm) in diameter. The most harmful to humans are PM10 (with a diameter of fewer than 10 μm) and PM2.5 (with a diameter of fewer than 2.5 μm). Exposure to these particles can affect both the lungs and the heart.Ozone(O3) is also a major component of urban haze and the third leading cause of global warming, after methane and carbon dioxide. It remains in the atmosphere for anything from a few hours to several days. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) these also one of the main pollutants indoors, Examples of VOCs include paints and lacquers, cleaning supplies, pesticides, building materials and furniture, office equipment such as copiers and printers, craft materials including glues and adhesives, permanent markers and photographic solutions. Apart from these toxic gases are considered major pollutants. Which are the most state-of-the-art air purification technologies currently in India? There may be a few technologies that power the best home air purifiers for dust, but not for a combination of Allergens, Smoke, Pet Dander, Mold Viruses etc. For instance, one of the most common technologies, HEPA, is good in arresting a considerable amount of pollutants but is in no way a complete solution. EGAPA is one-of-its-kind indigenous made-in-India technology that gives a comprehensive 360-degree solution to this real problem that we face almost every minute of the day. Tell us about Claim Your Right to Clean Air campaign. How can people from different walks of life be a part of it? Let’s see a few stats before answering this, The average concentration of PM2.5 in an Indian city is 150 µg/ m 3 of air. The WHO prescribed limit is 25 µg/m3. Globally as per WHO 3.2 million deaths from household air pollution exposure. As a company, we believe this need to be addressed on large scale and that’s the reason, we want everyone to be part of our mission. Claim Your Right to Clean Air is awareness as well as a crowd-funding drive to bolster the cause of clean energy and pure air. The campaign enables individuals to become an active part of the clean air mission through crowdfunding, being carried out by AirOk in association with Tykeinvest. Anyone from anywhere, who feels the need for pure air, can be a part of this campaign. The sum gathered would be used to aid R&D in clean energy. From being an IIT-incubated startup to a clean tech crusader, AirOk has come a long way. Throw some light on the journey and major milestones It’s a journey with a greater cause that kept our team motivated in challenging times, though there are setbacks in establishing a brand and making people aware of air pollution and its effects, Feedback from our customers motivated us to thrive for the best and expand as much as possible, we are not limiting our self we are open to collaborations which serves the greater purpose. In that process, we were happy as we got engaged with major MNCs and appliance companies for promoting our technology through their products to reach a larger audience.

Earlier, Dhaliwal had met Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal regarding the management of the pollution caused by stubble burning in New Delhi, who assured full support to him. Later, he held deliberations with his Delhi's counterpart Gopal Rai. He said this project would be done jointly by the governments of both states. The minister said under the process, Pusa bio-decomposer will be sprayed on the stubble following which the stubble gets mixed in the soil hence the farmers will not need to burn the stubble. The Punjab government has made adequate preparations to prevent the pollution caused by paddy stubble under which various types of equipment are being provided to the farmers on subsidy, awareness drives and surveillance teams have been formed in all districts. Targeting the Union government for turning down cash incentive proposal to farmers for not burning stubble, he called the step anti-farmer, anti-Punjab and said that the state government had proposed to give Rs 2,500 per acre to paddy growers. He said a massive awareness drive would be launched in the rural belt of Punjab comprising officials of the Rural Development and Panchayat to persuade farmers to manage the stubble.

The Delhi government is committed to providing clean air to people and is working on short-term and long-term measures. These measures are being implemented through action plans for summers and winters, he said. Rai said the Delhi government's efforts have led to an increase in the number of ""satisfactory"" (AQ1 51 to 100) and ""moderate"" (AQI 101 to 200) air quality days. He said like the last two years, the Delhi government has prepared a winter action plan to fight air pollution. ""We request you to give us time to prepare a plan to save Delhi from the possible danger of air pollution in the coming months,"" he wrote in the letter to Yadav, who is the Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change. Last year also, Rai wrote several letters to Yadav, calling for emergency meetings to discuss the air pollution issue but did not receive any reply. Delhi's winter action plan focuses on stubble management, dust pollution, vehicular emission, open burning of garbage, industrial pollution, green war room and green Delhi application, pollution hotspots, real-time apportionment study, smog tower, e-waste parks, plantation, eco-farming, public participation, firecrackers and joint action with neighbouring states. The city government has also re-imposed a complete ban on the production, sale and use of all types of firecrackers, including on Diwali, till January 1, a practice it has been following for the last two years.

The revised plan, which is part of a new policy formulated by the CAQM to abate air pollution in Delhi-NCR, focuses on proactive implementation of curbs based on forecasts and restrictions can be imposed up to three days in advance. Earlier, the authorities would implement the measures only after the PM2.5 and PM10 concentration touched a particular threshold.
 
The new plan also entails a ban on BS IV four-wheeler diesel vehicles, barring those engaged in essential services, in Delhi and the bordering districts of NCR if the air quality index (AQI) breaches the 450 mark.
   
The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), notified by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2017, would come into force from October 15 when air pollution levels in the region start worsening. The CAQM has now decided to implement it from October 1, according to a communication sent to state agencies and departments concerned. The GRAP for the National Capital Region (NCR) has now been classified under four different stages of adverse air quality in Delhi: Stage I - 'Poor' (AQI 201-300); Stage II - 'Very Poor' (AQI 301-400); Stage III - 'Severe' (AQI 401-450); and Stage IV - 'Severe Plus' (AQI >450). The revised GRAP recommends a ban on the use of coal and firewood, including in tandoors in hotels, restaurants, open eateries; and on diesel generator sets, except for emergent and essential services under Stage I.
 
If the situation turns ""severe"" (Stage III), authorities will have to enforce a ban on construction and demolition activities in NCR, except on essential projects (like railways, metros, airports, ISBTs, national security/defence-related projects of national importance) and non-polluting activities such as plumbing, carpentry, interior decoration and electrical works.

""State governments in Delhi-NCR may impose restrictions on BS III petrol and BS IV diesel light motor vehicles (four wheelers) under Stage III,"" the policy document read. The measures to be followed in the ""Severe Plus"" category or Stage IV include a ban on the entry of trucks into Delhi, and on the plying of Delhi-registered diesel-run medium goods vehicles and heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) in the national capital except those carrying essential commodities. The use of four-wheeler diesel light motor vehicles, except for BS-VI vehicles and vehicles engaged in essential services, will also be banned in Delhi and the bordering districts of NCR. Stage IV will also entail a ban on industries running on dirty fuels and on construction and demolition activities in linear public projects such as highways, roads, flyovers, over bridges, power transmission and pipelines.
 
""State governments can consider allowing 50 per cent staff to work from home in public, municipal and private offices, and additional emergency measures like closure of educational institutions and the plying of vehicles on odd-even basis etc,"" it said. Actions under Stages II, III and IV will have to be taken at least three days in advance of the air quality index (AQI) reaching to the projected levels of that stage. Earlier, authorities would wait until PM 2.5 or PM 10 concentration touched a particular threshold. Under the 'severe plus' category, agencies waited for PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentrations to stay above 300 and 500 micrograms per cubic metre for 48 hours or more before implementing the measures mandated under GRAP.
 
The sub-committee on GRAP will meet frequently to plan for advance action and issue necessary orders for invoking various provisions of GRAP, based on the prevalent air quality and the AQI forecast to be provided by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) from time to time.

Published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, the study found that the children born to mothers who had used the air cleaners had an average full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) that was 2.8-points higher than the group that did not use an air cleaner during pregnancy. ""These results, combined with evidence from previous studies, strongly implicate air pollution as a threat to brain development,"" said researcher Ryan Allen from Simon Fraser University, in Canada. The team recruited 540 pregnant women in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia to participate in the study. Ulaanbaatar has some of the worst air quality in the world, well-exceeding guidelines set by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The women were less than 18 weeks into their pregnancies and non-smokers who had not previously used air filtering devices in their homes. They were randomly assigned to either the control or intervention group. The intervention group was provided with one or two HEPA filter air cleaners and encouraged to run the air cleaners continuously for the duration of their pregnancies. The air cleaners were removed from the home once the child was born. The researchers later measured the children's FSIQ at four years of age. Children in the intervention group also had significantly greater average verbal comprehension index scores, which is consistent with results from previous observational studies. The research suggests that a child's verbal skills may be particularly sensitive to air pollution exposure.

India saw over 23.5 lakh premature deaths due to pollution of all types- including 16.7 lakh fatalities caused by air pollution- in 2019, the highest among all countries globally, according to a new study published in The Lancet Planetary Health journal. The majority of air pollution related deaths- 9.8 lakh- in India were caused by ambient PM2.5 pollution- tiny pollution particles in the air that are two and one half microns or less in width, the researchers said. Another 6.1 lakh were due to household air pollution, they said. World-wide data based on pollution-related deaths: Globally, pollution of any kind was responsible for nine million deaths in 2019- equivalent to one in six deaths worldwide- and India leads with nearly 2.4 million deaths. Of the nearly 2.4 million deaths in 2019, air pollution accounted for 16.7 lakh deaths - the highest by any country. Further, more than 5 lakh lives were lost in the country due to water pollution, followed by occupational pollution (more than one lakh) and lead exposure (over 2 lakh). Globally, of the nine million pollution - attributable deaths in 2019, air pollution (both household and ambient) remains responsible for the greatest number of deaths at 6.67 million worldwide. The decline in deaths from traditional pollution since 2000 (household air pollution from solid fuels and unsafe water) is most evident in Africa. This can be explained by improvements in water supply and sanitation, antibiotics and treatments, and cleaner fuels. Deaths due to traditional pollution (household air pollution from solid fuels and unsafe water, sanitation, and hand washing) in India have reduced by more than 50 per cent since 2000, the report said. ""The health impacts of pollution remain enormous, and low- and middle-income countries bear the brunt of this burden. Despite its enormous health, social and economic impacts, pollution prevention is largely overlooked in the international development agenda,” said study lead author Richard Fuller, from Global Alliance on Health and Pollution, Geneva, Switzerland. ""Attention and funding has only minimally increased since 2015, despite well-documented increases in public concern about pollution and its health effects,"" Fuller said in a statement. What researchers said about pollution in India? In India, air pollution is most severe in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (northern India), where topography and meteorology concentrate pollution from energy, mobility, industry, agriculture, and other activities, the researchers said. According to the study, burning of biomass in households was the single largest cause of air pollution deaths in India, followed by coal combustion and crop burning. Population-weighted mean exposure to ambient air pollution peaked nationally in India at 95 milligrammes per cubic metre (mg/m3) in 2014, was reduced to 82mg/m3 by 2017, but more recently has been rising slowly again, the researchers said. ""India has developed a range of instruments for tackling air pollution, including a National Clean Air Program, and in 2019 launched a Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region. State Pollution Control Boards have regulatory powers to impose and enforce emissions standards on pollution sources,” the authors of the study noted. Pollution claimed 9 million lives globally in 2019, India tops list with over 23.5 lakh premature deaths, says Lancet study. ""However, India does not have a strong centralised administrative system to drive its air pollution control efforts and consequently improvements in overall air quality have been limited and uneven,"" they said. The report noted that India's PM2.5 pollution remains well above World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines of 10 microgram per cubic metre in 93 per cent area of the country. Take of WHO on pollution: The WHO had recently tightened its health-based global air quality guidelines, lowering the guideline value for PM2∙5 from 10 microgram per cubic metre to 5 microgram per cubic metre. Excess deaths due to pollution have led to economic losses totalling USD 4∙6 trillion in 2019 globally, which is 6.2 per cent of global economic output, it said. Economic losses due to modern forms of pollution- ambient particulate matter air pollution, ozone pollution, lead exposure, occupational carcinogens, gases, fumes- have increased between 2000 and 2019 in India and are now approximately 1 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP), it said. The new report is an update to The Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health. The report states that although the number of deaths from pollution sources associated with extreme poverty (such as indoor air pollution and water pollution) have decreased, these reductions are offset by increased deaths attributable to industrial pollution such as ambient air pollution and chemical pollution. ""Pollution is still the largest existential threat to human and planetary health and jeopardises the sustainability of modern societies,"" said study co-author Professor Philip Landrigan, Director, Global Public Health Program and Global Pollution Observatory at Boston College, US. ""Preventing pollution can also slow climate change- achieving a double benefit for planetary health- and our report calls for a massive, rapid transition away from all fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy,"" Landrigan said. The new report provides updated estimates for the health effects of pollution based on the most recently available 2019 GBD data and methodological updates, as well as an assessment of trends since 2000. Role of water pollution in overall fatalities: The researchers said water pollution was responsible for 1.36 million premature deaths globally. Lead contributed 900,000 premature deaths, followed by toxic occupational hazards at 870,000 deaths. However, this mortality decrease has been offset by a substantial increase in deaths from exposure to industrial pollution - such as ambient air pollution, lead pollution, and other forms of chemical pollution - across all regions over the past 20 years. This is particularly evident in Southeast Asia, where rising levels of industrial pollution are combined with ageing populations and increasing numbers of people exposed. Role of air pollution in fatalities: Ambient air pollution was responsible for 4.5 million deaths in 2019, up from 4.2 million deaths in 2015 and 2.9 million in 2000. Deaths from hazardous chemical pollutants increased from 0.9 million in 2000, to 1.7 million in 2015, to 1.8 million in 2019, with 900,000 deaths attributable to lead pollution in 2019. Overall, deaths from modern pollution have increased by 66 per cent in the past two decades, from an estimated 3.8 million deaths in 2000 to 6.3 million deaths in 2019. Figures on deaths from chemical pollutants are likely to be underestimated as only a small number of manufactured chemicals in commerce have been adequately tested for safety or toxicity, the report noted. Excess deaths due to pollution have also led to economic losses totaling $4.6 trillion in 2019, equating to 6.2 per cent of global economic output. The study also notes pollution's deep inequity, with 92 per cent of pollution-related deaths, and the greatest burden of pollution's economic losses, occurring in low-income and middle-income countries. The study also provided recommendations such as the need for an independent, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC)-style science/policy panel on pollution, alongside increased funding, and improved pollution monitoring and data collection.

Delhi was found to be the most polluted capital in the world for the fourth consecutive year in 2021 and 35 of the 50 cities with the worst air quality were in India, according to a new report. In 2021, none of the cities in India met the prescribed World Health Organization air quality standards of 5 micrograms per cubic meter, stated the World Air Quality Report 2021, prepared by Swiss organization IQAir and released globally on Tuesday. The report, presenting an overview of the state of global air quality in 2021, is based on PM2.5 air quality data from 6,475 cities in 117 countries. The report mentioned that among the most polluted capital cities, Dhaka ranked second after Delhi, followed by N’Djamena in Chad, Dushanbe in Tajikistan and Muscat in Oman. New Delhi saw a 14.6 percent increase in PM2.5 concentrations in 2021 with the levels rising to 96.4 micrograms per cubic meter from 84 micrograms per cubic meter in 2020, the report said. ""India also continues to feature prominently among the most polluted cities with 35 of the top 50 most polluted cities being in this country. India's annual average PM2.5 levels reached 58.1 μg/m3 in 2021, ending a three-year trend of improving air quality."" It stated, ""India's annual PM2.5 averages have returned to pre-quarantine concentrations as measured in 2019. Alarmingly, in 2021, none of the Indian cities met the prescribed WHO standards of 5 μg/m3."" The report also revealed that 48 percent of Indian cities exceeded 50 μg/m3 air quality level which is well over 10 times the WHO guidelines. Commenting on IQAir's recent data, Avinash Chanchal, the Campaign Manager at Greenpeace India said the report is a wake-up call for governments and corporations. ""It is once again highlighting that people are breathing dangerously polluted air. Vehicular emissions are one of the major contributors to urban PM2.5 concentrations. ""With annual vehicle sales in India expected to increase, it is certainly going to impact air quality if corrective measures are not taken in time,"" Chanchal said. He asserted that air pollution has a massive impact on human health and is a major indicator of the accelerating climate catastrophe. He called for switching to cleaner fuels and the promotion of renewable energy for transportation. ""The good thing is we don't need to invest in science to find the solutions to the air pollution crisis. We know the solution and it is readily accessible. PM air pollution is produced by the burning of fuels which is a major contributor to the climate crisis.

The Delhi government spent Rs 10.46 crore on advertisements related to the 'Red Light On, Gaadi Off' campaign to reduce vehicular pollution over the last two years, according to data obtained through an RTI application. Under the campaign launched on October 16, 2020, drivers are encouraged to switch off their vehicles while waiting for the traffic light to turn green. The Delhi government spent Rs 10.46 crore on advertisements related to the campaign in the year 2020-21, according to the reply to an RTI application filed by social activist Amit Gupta. The city government's advertising agency, Shabdarth, said it did not incur any expenses on ads pertaining to the drive in the year 2021-22. ALSO READ: Air pollution: Delhi starts second phase of 'Red Light On, Gadi Off' campaign It added that the government has spent Rs 13.06 crore on ""pollution-related advertisements"" in the financial year 2021-22 so far. As part of the 'Red Light On Gaadi Off' campaign, the environment department deploys civil defence volunteers at major traffic junctions in the city who ensure the commuters kill the engine while waiting at traffic signals, and also hand out pamphlets carrying information on vehicular pollution. The department deployed around 2,500 civil defence volunteers in two shifts of 8 am to 2 pm and 2 pm to 8 pm at 100 traffic junctions in the latest leg of the campaign from October 18 to December 18 last year. The government pays Rs 700 a day to every volunteer, according to officials. Data from the Petroleum Conservation Research Association (PCRA) shows that if people switch off engines at traffic signals, pollution can be cut down by 13-20 per cent.
 
As per government estimates, the transport sector accounts for 28 per cent of the PM2.5 emissions in Delhi. Vehicular contribution also makes up 80 per cent of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide in Delhi's air. A total of 1.33 crore vehicles are registered in Delhi currently. The count of vehicles in the national capital more than doubled to 643 per thousand population in 2019-20 from 317 in 2005-06.

The findings were published in the journal 'Occupational and Environmental Medicine'. The association was strongest for particulate matter, with an average annual raise of 1 ug/m3 linked to a 5 per cent increase in the infection rate. This equates to an extra 294 cases/100,000 people a year, according to the findings, which focus on the inhabitants of one Northern Italian city. While further research is needed to confirm cause and effect, the findings should reinforce efforts to cut air pollution, say the researchers. Northern Italy has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with Lombardy the worst affected region in terms of both cases and deaths. Several reasons have been suggested for this, including different testing strategies and demographics. But estimates from the European Union Environmental Agency show that most of the 3.9 million Europeans residing in areas where air pollution exceeds European limits live in Northern Italy. Recent research has implicated airborne pollution as a risk factor for COVID-19 infection, but study design flaws and data capture only up to mid-2020 have limited the findings, say the researchers. To get around these issues, they looked at long term exposure to airborne pollutants and patterns of COVID-19 infection from the start of the pandemic to March 2021 among the residents of Varese, the eighth-largest city in Lombardy. Among the 81,543 residents as of 31 December 2017, more than 97 per cent were successfully linked to the 2018 annual average exposure levels for the main air pollutants, based on home address. Regional COVID-19 infection data and information on hospital discharge and outpatient drug prescriptions were gathered for 62,848 adults yet to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19 at the end of 2019 until the end of March 2021. Official figures show that only 3.5 per cent of the population in the entire region were fully vaccinated by the end of March 2021. Estimates of annual and seasonal average levels of five airborne pollutants were available for 2018 over an area more than 40 km wide: particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10); nitrogen dioxide (NO2); nitric oxide (NO); and ozone (O3). The average PM2.5 and NO2 values were 12.5 and 20.1 ug/m3, respectively. The corresponding population-weighted average annual exposures in Italy for the same year were 15.5 and 20.1 ug/m3, respectively. Some 4408 new COVID-19 cases, which were registered between 25 February 2020 and March 13, 2021, were included in the study. This equates to a rate of 6005 cases/100,000 population/year. The population density wasn't associated with a heightened risk of infection. But living in a residential care home was associated with a more than 10-fold heightened risk of the infection. Drug treatment for diabetes, high blood pressure, and obstructive airway diseases, as well as a history of stroke, were also associated with, respectively, a 17 per cent, 12 per cent, 17 per cent, and 29 per cent, heightened risk. After accounting for age, gender, and care home residency, plus concurrent long term conditions, averages, both PM2.5 and PM10 were significantly associated with an increased COVID-19 infection rate. Every 1 ug/m3 increase in long term exposure to PM2.5 was associated with a 5 per cent increase in the number of new cases of COVID-19 infection, equivalent to 294 extra cases per 100,000 of the population/year. Applying seasonal rather than annual averages yielded similar results, and these findings were confirmed in further analyses that excluded care home residents and further adjusted for local levels of deprivation and use of public transport. Similar findings were observed for PM10, NO2 and NO. The observed associations were even more noticeable among older age groups, indicating a stronger effect of pollutants on the COVID-19 infection rate among 55-64 and 65-74-year-olds, suggest the researchers. This is an observational study, and as such, can't establish cause. And although the researchers considered various potentially influential factors, they weren't able to account for mobility, social interaction, humidity, temperature and certain underlying conditions, such as mental ill-health and kidney disease. Long term exposure to air pollution heightens the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases through persistent inflammation and compromised immunity. These same pathways may therefore be involved in the link between air pollution and higher COVID-19 infection rates, suggest the researchers. ""Our findings provide the first solid empirical evidence for the hypothesised pathway linking long-term exposure to air pollution with the incidence of COVID-19 and deserve future generalisation in different contexts. Meanwhile, government efforts to further reduce air pollution levels can help to mitigate the public health burden of COVID-19,"" they conclude.

""The committee's report states measures that have been taken. So far as construction activities have been taken it's been stated that a decision will be taken tomorrow. We will list the matter in the first week of February.

At the outset, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the bench that operation of industrial processes related to milk, dairy processing, manufacture of drugs, life-saving medicines and medical equipment has been permitted. He said some industries were permitted for eight hours, some industries said their nature of industries is such that eight hours is not sufficient. ""We have asked them to have a continuous process but five days not seven days. And we have staggered industries so they don't function on the same days,"" Mehta said. ""Thermal power plants that are closed will remain shut but more will not be closed. Decision on construction activities will be taken tomorrow. Hospital constructions are permitted, while trucks, etc. continue to be banned,"" he submitted. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the petitioners in the case, said only short term measures have been proposed and the problem of air pollution, long term permanent measures are needed. ""These (submitted by SG) are short term measures. I've some suggestions. Some permanent solution has to be found,"" Singh said. The bench, however, asked him to submit suggestions which would be considered by an expert group constituted by the commission. The commission has told the top court that milk and dairy processing units, ,medicines, drugs and life-saving equipment industries have been allowed to resume full time operations. Besides these, paper and pulp processing industries have been allowed to work five times a week while paddy, rice industries and textile, garment units have been permitted to work five days a week. The commission further told the apex court that power plants have been permitted to operate keeping in view the demand for power. The ban on construction activities, however, will continue and schools will also continue to function through online mode for the time being which will be reviewed again on December 17. The apex court had earlier taken note of slight improvement in air pollution levels in Delhi-NCR and permitted the commission on air quality management to take a decision on various representations seeking easing of curbs, like ban on construction activities, within a week. On December 3, the bench had directed the Centre and the NCR states to implement the panel's order to curb pollution and sought a proposal to ensure switching over of all industrial units to PNG or cleaner fuel in a time-bound manner or face closure. The bench had also rued that some news reports tried to ""portray  the court as a ""villain"" that wanted to close down schools in Delhi-NCR. It had taken note of the commission's proposal that industrial operations in the NCR, where gas is not available and the industrial unit is not running on PNG or cleaner fuels, shall be allowed to operate only up to eight hours a day during weekdays and shall remain closed during Saturdays and Sundays. Let a proposal to switch over all the industrial units to PNG or cleaner fuels in a time-bound manner, failing which such units should be closed down, be also placed on record,  it had ordered. The commission had said that a five-member enforcement task force has been set up to contain air pollution in Delhi and NCR, and 40 squads would monitor the implementation of measures suggested by it to deal with pollution. The panel had also said that 17 flying squads have been set up to ensure the implementation of various measures mandated by the court which would be raised to 40 within 24 hours.

With pollution levels reaching alarming levels in the national capital, ophthalmologists have observed a sharp rise in the number of patients suffering from eye problems including allergy, burning and itching. Eyes are very vulnerable to air pollution. Both chronic, long-lasting and short-term exposure is harmful; exposure to a high dose of toxic air pollutants can result in symptoms of conjunctivitis or eye dryness even on the same day. Tear film, cornea, and conjunctiva have constant contact with ambient air, so toxins that it contains can directly affect them and interfere with its functions. “We are observing an increase in number of patients coming to us with complains of redness, itching, watering in the eyes. Patients with pre-existing dry eyes are experiencing exacerbation due to high pollution,” Deepshikha Sharma, CEO, Sharp Sight Eye Hospitals said. She pointed out that more than the elderly, it is children or those aged between 20 and 40 who are at greater risk of eye-related problems caused by pollution. Sharma said that opthalmologists were observing almost increase of 30-35 per cent in the number of patients coming with eye-related problems. PM2.5 and other pollutants were also associated with changes in the structure of people’s retinas, she added. In those wearing contact lenses eye irritation as a result of air pollution is more intensified. Association between bad air quality and development of conjunctivitis and dry eye syndrome is most broadly examined and reported. To best avoid damage to your eyes, it is recommended that you wear contact lenses prescribed to you by your optician, and that you are following their advice and what is detailed in the manufacturer’s guidelines. With Delhi air quality at a hazardous level, try to stay indoors if the pollution level is high. If out, wear masks, spectacles, sunglasses to stop the particulates to enter inside your eyes. If the pollutants have entered inside your eye, avoid rubbing your eyes and splash them with water immediately. Pollution can cause excessive dryness and soreness if the condition persists rush to an ophthalmologist for quick diagnosis and recommended treatment for your eyes.

""Do you want us to ban Pakistan’s industries,"" Chief Justice of India NV Ramana asked senior advocate Ranjit Kumar who appeared for the Uttar Pradesh government. Kumar told the court that industries based in Uttar Pradesh have no role in Delhi's poor air quality. ""UP is on down wind, air is mostly coming from Pakistan,"" Kumar argued. The UP government also questioned the rationale behind the order to close industries stating that such a step will affect the sugarcane and dairy industries.

A special bench headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana said the Aam Aadmi Party government had made various assurances such as work from home, lockdown, and closure of schools and colleges in the previous hearings. However, despite these assurances, the children were are going to school while elders are working from home.

A Bench of Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Surya Kant directed the Centre to respond to issues related to construction activities including the Central Vista project under its domain. Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the petitioner, that construction activities for big projects like the Central Vista are going on in full swing and such a project cannot be ""more important than the lives of citizens"". To this, the Bench observed, ""The question is how we are struggling as to how to control the pollution and whether it is Central Vista or polluting industries or the states... Do you think that we do not know anything? We also know everything. Don't flag certain issues which ultimately lead to a situation where the main issue is diverted.""

""Recently, the Delhi government had removed restrictions from construction and demolition activities. All the construction agencies have also been advised to stick to the 14 point-guidelines. We have deployed 585 teams to keep a check at such sites to curb the dust pollution. Those found violating the norms will be penalized and subjected to strict action without any notice whatsoever,"" the minister added. The Delhi government on Monday lifted the ban on construction activities after the marginal improvement in the national capital's air quality. On November 21, all schools in the national capital were shut down until further orders of the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas, owing to the rising levels of air pollution in the city. ""Schools, colleges, libraries, and other educational institutions will also be reopened from November 29 onwards,"" Rai said, adding that government offices will also be reopened from Monday and everyone is advised to use the public mode of transport. Since Diwali, the AQI of the national capital continued to hover around the upper end of the 'very poor' or 'severe' category. The change in wind direction, stubble burning, and bursting of firecrackers were cited to be the reason behind worsened air quality. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', then 401 and between 500 is considered 'severe'. Air quality visibly improved in Delhi after strong surface winds swept through the city on Sunday with today's AQI being recorded at 280 by the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR).

In Delhi, air quality has deteriorated to dangerous levels, causing serious health problems such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, dyspnea, nausea, and eye burning. Preventive steps, such as avoiding leaving the house during pollution, utilising air purifiers at home, staying hydrated, and eating immunity-boosting foods, are all essential. Mithila singh (name changed), a college student from Karol Bagh, Delhi, was fine and going about her usual routine when she had an asthma attack two to three days ago. Symptoms such as heaviness in the chest and breathing problems were caused by the low air quality. Her family drove her to our hospital right away. Bronchodilators were given to her right away to help her breathe. The patient is currently on medicine and appears to be in good health. Rest and frequent check-ups have been recommended for her. The haze makes it difficult for many patients who already have respiratory difficulties to breathe. Similarly, several new patients have complained of shortness of breath, cough, throat irritation, and dizziness owing to the pollution. ""The fog and toxins mix together and generate smog, which is dangerous for the health,"" Dr Vipul Rustgi, MBBS MD Medicine, Consultant physician and Diabetologist, Apollo Spectra, Delhi, remarked. Sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter, which are generated by cars and crackers, mix with fog to form smog, which is a dense layer in the atmosphere. Smog causes respiratory ailments, dyspnea, nausea, and possibly cancer, resulting in a higher morbidity rate. Those suffering from asthma, which causes inflamed airways, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which causes restricted airflow from the lungs, are also admitted to the ICU. Until now, many people have complained of smog-related concerns, particularly breathing difficulties. In comparison to the previous year, the number of similar cases is up. The elderly are more aware of it. As a result of air pollution, children's coughing and running nose have become prevalent."" ""Toxic air causes cough, cold, throat discomfort, and the spread of viral illnesses in persons of all ages,"" Dr Rustgi stated. Smog affects not only one's lungs but also one's cardiovascular system. Smog can also result in serious car accidents. It's impossible to estimate the actual number of patients affected, but we are seeing an increase in smog-related illnesses. ""To reduce the health difficulties caused by smog, the elderly, children, pregnant women, and people with lung diseases should avoid outdoor activities when there is excessive pollution,"" Dr Rustgi continued. Keep the windows and doors closed and use an air purifier to flush out the harmful air pollutants and filter the air, do not go out in heavy traffic, stay hydrated to flush out toxins from the body, avoid going to parties and functions in open ground, say No to oily food that leads to stress in the body while dealing with smog. Smog can cause throat infections, so eat vitamin C-rich foods such as lemons, melons, grapes, papaya, kiwis, peas, cauliflower, cabbage, okra, red bell peppers, broccoli, seeds, and inhale steam on a daily basis. Keep your allergy kit stocked with the necessary medications, inhalers, and nebulizers, and increase your tree planting at home."" ""Existing patients with lung or heart conditions should stock up on medications, keep an inhaler on hand, and pay attention to symptoms such as wheezing and fatigue."" ""Long-term exposure to the chemicals can lead to strokes, ischemic heart disease, and possibly lung cancer,"" Dr Rustgi concluded.

If any agency is found violating dust control norms, the Delhi govt will stop work and impose a penalty without notice, Rai added. The decision comes after a high-level meeting to review the curbs imposed to contain high pollution levels in the city. Speaking on the reopening of schools, work from home for Delhi govt staff and the ban on entry of trucks in the national capital, Rai said a decision in this regard will be made later. ""Will take call on reopening of schools, work from home for Delhi govt staff, truck entry on Nov 24,"" Gopal Rai said today. The environment minister also said 1,000 private CNG-operated buses have been hired, which will have 'Prayavaran Bus Sewa' written on them. The Delhi government on Sunday night extended the ban on the entry of trucks carrying non-essential items and work-from-home for its employees till November 26 to combat air pollution and minimise its health effects. In an order, the Delhi government had imposed a blanket ban on the construction and demolition activities in the national capital, in the wake of deteriorating air quality and to curb pollution caused by dust. A construction workers' body had also moved the Supreme Court seeking ex-gratia relief schemes for daily workers who will suffer loss of income due to the sudden complete ban. The plea said the ban on construction without due notice and publicity leaves the workers completely insecure and unaware, making them ideal fodder for harassment by the implementing agencies. Delhi's air quality improves Meanwhile, strong surface winds brought some relief from high pollution levels in Delhi and improved visibility on Monday morning. The air quality index of the city stood at 307, which falls in the very poor category. However, it was down from 349 the previous day. The air quality index of Gurugram, Greater Noida, Faridabad and Noida stood at 318, 213, 326 and 268 respectively. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered good, 51 and 100 satisfactory, 101 and 200 moderate, 201 and 300 poor, 301 and 400 very poor, and 401 and 500 severe. Winds gusting up to 20 kmph swept through the city, dispersing pollutants partially and improving visibility. The minimum temperature on Monday was recorded at 12 degrees Celsius, normal for this time of the year.

264,IndiaTV News,https://www.indiatvnews.com/health/precautions-and-suggestions-by-health-experts-to-counter-indoor-air-pollution-745493,Precautions and suggestions by health experts to counter indoor air pollution,"Published : Nov 17, 2021 17:09 IST, Updated : Nov 17, 2021 17:09 IST","Representative image Whenever we talk about 'air pollution', it is usually what goes on outside buildings and dwellings. However, indoor air pollution is just as lethal as the outdoor variety. Indoor, or household, air pollution caused 64 per cent fewer deaths in the last two decades (2000-2019) in India, according to a report by interdisciplinary journal 'Lancelot Planetary Health'. According to the Environment Protection Act, 1986, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2-5 times higher than outdoor levels. In some cases, these levels can exceed the outdoor levels of the same pollutants 100 times. Many air pollutants that are considered important in ambient (outdoor) air, are also found, sometimes at higher levels, in indoor air. People spend, on average, 65 per cent of their time inside their homes. A growing body of research suggests that indoor air pollution can be much more concentrated than pollution outside. Let's take a look at what precautions and suggestions health experts and industry leaders shared below to counter indoor air pollution which remains largely unregulated. Dr. Akshay Budhraja, Pulmonologist, Aakash Healthcare, Dwarka states that ""Indoor air is not always worse than outdoor. It depends on how aware you are about it and how to preserve indoor air quality at home & offices. Sometimes indoor concentration of some pollutants is 4-5 times higher than outside. The indoor air quality worsens by both the smog present outside and because of the pollutants generated inside like combustion sources (gas stove, cooking, fire place, cigarette smoking), molds, pet dander, radon, pesticides, volatile organic compounds present in paint, carpets and upholsteries. People tend to keep the windows open during early morning hours when the level of smog is highest. Many people smoke inside the house. Sometimes people do not use exhausts, chimneys and there is poor ventilation of the rooms."" Adding, ""Many people experience ""sick building syndrome"" that is experiencing respiratory symptoms when inside the building which resolves once the person is out of that particular building. That is caused by the pollutants/allergens present inside the building. Indoor pollutants can cause respiratory symptoms like asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, itching in eyes, nose, throat, headache, heart diseases, poor sleep quality etc."" He advises, ""Keep your windows closed during early morning and later evening hours. Use chimneys and exhausts wherever necessary. Minimise the use of chemicals. Avoid furniture polishing when at home. Keep your home and surroundings clean by: keeping your footwears outside as they bring lots of soil and dust drycleaning/washing of bed covers, quilts, curtains at regular intervals. Use indoor plants, air purifiers."" Dr. Shuchin Bajaj, Internal Medicine ( Founder Director), Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals states, ""Smoke from cooking and smoking tobacco comprise a large chunk of the indoor air pollution, which, when mixed with ambient pollutants, increase the amount of ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM) and carbon monoxide (CO). The wind speed in winters slows down which compels the pollutants to remain within the lower parts of the atmosphere, as a result, we inhale more pollutants than any other time of the year."" ""Air temperature also has a profound effect on risk of heart attack - the risk increases when the temperature drops to zero degrees C or below - windy, short days of sunshine, and lower air pressure are linked to increased risk. The increase in heart attack risk could be due to weather's effect on the circulatory system. Cold and wind cause the body to contract the blood vessels of the skin to preserve temperature and energy. This causes the heart to pump more due to higher resistance, which increases the stress on the heart and may trigger a heart attack."" Dr Arunesh Kumar, HOD & Senior Consultant - Pulmonology, Paras Hospitals, Gurugram reiterates, ""The air that we breathe inside our homes or offices may be more hazardous than the air outside. This is especially so during the cold winter months when the doors and windows are kept closely shut. Indoor air pollution has been linked to a wide variety of adverse health effects, including headaches, frequent colds and sore throats, respiratory problems, chronic cough, eye irritation, lethargy, skin rashes, dizziness and memory lapses. To keep the air inside the house or office pollutant free, it is important to use aerosol free products, instead of scented cleaning products. Also, it is important to clean the duct and filters regularly to make sure you get filtered clean air and use natural air purifiers like indoor plants as they remove formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethane from the air and replace it with oxygen. One can even install air purifiers inside the house to get rid of indoor air quality problems."" Himanshu Agarwal, CEO, Magneto CleanTech, a company which develops central air purification systems and technologies to tackle the problem of poor indoor air quality in developing nations believes, ""Although pollution has been a longstanding subject of public debate, there is a dire need to shift the focus of this conversation from outdoor to indoor air pollution, where people have a much higher exposure. We are all responsible for pollution with our lifestyle and consumption habits particularly within our homes, where self-created air pollution can lead to 10x worse indoor air quality than outdoors."" ""The authorities have in the recent past become visibly environmentally sensitive and energy-efficient with their projects and initiatives. We as a civil society must also educate ourselves and others on the imperative of tackling indoor air pollution with a sense of urgency. Air pollution is a long-haul challenge and not a seasonal or regional issue. Remember, China (and many others) is still struggling with pollution despite having taken stringent measures for many years now. Furthermore, in these times of the pandemic, the connection between pollution and air borne infections must not be lost sight of. Air Pollution has all kinds of respiratory, cardiac, mental and immune impacts on humans, especially children. However, with technological advancements, one can ensure complete protection from air pollution and airborne viruses for their loved ones. It is time we individually treat air pollution as much and where it matters the most - indoors.""

Hearing the case, Justice Surya Kant today said those sitting in 5 stars in Delhi keep blaming farmers for rising air pollution in the national capital. ""What it's seeing is the plight of farmers. People sitting in Delhi in 5, 7-star hotels criticise how they contribute 4, 30, or 40 per cent to pollution. Have you seen their (farmers) earning per landholding? CJI says we ignore the fact that firecrackers are burning despite the ban?"" the Supreme Court said today. The top court also responded to the submission of senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the Delhi government, that stubble burning was one of the contributors of the air pollution which needs to be addressed and referred to the Centre's figures on the issue. Debates on TV news channels are causing more pollution than anybody with statements made in the court being taken out of context, the Supreme Court said today. A bench headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana said everyone has their own agenda and statements are taken out of context in these debates. ""You want to use some issue, make us observe and then make it controversial, and then only blame games will remain..,"" observed the bench also comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and Surya Kant. ""Debates on TV are creating more pollution than anybody. They don't understand what is happening and what is the issue. Statements are taken out of context. Everyone has their own agenda. We can't help and we can't control. We are focussing on working out the solution,"" it said. ""I watched some irresponsible and nasty utterances on TV media against me that I misled the court on the question of stubble burning by showing that its contribution is only 4 to 7 per cent. Let me clarify,"" the court said. At the beginning of the hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta submitted before a bench headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana, that the Centre did not mislead the court on the exact contribution of stubble burning, 4 per cent in winters and 7 per cent in summers, and data in the report was on an annual average basis. Mehta said some nasty statements were made in TV studios in connection with figures related to the stubble burning. The bench, also comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and Surya Kant, however, made it clear that it has not been misled. The bench said: ""We were not misled at all. You said 10 per cent but it was pointed out in the affidavit that it was 30 to 40 per cent (in the annexure)..."" The Chief Justice said, ""These kinds of criticisms keep happening. Our conscience is clear and we work for public interest..."" He further added that ""Debates on TV are creating more pollution than everyone else...We must focus on working out a resolution."" Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the Delhi government, argued on Centre's figures on crop stubble burning by farmers, in connection with air pollution in the national capital. Singhvi added that the Centre's figures on stubble burning contribution to the air pollution, says that it varies from 0 to 58 per cent. He added, ""Possibly Mr. Mehta has taken a four- or six-month average (to arrive at the annual figures)."" The Chief Justice said the top court is focussing on steps to bring down the air pollution, and told Singhvi not to raise the stubble burning issue again and again, and rather focus on steps the Delhi government proposes to curb air pollution. Singhvi said: ""We are not blaming anyone... both are Centre's figures."" The bench reiterated that it is not inclined to penalise the farmers and the state governments should persuade them to stop stubble burning. The bench pointed out that nobody understands the plight of the farmers. The top court is hearing a case filed by a 17-year-old Delhi student relating to air pollution in Delhi and adjoining areas due to stubble burning.

Blanket ban on construction activities, without identifying and excluding the ones which do not contribute towards air pollution is ""irrational, arbitrary and whimsical"", said the petition filed by National Campaign Committee for Central Legislation on Construction Labour. It alleged that despite having a dedicated corpus of Rs 2,700 crore, the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi has failed to frame any ex-gratia relief scheme for the building workers for the periods when they have to give up their work due to ""sudden absolute blanket bans"". ""The Government of NCT of Delhi and Government of Haryana have failed to assess and identify the pollution causing activities. It is submitted that ideally, the ban ought to be limited to activities such as demolition and excavation only. Such absolute blanket bans unnecessarily trample upon rights and livelihoods of lakhs of building workers, without contributing even an iota towards reducing air pollution,"" the plea said. The plea said the ban on construction without due notice and publicity leaves the workers completely insecure and unaware, making them ideal fodder for harassment by the implementing agencies. ""It is also noteworthy that when 'odd-even scheme' is to be implemented for vehicular traffic, the Government of NCT of Delhi issues advertisements for months in advance in order to enable the citizens to prepare their commuting plans for the said period, whereas, ban on construction sector, which employs the largest number of workers in Delhi, is imposed without any notice whatsoever,"" the plea said. ""The drastic indefinite nature of such bans forces the building workers and petty contractors to disobey, since, due to lack of clarity the workers and petty contractors are unable to plan and identify their sources of income for the said periods,"" it added.

Delhi-NCR recorded its air quality in the very poor category on Wednesday morning and no major improvement is likely until Sunday, authorities said. The minimum temperature in the capital dropped to 9.6 degrees Celsius, three notches below normal and the lowest this season so far. The maximum is likely to settle around 27 degrees Celsius, the India Meteorological Department said. The city recorded its air quality index at 389 at 9 am. It had slipped into the severe zone on Tuesday and was recorded at 403 at 4 pm. Air quality index in Faridabad (350), Ghaziabad (368), Greater Noida (358), Gurugram (354) and Noida (369) also recorded their air quality in very poor category. V K Soni of the IMD on Tuesday told the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) that lower ventilation index due to low temperatures and calm wind conditions is predicted between Wednesday and Sunday, which is unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants. The air quality is likely to improve Sunday onwards due to relatively strong winds, he said. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor SAFAR has said the intrusion of stubble burning-related pollutants into Delhi is not likely on Wednesday and Thursday as the transport level wind direction is easterly. Ahead of a Supreme Court hearing on the air pollution issue, the CAQM late Tuesday night directed that schools, colleges and educational institutions in the National Capital Region will remain closed until further orders, allowing only online mode of education. It also said that only five of the 11 thermal power plants located within 300 km radius of Delhi -- NTPC, Jhajjar; Mahatma Gandhi TPS, CLP Jhajjar; Panipat TPS, HPGCL; Nabha Power Ltd. TPS, Rajpura and Talwandi Sabo TPS, Mansa -- will remain operational till November 30. The commission directed Delhi and the NCR states to stop construction and demolition activities in the region till November 21, barring railway services/railway stations, metro rail corporation services, including stations, airports and inter-state bus terminals (ISBTS) and national security/defence-related activities/ projects of national importance subject to strict compliance of the C&D Waste Management Rules and dust control norms. NCR state governments have been directed to allow work from home (WFH) for at least 50 percent of their staff in offices in NCR till Sunday and encourage private establishments to follow suit. Trucks carrying non-essential items have been banned from entering Delhi till Sunday. ""All industries in NCR still using unapproved fuels shall be closed by respective governments with immediate effect... NCR States and GNCTD shall enforce a strict ban on use of DG sets, except for emergency services,"" the panel said.

The Centre on Wednesday proposed a slew of measures in the Supreme Court including a ban on entry of all trucks in the national capital except vehicles carrying essential goods, shutting of schools and 50 per cent attendance in offices of GNCTD to reduce air pollution in Delhi-NCR. Taking note of the Centre's submissions, the Supreme Court directed Delhi and NCR states to comply with these decisions which were taken at Tuesday's meeting to curb air pollution. A bench headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana posted the matter for hearing on November 24 after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta submitted that various steps are being taken and urged the top court not to pass any extreme orders. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told a bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana that a meeting of chief secretaries of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi along with others was held on Tuesday. The issue regarding work from home for central government officers was considered but the total vehicles used for central government officers is not huge. ""So rather than implementing work from home we have issued an advisory for pooling and sharing of vehicles,"" Mehta told the bench also comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant. The Centre suggested 50 per cent attendance in offices of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD). Delhi-NCR recorded its air quality in the very poor category on Wednesday morning and no major improvement is likely until Sunday, authorities said. The apex court was hearing a plea filed by environmental activist Aditya Dubey and law student Aman Banka, who sought directions to provide stubble-removing machines to small and marginal farmers for free. SC to hear the matter on air pollution next Wednesday. CJI observes ""Bureaucracy has gone into inertia and they don't want to do anything. Like using sprinklers or water buckets we have to say, this is the attitude of the executive,"" Supreme Court suggests that Central government officers living in government colonies travel in public transport. SC asks SG about how many vehicles are there and how are Central government officials traveling; says ""You don't need all 100 officers in the office, you can instead call 50 officers. There are several government localities, can't they travel in public transport? SG says WFH in a state like Delhi will have an impact in Delhi but if we (Central employees) go WFH, it'll have pan-India ramifications. Can the minimum impact it has on pollution outweigh the impact it will have on Pan India functioning; thus we've suggested car-pooling, SG adds You all say vehicle is the main cause, but gas guzzlers, hi-fi cars run on Delhi roads. Who'll encourage them to stop this? Delhi says no point in banning vehicles or have WFH if not implemented in neighboring states. We thought Commission will give us steps to stop this, SC says Solicitor General tells Supreme Court that meteorological scientists were also there in the emergency meeting and according to them the wind flow will be there after November 21; says ""Would this court not consider waiting till Nov 21 before implementing harsh measures."" CJI NV Ramana says that there has to be some responsibility, not everything can be done through judicial order; asks the reason for the burning of firecrackers in Delhi in past 10 days after Diwali. On what it has done for farmers on stubble burning, Haryana government tells Supreme Court that Chief Secretary and District Magistrates are taking stock of the situation so that no stubble burning takes place in these (next) two weeks. Counsel appearing for Punjab government tells Supreme Court the State doesn't fall under Delhi-NCR region but has taken measures (for stubble burning). Haryana government tells Supreme Court that it has implemented whatever was suggested by the Commission and that whatever is ordered will be followed. On whether it is possible for it to increase the supply of CNG buses, Delhi govt informs SC that it can increase metro and bus frequencies; requests (SC) to order work from home, ban in vehicles in periphery (adjoining states) too, since no point of such ban only in Delhi. On SC asking Delhi govt over steps to curb air pollution; Delhi government says construction sites are being vigorously looked at with day and night patrolling and anti smog guns have been installed. Anti-dust campaign being organised as well. SC says what it's seeing is the plight of farmers. People sitting in Delhi in 5, 7-star hotels criticise how they contribute 4, 30 or 40% to pollution. Have you seen their (farmers) earning per landholding?CJI says we ignore the fact that firecrackers are burning despite the ban? Delhi government tells Supreme Court that 90% of what the Centre proposed has been done by Delhi government and the suggestions are modelled on Delhi government's measures. Debates on TV are creating more pollution than everybody. They don’t understand, statements are taken out of context.  Everyone has their own agenda, says Supreme Court. Supreme Court tells Singhvi that its focus is pollution, and he is raising issues that are not relevant. We have taken care of this and said in our order to request farmers to not be involved in stubble burning for two weeks. Singhvi tells Supreme Court that the figures on stubble burning would be much higher in November and asks Supreme Court to not ignore them. Delhi government says source-based breakup of contribution to pollution is yet to be done. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi appearing for Delhi Govt tells Supreme Court that if stubble burning is 3-4%, it need not be addressed. We want to say it is a cause. The Commission also directed all NCR States to close all schools, colleges, and educational institutions and to hold classes via online mode until further orders, Solicitor General tells Supreme Court. Solicitor General tells Supreme Court that the Commission for air quality management for Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas meeting was held and all Chief Secretaries of NCR states and Central ministries senior officials and certain mandatory directions were issued to states. SG Tushar Mehta tells SC that there were nasty appearances against him in media that he misled Court on stubble burning. Court says it wasn't misled & such criticism is bound to happen in public offices. ""We 're clear, our conscience is clear, forget about all this,"" CJI tells SG The Centre has proposed in affidavit before Supreme Court on issue of pollution that all schools in Delhi to remain shut, online classes be allowed. Only five of the 11 thermal power plants located within 300 km radius of Delhi -- NTPC, Jhajjar; Mahatma Gandhi TPS, CLP Jhajjar; Panipat TPS, HPGCL; Nabha Power Ltd. TPS, Rajpura and Talwandi Sabo TPS, Mansa -- will remain operational till November 30.

It had slipped into the severe zone on Tuesday and was recorded at 403 at 4 pm. Trucks carrying non-essential items have been banned from entering Delhi till Sunday. The Centre points out directives issued by Commission for Air Quality Management for Delhi-NCR & adjoining areas that included ban on entry of trucks in Delhi till Nov 21 except trucks carrying essential commodities, closure of thermal plants, ban on construction. Centre tells Supreme Court, through an affidavit, that number of vehicles used by Central government is a minuscule fraction of the total vehicles in the national capital and stopping their plying would not make much impact towards improving the air quality of Delhi. The Centre has expressed unwillingness before the Supreme Court to ask its employees to work from home and instead it has advised its employees in Delhi to resort to carpooling to reduce the number of vehicles used by them for commuting. The Commission of Air Quality Management has suggested NCR state governments to allow work from home (WFH) for at least 50 per cent of their staff in offices in NCR till Sunday and encourage private establishments to follow suit. CAQM also directed Delhi and the NCR states to stop construction and demolition activities in the region till November 21, barring railway services/railway stations, metro rail corporation services, including stations, airports and inter-state bus terminals (ISBTS) and national security/defence-related activities/ projects of national importance subject to strict compliance of the C&D Waste Management Rules and dust control norms.

Instead of making Delhi a world class city as he promised, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has turned it into a ""smog city"", the BJP claimed Tuesday, attacking the AAP government over air pollution in the national capital. ""If Kejriwal is unable to perform, he should immediately resign,"" Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta told a joint press conference with Leader of Opposition in Vidhan Sabha Ramvir Bidhuri. Gupta said that rising pollution level in Delhi is ""the biggest failure"" of the Kejriwal government. ""Instead of making Delhi a world class city as he claimed, Kejriwal has made it a smog city."" The people of Delhi feel quite ""helpless"" now as pollution level is alarming and many are falling ill but Kejriwal and his Aam Aadmi Party are busy in political tourism, Gupta blamed. AAP leaders including Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia have been visiting poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa and Uttarakhand in recent months, even as the city grapples with hazardous levels of air pollution post Diwali. ""The pollution level is so bad in the national capital that even the Supreme Court took it up seriously and admonished the Kejriwal government in no uncertain terms,"" Gupta said. ""Kejriwal is himself busy on political tourism in Uttarakhand, Goa and Punjab while leaving Delhiites to breathe in poisonous air,"" he said. The AAP blames crop stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana for problem in Delhi but the air quality index there is better compared to Delhi, Gupta claimed. ""About two days back, Karnal and Panipat in Haryana had AQI of 157 and 136 respectively while in Ludhiana and Patiala in Punjab it was 148 and 163 respectively whereas in Delhi it was 720. This makes it clear Haryana and Punjab are just lame excuses,"" he said. Bidhuri said the BJP has insisted stubble-burning is not the main reason for pollution. ""There are three other reasons -- poor public transport system, dust particles on roads and emission from industrial units. They are major contributors to air pollution in Delhi,"" he claimed.

The Supreme Court on Monday reprimanded the Centre and the states, especially the Delhi government for their failure to reign in air pollution that had reached hazardous levels last week and now hovering on 'severe' and 'very poor' level. ""CAQM has invited IGs of police from Punjab and Haryana too. The meeting will discuss what all can be done as emergency measures to control air pollution,"" said a source. CAQM is a dedicated Commission - under the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) looking at the air quality of Delhi and NCR's districts of Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh taking an air shed approach (just like watershed, air shed is the geographic area wherein meteorological factors influence the air quality within that area) and therefore, CAQM can and has summoned Punjab too owing to the multiple farm fires from the state lending air pollutants that travel to Delhi. Said an official from Punjab that there have been 6,600 cases of red entry (entry into revenue records) against the farmers indulging in stubble burning in that state. The Tuesday morning meeting is likely to discuss this issue further, an official said, adding, ""There is a need to increase punitive measures in Delhi and other districts of NCR as the share of stubble burning in Delhi's air pollution, as per SAFAR it was 'low' - has gone down substantially."" The sources that impacted Delhi's air quality were moderate wind speed and ventilation that is leading to the accumulation of pollutants. The AQI on Monday was 'very poor' and is unlikely to improve on Tuesday, SAFAR, a forecasting system under the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, IITM, Pune, said. ""The winds at transport level are increasing, resulting in more intrusion of farm fires related pollutants into Delhi. So the air quality is expected to remain at the higher end of very poor,"" the SAFAR forecast said on Monday.

During the hearing, the Delhi government informed Supreme Court that it's ready to impose a lockdown but since it doesn't have air boundaries, Central Government can consider having it in the entire NCR and lockdown has to be imposed as a whole. The Centre told Supreme Court that stubble burning is not the major cause of pollution at present in Delhi and northern states, as it contributes to only 10% of the pollution. It suggested three steps to bring down pollution including the introduction of an odd-even vehicle scheme, ban on trucks' entry in Delhi, and severest will be lockdown. Supreme Court observed that the major cause of air pollution in Delhi are dust, heavy vehicular traffic, and industries'; says if timely steps were taken by the government, pollution can be kept to manageable levels. The Apex court while perusing the Delhi government's affidavit said the affidavit is all about bashing farmers and how the entire cause is stubble burning. The court slammed the Delhi government saying it's passing the buck to Municipal Commissioner. ""This kind of lame excuse will force us to hold an audit of the revenue you are earning and spend on popularity slogans,"" SC told Delhi government.

Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai has called a joint meeting of all departments concerned, including environment department, Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), Delhi Development Authority (DDA), Public Works Department (PWD) and municipal corporations, on Tuesday to discuss steps to curb air pollution in the national capital from local sources. Rai had on Sunday written to the Centre, demanding that an emergency meeting of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan be called to discuss the issue of stubble burning. He said that stubble burning is the main reason behind the increased air pollution in Delhi according to the scientists. ""We had urged the Centre on Sunday to call an emergency meeting of all neighbouring states to reduce the incidents of stubble burning,"" Rai said. ""We have also called a meeting of all departments concerned at 12 noon on Tuesday to discuss what more can be done to reduce Delhi's own share of pollution."" According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality forecast agency SAFAR, stubble burning accounted for 48 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on Monday, the highest in three years. Last year, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution had peaked at 42 per cent on November 5. In 2019, crop residue burning accounted for 44 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on November 1. The minister also said that the Delhi government has deployed 114 tankers for water sprinkling to reduce air pollution in the capital. Delhi recorded severe air quality for three days on the trot till Sunday due to accumulation of emissions from fireworks on Diwali and stubble burning amid unfavourable meteorological conditions -- low temperature, wind speed and mixing height. On Tuesday, strong winds lowered pollution levels marginally and the air quality index stood at AQI 388 at 3 pm.

According to the District Collectorate Pradeep Dahiya, the majority of farmers have stopped burning crop residue but some of them trying to disrupt the environment. ""Majority of farmers have stopped burning crop residue but some of them trying to disrupt the environment. FIR is being filed against this recent incident,"" said Dahiya who visited the farmland on Monday. Meanwhile, the farmers in Punjab have said that they are burning the stubble out of helplessness and asked the state government to pay compensation of Rs 7000 per acre to them to stop the burning of stubble in their fields. They have also alleged that propaganda is being run against the farmers. The government has announced compensation worth Rs 43,15,000 but has not taken strict action against farmers. Consequently, the cases have been ramping up for 3-4 days. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has repeatedly blamed stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana for the air pollution in the national capital. The air quality in various parts of the national capital continues to remain in the 'severe category', informed the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) on Monday. As per SAFAR's analysis, an overall air quality index (AQI) of 432 was reported in the national capital. According to the government agencies, the AQI between 0-50 is considered good, 51-100 is satisfactory, 101-200 moderate, 201-300 poor, 301-400 very poor and 401-500 are marked as severe/hazardous.

His statement comes in wake of deteriorating air quality in Delhi-NCR post Diwali. The air quality in the national capital is now in the 'severe' category. There is smog in the air and it will continue till January, Dr. Kumar said. Speaking further, Kumar, citing the ""Lung Care Foundation"" study, said, ""More than 50 per cent of adolescents in Delhi have a higher incidence of chest symptoms, 29 per cent have asthma, 40 per cent are obese (200 per cent higher incidence of asthma). Children are suffering."" ""We have found that the children are coming with chest problems. They complain of having breathing problems. In short, air pollution is adversely affecting them,"" the doctor said. Further, Kumar said that children are also suffering from problems in the brain, lung, heart, and other organs due to pollution. Talking about air pollution and the measures that the government undertook to tackle it, Kumar said, ""Installing a smog tower is a colossal waste of public money and a grave mistake. The answer lies in preventing the air from getting polluted."" ""Pollution has killed more people than COVID but it has not been given the kind of attention it deserves,"" Kumar added. Kumar also said that some drastic steps need to be taken to control pollution. ""Stubble burning is one of the major areas that should be prioritised,"" he said. The air quality in Delhi continues to remain in the 'severe' category with the AQI standing at 436, said the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) on Sunday. The pollution level in the National Capital Region (NCR), namely Noida and Gurugram, was also worrisome. Noida reported AQI in the 'hazardous' category at 575, while the air quality in Gurugram was at the upper end of the 'severe' category at 478. Ashok Patel, Founder & CEO, Max Ventilator, said that while one can develop some respiratory disorders due to unavoidable reasons, taking lightly of seemingly minor issues with respiratory system can prove to be costly in the long run. He said that from respiratory allergies due to increased pollution to asthma to infections leading to pneumonia and bronchitis to extremely serious conditions such as lung cancer and COPD (a major respiratory disease known to be the second most common cause of death after heart disease in the country) and acute respiratory failure, the list is rather long and many of which would require immediate care and mechanical ventilation. He said that the ability to breathe normally and continuously through our respiratory organs constitutes an inextricable part of our very living. Any disruption, for whatever reasons, calls for immediate medical attention and care. Patel said that since due to increased pollution post-Diwali several people are facing breathing issues and respiratory problems, this is an opportune time to underline the need to take good care of respiratory organs. He said that poor care of respiratory organs leads to increased use of ventilators. At present, nearly 1.71 lakh Covid patients alone are on ventilators in the country and if combined with other serious respiratory patients this number could rise much higher. Dr Rajesh G Gajara, MD (Medicine), Consultant Physician and Cardiologist, Fortis, Mulund, said that people often tend to take most of the respiratory organs for granted as long as they are functioning externally not realising that the slightest issue with any one of the organs if not attended to timely could deteriorate into a debilitating disease for life requiring prolonged or even lifelong advanced level of medical attention including ventilatory assistance. ""Remember, COPD, a major respiratory condition has been the second most common cause of mortality after heart disease in the country. It becomes imperative to educate people on the need to take proper care of their respiratory organs regularly which would to a great extent forestall any respiratory emergency obviating the need for ventilator support,” Gajara said.

The Delhi government on Friday intensified various initiatives, including installations of anti-smog guns in various locations of the national capital to fight the increased pollution that reached 'severe category', a day after the celebrations of Diwali. Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai will visit ITO, Near Old PHQ for the installation of Anti-Smog Gun on Friday, according to Aam Aadmi Party sources. An anti-smog gun is a device to combat air pollution which will spray atomised water to settle the dust and other suspended particles in the atmosphere. Equipped with a water tank on a vehicle, it can spray water up to a height of 50 meters to settle dust particles and PM 2.5. Earlier in October, the Minister had claimed that the first smog tower installed at Connaught Place has reduced air pollution in the vicinity by up to 80 per cent. Last November, the government had installed 23 anti-smog guns at key intersections and construction sites across the city, and assured that this number will be increased, if necessary. Earlier, the government had made it mandatory for all construction sites of 20,000 square meters or above to use anti-smog guns and ensure minimum dust pollution. To curb increasing pollution, the Delhi government had also banned the sale and use of all kinds of firecrackers in the city ahead of Diwali. During its drive against firecrackers, more than 13,000 kgs of firecrackers had been seized with 33 people arrested by the Delhi police. However, despite the ban on firecrackers, on Thursday, the city witnessed people bursting them on the streets against the government's painstaking efforts and initiatives such as the 'Patakhe Nahi Diye Jalao' campaign. Winter in Delhi-NCR, infamous for episodes of thick smog and air pollution, witnessed the season's first fog with both the Indira Gandhi International Airport and the Safdarjung Airport reporting poor visibility with a significant reduction to the range of 600-800 meters on Thursday. This further aggravated the Air Quality Index (AQI), taking the index well above the 400 level which comes under the severe category. On Friday morning, the fog-shrouded Delhi-NCR, lowering visibility at the IGI and Safdarjung Airports to the range of 200 to 500 meters at 5.30 am. Visibility in other parts of the city dropped to 200 meters, according to weathermen.

At 8:00 am, the capital's air quality index (AQI) stood at 341, up from 314 at 4 pm on Wednesday. The 24-hour average AQI was 303 on Tuesday and 281 on Monday. AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. While SAFAR said the air quality may become 'severe' on November 5 and 6 if firecrackers are burnt, an official from the India Meteorological Department said model predictions do not indicate the AQI reaching the 'severe' category ""even with higher emissions"". The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality forecast agency said 3,271 farm fires accounted for eight per cent of Delhi's PM2. It is likely to increase to 20 per cent on Thursday (Diwali) and further to 35 to 40 per cent on Friday and Saturday with the wind direction changing to northwest, it said. Northwesterly winds carry smoke from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana towards the national capital. Last year, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution had peaked at 42 per cent on November 5. In 2019, crop residue burning accounted for 44 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on November 1. Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai had Wednesday urged the Centre to issue an advisory to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to completely stop stubble burning during the Diwali period so that people could breathe easy after the festival. The contribution of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 concentration was 32 per cent on Diwali day last year as compared to 19 per cent in 2019. The contribution of farm fires in Delhi's air pollution has remained low this season so far due to the record-breaking rainfall in October and ""unfavourable"" wind direction for transport of smoke from stubble burning. SAFAR said ""very calm"" local Delhi wind conditions with little ventilation is expected for the next three days which will be unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants. Under a zero firecracker emission scenario, Delhi's PM2.5 concentration is predicted to be in the upper end of the 'very poor' category from November 4 to November 6. ""However, even if we consider 50 per cent of firecracker load of 2019, the AQI is predicted to degrade to the 'severe' category during the period,"" SAFAR said. The PM2.5 concentration in the national capital can surpass 500 micrograms per cubic metre on November 5. The safe limit is 60 micrograms per cubic metre. On October 27, the Delhi government had launched the 'Patakhe Nahi Diye Jalao' campaign to create awareness against the bursting of crackers. Action is being taken under relevant IPC provisions and the Explosives Act against anyone found burning crackers under the campaign. On September 28, the Delhi Pollution Control Committee ordered a complete ban on the sale and bursting of firecrackers in the national capital till January 1, 2022. According to the government, more than 13,000 kg of illegal firecrackers have been seized and 33 people arrested under the anti-cracker campaign.

It stated that police have been asked to keep a strict vigil and show no tolerance for visible emissions by stopping ""visibly polluting vehicles"" from plying by impounding or issuing fines to offenders. The administration on October 6 released the 'winter action plan' to check pollution to various government agencies and authorities ahead of winters, during which air pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR), including Noida and Greater Noida, spikes to severe levels affecting human health. The administration asked the police to list traffic hot-spots in the district and release it and an advisory accordingly. ""Deploy additional man power and civil defence volunteers to ensure smooth traffic flow at identified traffic hot-spots and impound diesel vehicles older than 10 years and petrol vehicles older than 15 years in compliance of the Supreme Court's order,"" the plan stated.

To reduce dust pollution, especially in winters, and to make city streets greener, the Delhi government has decided to enhance greenery on its roads and flyovers with the help of shrubs, hedges, creepers and a variety of flowering plants, government officials said on Sunday. According to senior officials of the Public Works Department (PWD), central and side verges of roads and flyovers and walls of overbridges will be spruced up with seasonal flowering plants and shrubs on a number of identified road stretches and flyovers. ""Some of these stretches include the Ring Road, Chirag Delhi flyover, IIT flyover etc. In the mega drive we will use decorative and seasonal flowering plants, shrubs, hedges for roads and flyovers,"" a senior PWD official told. He said that tenders have been floated for the procurement of plant saplings, shrubs and hedges.
 
The official said that the main aim of the project is to cut down dust pollution due to open spaces and dirt patches on roads. No dry and vacant space will be left on roads for the dust to fly, the official said. The move comes after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal last month directed PWD officials to improve greenery to reduce dust pollution in the city. These overbridges include IIT flyover, Munirka flyover, Africa Avenue flyover, Chirag Delhi flyover, B-Avenue flyover, Masoodpur flyover and Panchsheel flyover. Officials said that greenery beneath these flyovers will be improved and road footpaths will also be made encroachment free.
 
""A variety of flowering plants such as Bougainvillea, Clerodendrum Inerme, Ipomea, Tradescantia, Tasmanian Flax-Lilly (Dianella Variegated) Kamal Cactus along with hedge plants will be used to beautify roads and flyovers. We will also use creepers on the flyover walls and pillars to enhance greenery and beautification of the structure,"" another PWD official said. Major arterial roads of the national capital are under the jurisdiction of the PWD. The department manages around 1,260 km-long roads in the city. The officials said that at least 42,000 plants saplings, hedges and shrubs will be used to beautify roads and flyovers in PWD's south sub-division.

In a tweet on Saturday, Kejriwal said that the Haryana government should also help its farmers and make bio-decomposer solution free. ""Haryana government should also help its farmers like Delhi government. Like Delhi, spraying of solution should be made free in all the fields of Haryana. Then there will be no need to burn the stubble,"" he wrote. The Delhi government in association with the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa developed a bio-decomposer capsule that can be converted into a solution to be sprayed on crop stubble in the farmlands. Once sprayed on the fields, the solution decomposes the stubble into compost in 20 days. On October 4, Kejriwal announced a 10-point ""winter action plan"" to tackle air pollution in the national capital. While making the announcement, he said, ""Currently, the air pollution is under control in Delhi but it will start rising with stubble burning in the neighbouring states in winters. The central government and neighbouring states did not do anything to check stubble burning by farmers which will lead to air pollution in the winter season."" In order to curb the problem of air pollution arising from the Construction and Demolition (C&D) activities in the National Capital Region (NCR), the Commission for Air Quality and Management (CAQM) issued directions to governments of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and the National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) to set up a 'Web Portal' for monitoring compliance of dust mitigation measures by project proponents. Keeping in view the dangerous condition of Delhi's air pollution during Diwali for the last three years, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has announced a complete ban on the storage, sale and use of all types of firecrackers. There will be a complete ban on the bursting and sale of all kinds of firecrackers up to January 1, 2022, in Delhi, as per the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. In September this year, the Centre has released Rs 496 crore to subsidize machinery required in-situ management of crop residue with an aim to address air pollution in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) due to stubble burning in the adjoining states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Sanjay Agarwal, Secretary of Union Ministry of Agriculture had informed that the Centre released Rs 496 crore for Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Punjab to subsidize machinery required in-situ management of crop residue during 2021-22.

It is also providing the Pusa- bio-decomposer, developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, free of cost to its farmers to prevent stubble burning. The clear blue skies over the national capital may go dark soon with dust and smoke as the stubble burning season nears. The satellite images by US space agency NASA have shown that crop residue burning has already started in several fields in Haryana and Punjab, according to media reports. Punjab annually generates 20 million tonnes of paddy straw, which is normally set on fire to quickly clear the fields for the next crop, resulting in choking of the National Capital Region (NCR) in October and November and causing major health effects. The latest NASA satellite data shows that more than 200 farm fires have been recorded in the Majha region of Punjab since September 1, according to media reports. By September 29, the count of fires was 66 in Punjab and 23 in Haryana. During October and November, stubble burning usually contributes between 20 per cent to 70 per cent of Delhi's air pollution. Last year, a report from the Environment Ministry showed that the average contribution of stubble burning to Delhi's air pollution increased from 10 per cent in 2019 to over 15 per cent in 2020. A study by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), estimates that crop residue burning releases 149.24 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2), over 9 million tonnes of carbon monoxide (CO), 0.25 million tonnes of oxides of sulphur (SOX), 1.28 million tonnes of particulate matter, and 0.07 million tonnes of black carbon. These directly contribute to environmental pollution: the heat from burning paddy straw penetrates 1 centimetre into the soil, increasing the temperature to 33.8 to 42.2 degrees Celsius, which kills the bacterial and fungal populations critical for fertile soil. Moreover, air pollution is considered the greatest environmental threat to health, and it disproportionately affects vulnerable populations: 91 per cent of deaths from ambient air pollution occur in low-income and middle-income countries. In India, 1,16,000 infant deaths in 2019 were attributable to air pollution, coal combustion was attributable for 1,00,000 deaths while ambient air pollution killed 16.7 lakh Indians, data released by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) showed. Meanwhile, state governments of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi and even the Centre have taken multiple measures to incentivise farmers and prevent them from setting their fields on fire. The Delhi government on Monday announced a set of 10 points formulated under its Winter Action Plan. It is also providing the Pusa- bio-decomposer, developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, free of cost to its farmers to prevent stubble burning. The Punjab government is focusing on increasing the use of paddy stubble in power generation. The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has asked the state's three thermal power plants to use paddy stubble as fuel to the extent of 10 per cent of total annual coal use.

To combat air pollution in the national capital, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has announced a ten-point ""winter action plan"" that focuses on dust control, using the Pusa bio-decomposer, installing smog towers, and checking waste burning and vehicular emissions. The chief minister also urged the neighbouring states to retrofit thermal power plants in NCR areas with new technology and ensure the use of CNG-operated vehicles and cleaner fuel in industries in the region. Kejriwal claimed that the Centre and neighbouring states have not done anything to check stubble burning, which will lead to a rise in air pollution in the winter season. He appealed to the governments of neighbouring states to work together to make the air clean. He also urged the Centre and states to ensure free spraying of the bio-decomposer for in-situ management of crop residue, as his government has been doing in Delhi. ""The Delhi government has provided a solution to the problem of stubble burning -- Pusa bio-decomposer. We hope it will be used as much as possible,"" he said. Kejriwal said the Delhi government has formed 75 teams for the inspection of construction and demolition sites to control dust pollution, and 250 teams to keep a check on waste burning. ""We have imposed a complete ban on the sale and purchase of firecrackers. The smog tower (at Connaught Place) has yielded good results so far. We will continue to monitor its performance and then take a call on constructing more such towers in Delhi,"" the CM said. Special teams have been formed to monitor pollution hotspots. Steps will also be taken to address traffic jams on 64 identified roads to reduce vehicular pollution. As many as 500 teams have been constituted to check Pollution Under Control certificates, he said. Kejriwal said strengthening of green war rooms and a public campaign will also be part of the ""winter action plan"". ""A programme management unit has been set up in the green war room with the help of the University of Chicago and GDI Partners, and 50 environmental engineers have been inducted into it,"" he said. Delhi had launched the 'Green War Room' last year to monitor and coordinate anti-pollution efforts and the ""Green Delhi"" application to effectively address complaints related to pollution-causing activities. ""We received 23,000 complaints on the app. Ninety-three per cent of them have been resolved,"" he said. The country's first eco-park to manage e-waste is being set up in Delhi, Kejriwal added. The chief minister said following in the footsteps of Delhi, the NCR areas should also ensure the use of clean fuel in thermal power plants and other industries, CNG-operated vehicles, hotspot monitoring and round-the-clock power supply to prevent the use of diesel generators. Brick kilns in NCR areas should switch to newer technology and monitoring of pollution hotspots be strengthened. Currently, air pollution is under control in Delhi but it will start rising with stubble burning in the neighbouring states in winters, he said.

Taking to Twitter, the chief minister said the decision has been taken in the wake of the pollution situation in the national capital, in the last three years during Diwali. The development comes after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday sought an appointment with Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav to discuss measures to be taken to reduce pollution in the national capital. The secretary to the Delhi environment minister wrote a letter to the Union minister's private secretary in this regard. Kejriwal had on Monday said he would call on the Union environment minister with the audit report of Pusa bio-decomposer, a microbial solution that can turn stubble into manure in 15-20 days, and ask him to direct states surrounding Delhi to distribute it for free among farmers. He had said the audit by a central agency has found the use of Pusa bio-decomposer highly effective. Meanwhile, with the aim of addressing air pollution, in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) due to stubble burning in the adjoining states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, the Centre has released Rs 496 crore to subsidize machinery required in-situ management of crop residue. Addressing the media in Delhi, Sanjay Agarwal, Secretary of Union Ministry of Agriculture informed that the Centre released Rs 496 crore for four state--Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Punjab to subsidize machinery required in-situ management of crop residue during 2021-22. ""For the year 2021-22 fund amounting Rs 235 crore has been released for Punjab, Rs 141 crore has been released for Haryana, Rs 115 crore for Uttar Pradesh and Rs 5 crore has been released for Delhi. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and other central agencies also received Rs 54.99 crore,"" informed Agarwal. In July this year, the Supreme Court had dismissed a plea challenging the National Green Tribunal's order for the imposition of a complete ban on the sale and use of all firecrackers during the COVID-19 pandemic in cities, said that no further clarification or deliberation was required. A Bench of Justice AM Khanwilkar and Justice Sanjiv Khanna had said that the NGT in its order has already decided the issue and no further clarification or deliberation was required. It further said that authorities may permit the sale and use of firecrackers as per the category of Air Quality Index (AQI) in the cities. The Bench said that manufacturing or production of firecrackers was allowed and those who wanted to use firecrackers could do so with permission depending upon the category of AQI. It clarified that the ban is in places where air quality is poor and there is no ban on the manufacture. ""Ban is the only defendant on-air category. The moment there is the poor quality of air, all activities should stop"", observed the Bench.

He said stubble burning in neighbouring states in October is a major factor behind the high level of air pollution in Delhi. ""The farmers are not at fault. Governments are at fault because they had to offer a solution,"" Kejriwal said. Last year, the Delhi government distributed the bio-decomposer free of cost which was used by farmers on 1,935 acres of land in 39 villages to convert stubble into manure, he said. A survey by a central government agency, WAPCOS, has come up with very encouraging results on the use of the bio-decomposer. Ninety per cent of the farmers claimed that the solution turned stubble into manure in 15-20 days. Also, the content of carbon in the soil increased by 40 per cent, nitrogen 24 per cent, bacteria seven times and fungi three times. Sprouting of wheat also increased by 17-20 per cent, the chief minister said. ""We appeal to the Centre to ask the states to distribute the bio-decomposer free of cost among farmers to stop them from burning stubble,"" he said.

According to a report released by a US research group on Wednesday, more than 480 million people living in the vast swathes of central, eastern and northern India, including New Delhi, endure significantly high pollution levels. ""Alarmingly, India's high levels of air pollution have expanded geographically over time,"" said the report prepared by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC). For example, air quality has significantly worsened in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, Reuters quoted the report's statement. The report also lauded India's National Clean Air Program (NCAP) and said, ""achieving and sustaining"" the NCAP goals would raise the country's overall life expectancy by 1.7 years and that of New Delhi 3.1 years."" According to the EPIC's findings, neighbouring Bangladesh could raise average life expectancy by 5.4 years if the country improves air quality to levels recommended by the World Health Organization. What experts say on smog towers in Delhi Smog towers may provide immediate relief from air pollution in a small area but they are a costly, quick-fix measure with no scientific evidence to back their long-term benefits, several experts said after the first such structure was inaugurated in Delhi. Government should instead tackle root causes and promote renewable energy to tackle air pollution and reduce emissions, the experts said. “It will be really unfortunate if other cities decide to follow suit and set up these expensive, ineffective towers. They are an enormous distraction from what should be the governments' focus: reducing emissions,” Santosh Harish, a fellow at the Centre for Policy Research said. While smog towers might come across as a visible solution to air pollution, there is no scientific evidence -- even globally -- to support that they can filter outdoor air effectively, added Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead at the Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment, and Water (CEEW). Their comments came soon after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal inaugurated India’s first smog tower in the city’s Connaught Place area last month. The government claimed it will purify 1,000 cubic meters of air per second within a radius of around one kilometre. Kejriwal said the over 24-meter tall structure, the first of its kind in India, has been set up as a pilot project and initial trends will be available within a month. If the pilot project is successful, more smog towers will be installed in the national capital.

Based on the results, the government will take a decision on installing more towers. The Delhi government in October last year granted approval for the 20-metre-long structure which will improve air quality. The tower, built at a cost of Rs 20 crore, has been funded by the Delhi government. A smog tower is basically a structure designed to work as a large-scale air purifier to curb air pollution particles. Notably, Delhi is one of the most polluted cities across the country. The city witnesses a major fall in its air quality during winter.

Lockdowns have improved the air quality in Delhi-NCR this year as well but not as effectively as last year due to the 2021 curbs being shorter and lesser stringent, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has found in a study. Meteorology would be partly responsible for this trend, but it could also be a reflection of weakening of pollution control-measures and efforts in the city and region, it said. Traffic intensity was also comparatively higher in 2021, it added. This year, restrictions in Delhi started on April 6 in the form of night-curfews and weekend lockdowns with complete lockdowns being imposed on April 19. The imposition of partial-lockdown lowered PM2.5 pollutant levels by 20 per cent; while the complete lockdown brought the average down by further 12 per cent, according to the CSE analysis. ""In 2020, partial lockdown started on March 12 with hard lockdown kicking in on March 25, which was lifted in phase-wise manner from May 18. Then the partial lockdown also brought PM2.5 levels down by 20 per cent, but the hard lockdown reduced it by another 35 per cent,"" the CSE said. Lifting of restrictions from May 18 had led to 28 per cent rise in PM2.5 levels, it said. The green think-tank also said the lockdown summers in 2020 and 2021 have been 25 to 40 per cent cleaner as compared to the summer of 2019. It also said that spring of 2021 (January-March) has recorded the highest pollution levels for the season since 2019. Normally, PM2.5 levels have a seasonal cycle with winter being the most polluted and monsoon season being the cleanest. Spring (January to March) acts as a transitional period between the two extremes- winter and summer A significant drop in PM2.5 levels happens as the weather warms up and wind picks up speed during spring. ""There was a 26 per cent drop between winter of 2018 and spring of 2019. In 2020, this drop increased to 36 per cent due to pollution control measures in place and also imposition of partial lockdowns in March 2020. But this downward trend in spring pollution did not continue this year, with seasonal drop limited to 18 per cent,"" the report said. ""In fact, spring this year has been 31 per cent dirtier than 2020 and 8 per cent dirtier than 2019,"" it said. The CSE analysis also showed that there were 27 ""very poor"" days in terms of air quality this February-March compared to 17 in 2020 and 12 in 2019. Days meeting the air quality standard also plummeted this spring to just two. The year 2020 had 16 and 2019 had six days when the standard was met, it said.

The loss of smell, a condition known as anosmia, can severely impact a person's quality of life, making it extremely difficult to taste foods, detect airborne hazards in the environment, and carry out other functions dependent on the senses. Covid-19 has further thrust olfaction into the spotlight as olfactory disturbances appear to be both a cardinal symptom and, in some cases, a debilitating consequence of the ongoing global pandemic, said researchers from the Johns Hopkins University in the US. While previous research has associated PM2.5 as a likely culprit for anosmia, the team from Johns Hopkins conducted a new study to better understand how long-term exposure to air pollution can rob someone of the ability to smell and taste. They found long-term airborne exposure to PM2.5 increases the risk of losing one's smell by nearly twice (a 1.6- to 1.7-fold increase). This may occur because the location of the olfactory nerve, which contains the sensory nerve fibres relating to the sense of smell, places it directly in the path of inhaled PM2.5 materials. The findings appeared in the JAMA Network Open. ""Based on this result, we feel that long-term exposure to high levels of PM2.5 represents a common risk factor for the loss of sense of smell, especially in vulnerable populations such as older people -- but also one that is potentially modifiable if sources of PM2.5 components can be better controlled,"" said lead author Murugappan Ramanathan, rhinologist and associate professor of otolaryngology -- head and neck surgery at the University's School of Medicine. In their study, the researchers looked at 2,690 people, aged 18 and older, who were evaluated by otolaryngologists between January 2013 and December 2016. Of these, 538 were diagnosed with anosmia, with an average age of 54 and with men making up the majority (339 or 63 per cent). Exposure to PM2.5 has been already linked to cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, decline in cognitive thinking ability, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and premature death.

Air Quality Index is a tool for effective communication of air quality status to people in terms, which are easy to understand. It transforms complex air quality data of various pollutants into a single number (index value), nomenclature and colour. There are six AQI categories, namely Good, Satisfactory, Moderately polluted, Poor, Very Poor, and Severe. Each of these categories is decided based on ambient concentration values of air pollutants and their likely health impacts (known as health breakpoints).

Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia who is also the Finance Minister in the Arvind Kejriwal-led ruling AAP government, presenting the annual estimated budget for the financial year 2021-22 stated that the city's air pollution is the biggest problem, and ""the government was working on a 360 degree-approach to tackle it"". He said that the government was working towards a pollution-free Delhi by India's 100th year of independence. ""Delhi government is working on 360 degree-approach to tackle the problem of pollution in the city. We are introducing measures step-by-step. Our government is also working on increasing the green cover of Delhi. Anti-smog guns were made mandatory at construction sites and coming up with policies for the better management of solid waste. We have prepared a roadmap by which we have aimed that by 100th of independence, Delhi can leave behind the problem of pollution, just like Covid-19,"" Sisodia said in his budget speech. The minister highlighted Delhi government's electric vehicle policy, claiming that EV policy 2020 was one among several measures taken for reducing the pollution of the national capital. Sisodia said that before this initiative, the share of electric vehicles in Delhi was merely 0.2 per cent of the total registered vehicles. However, after the policy was launched, this share has increased to 2.2 per cent of the total registered vehicles in the Capital. ""Now, we have planned that by 2024, the share of electric vehicles in Delhi will improve to around 25 per cent and to make this happen, we are working towards installing as many as 500 charging points. 72 such charging points are already operational. We will ensure that by 2024 Delhi will have EV charging points at the distance of every three km,"" The minister added. Apart from EV policy, the Delhi Finance Minister also highlighted the public transport system of the city. He pointed out that the population of the national capital has reached close to 3 crore. To augment the public transport infrastructure, Sisodia said 1,300 additional e-buses will be added to the city's fleet. For the first time in the last decade, Delhi has managed to get 6,693 public buses in its fleet; another 1,000 will be added by September.

According to a Greenpeace Southeast Asia analysis of IQAir data, 1800 deaths per million were estimated due to PM2.5 air pollution in Delhi. ""The PM2.5 air pollution claimed approximately 54,000 lives in India's national capital in 2020,"" the study said. PM2.5 refers to fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter. Exposure to PM2.5 is considered the most important environmental risk factor for deaths globally, and was attributed to 4.2 million premature deaths in 2015, the study said. The study noted that the damage is equally worrying in other Indian cities. ""An estimated 25,000 avoidable deaths in Mumbai in 2020 have been attributed to air pollution. Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad and Lucknow estimated an approximate 12000, 11000, 11000, and 6700 avoidable deaths respectively due to polluted air,"" it said.

""Despite a temporary reprieve in air quality owing to the lockdown, the latest figures from the report underscore the need to act immediately. The need of the hour is to rapidly scale up renewable energy, bring an end to fossil fuel emissions and boost sustainable and accessible transport systems,"" the study said. Globally, approximate 160,000 deaths have been attributed to PM2.5 air pollution in the five most populous cities of Delhi (30 million), Mexico City (22 million), Sao Paulo (22 million), Shanghai (26 million) and Tokyo (37 million), it said. ""Despite recording relatively better air quality this year due to strict lockdown, air pollution continues to be a serious public health issue which also drastically impacts our economy. For the governments of the day, it is crucial that investments are made towards green and sustainable solutions. When we choose fossil fuel over clean energy, our health is put at stake. Polluted air increases the likelihood of deaths due to cancer & stroke, spike in asthma attacks and worsens severity of COVID-19 symptoms,ö said Avinash Chanchal, Climate Campaigner, Greenpeace India."" ""We need to ensure our growth demand is fuelled by sustainable and cleaner sources of energy and cities should promote low cost , active and carbon-neutral transport options that prioritises walking, cycling, and public transport, the increased use of clean energy and clean transport will not only improve the public health but it will also strengthen the economy and public money"" added Chanchal. Commenting on the revelations made by cost estimator CEO of IQAir, Frank Hammes says, ""Breathing should not be deadly. The fact that poor air quality claimed an estimated 160,000 lives in the five largest cities alone should give us pause, especially in a year when many cities were seeing lower air pollution levels due to less economic activity. Governments, corporations and individuals must do more to eliminate the sources of air pollution and make our cities better places to live."" To show the impact of air pollution related deaths on the economy, Greenpeace said it used the approach called ""willingness-to-pay"" which means a lost life year or a year lived with disability is converted to money by the amount that people are willing to pay in order to avoid this negative outcome.

Published by the House of Commons (lower house of the British parliament) Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, the report called on the British government to address alarming levels of poor air quality in England, highlighting a strong and established case for tackling air pollution, the Xinhua news agency reported. Warning of air pollution's deadliness and its disproportionate impact on disadvantaged communities, members of the committee reaffirmed that improving air quality should be at the core of the post-pandemic rebuilding. The report also urged the government to set tougher targets to lower air pollution if it hopes to reduce the health inequalities laid bare by the Covid-19 pandemic, as the most disadvantaged communities who contribute the least to air pollution suffer the most from its effects. It also raised concerns that the government's current Clean Air Strategy ""lacks the ambition"" to fully address the challenges posed by poor air quality. ""In rebuilding after the pandemic, we have a moral duty to put improving air quality at its core. While the Clean Air Strategy is a step in the right direction, the government needs to be more ambitious,"" said Chair of the committee Neil Parish. In January 2019, the British government announced the Clean Air Strategy setting out plans to meet ambitious legally binding international targets to reduce the emission of the five most damaging air pollutants by 2030.

If your child is exposed to air pollution, they may have a decline in thinking skills in later life, a study suggests. The study indicates that greater exposure to air pollution at the very start of life was associated with a detrimental effect on people's cognitive skills up to 60 years later. ""For the first time we have shown the effect that exposure to air pollution very early in life could have on the brain many decades later,"" said co-author Tom Russ from the University of Edinburgh. ""This is the first step towards understanding the harmful effects of air pollution on the brain and could help reduce the risk of dementia for future generations,"" Russ added. For the study, published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, the researchers tested the general intelligence of more than 500 people, who were a part of Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 study, aged approximately 70 years using a test they had all completed at the age of 11 years. The test was repeated at the ages of 76 and 79 years. And, a record of where each person had lived throughout their life was used to estimate the level of air pollution they had experienced in their early years. The findings showed exposure to air pollution in childhood had a small but detectable association with worse cognitive change between the ages of 11 and 70 years. This study shows it is possible to estimate historical air pollution and explore how this relates to cognitive ability throughout life, the researchers said. Researchers say until now it has not been possible to explore the impact of early exposure to air pollution on thinking skills in later life because of a lack of data on air pollution levels before the 1990s when routine monitoring began. For this study, the team used a model called the EMEP4UK atmospheric chemistry transport model to determine pollution levels -- known as historical fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations -- for the years 1935, 1950, 1970, 1980, and 1990. They combined these historical findings with contemporary modelled data from 2001 to estimate life course exposure.

The researchers, including those from the University College London, UK, noted that AMD is the leading cause of irreversible blindness among the over 50s in high-income countries, with the numbers of those affected projected to reach 300 million by 2040. Known risk factors include older age, smoking, and genetic make-up, they said. Given that ambient air pollution is associated with heightened risks of heart and respiratory diseases, the study, published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology, analysed if it might also be associated with a heightened risk of AMD. The researchers drew on data from 115,954 UK Biobank (UKBB) study participants aged 40-69 with no eye problems at the start of this study in 2006. Measures of ambient air pollution included those for particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Of the total number of study participants, 1,286 were diagnosed with AMD, according to the researchers. Among the 52,602 people whose eyes had been assessed, 75 per cent of those with a clinical diagnosis of AMD had signs of AMD on retinal imaging compared to only 12 per cent of those without a clinical diagnosis of AMD, they said. Analysis of the data showed that higher fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ) exposure was associated with a higher (8 per cent) risk of AMD, while all other pollutants, except coarse particulate matter, were associated with changes in retinal structure. The researchers noted that it is an observational study, and as such, can't establish cause., adding the findings, however, echo those found elsewhere in the world. They suggest ambient air pollution could plausibly be associated with AMD through oxidative stress or inflammation. ""Overall, our findings suggest that ambient air pollution, especially fine particulate matter or those of combustion-related particles, may affect AMD risk,"" the researchers noted.

As per Safar India, AQI is forecasted to further deteriorate in Delhi to the higher end of the very poor category by Wednesday and Thursday and quite a few regions may even experience severe AQI for a shorter time period, especially during the early morning. A secondary particulate formation mechanism (which rapidly multiplies particulate pollution) is forecasted not to be triggered at present. The overall air quality has deteriorated to the higher end of the very poor category as forecasted. Surface-level winds are low and Westerly. Surface winds are likely to further slow down and surface inversion is likely to form. Under the calm wind-cold conditions, fog formation is likely in the region, Safar India said. This would be mainly radiative fog as a result of locally generated favourable weather conditions and may not persist for long. Slowing of dispersion owing to low ventilation is forecasted for the next two days. At Mathura Road in Delhi, AQI is in the severe category with PM 10 of 509 and PM 2.5 of 456. Lodhi Road is better in the very poor category with PM 10 of 375 and PM 2.5 of 395. During the day on Tuesday, AQI was in the severe category at several places. It was 527 at Patparganj, 522 in Sriniwaspuri, 528 in Noida, 575 in Faridabad, 547 in Anand Vihar, and 399 at Mandir Marg, which was the best reading in the city.

The air quality is likely to remain 'severe' on Wednesday too. No major improvement is predicted till December 26, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the India Meteorological Department's regional forecasting centre, said. The city's 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) was 418, which falls in the severe category. It was 332 on Monday, 321 on Sunday and 290 on Saturday. Air pollution in the neighbouring cities of Faridabad (407), Ghaziabad (468), Greater Noida (458) and Noida (450) also entered the ""severe"" zone. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe"". Srivastava attributed the dip in the air quality to slow wind speed, low temperature, and high humidity due to a Western Disturbance. Low temperature makes the air heavier, trapping pollutants close to the ground, he said. On Tuesday, the minimum temperature was 5.3 degrees Celsius and the maximum wind speed 8 kmph. The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the city's ventilation index, a product of mixing depth and average wind speed, was 2,000 m2/s on Tuesday and is likely to be 2,500 m2/s on Wednesday. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. Air quality in Noida, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida and Faridabad The average air quality plunged to ""severe"" level in Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida and Faridabad, while it was ""very poor"" in Gurgaon, according to a 24-hour data issued by a government agency on Tuesday. Presence of pollutant PM 2.5 and PM 10 also remained high in the five immediate neighbours of Delhi, according to the air quality index (AQI) maintained by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). According to the index, an AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. The average 24-hour AQI at 4 pm on Tuesday was 458 in Ghaziabad, 450 in Greater Noida, 437 in Noida, 407 in Faridabad and 377 in Gurgaon, according to CPCB's Sameer app. The CPCB states that an AQI in the ""very poor"" category may cause respiratory illness on prolonged exposure while ""severe"" affects even healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases. The average AQI on Monday was 391 in Ghaziabad, 366 in Greater Noida, 363 in Noida, 289 in Faridabad and 271 in Gurgaon, while on Sunday it was 346 in both Ghaziabad and Greater Noida, 333 in Noida, 294 in Faridabad and 262 in Gurgaon. The AQI for each city is based on the average value of all stations there. Noida, Faridabad, Ghaziabad have four stations each, while Gurgaon has three and Greater Noida two, according to the app. (With PTI Inputs) TOP NEWS JPC on Waqf Bill: Huge uproar erupts, Owaisi and 9 other MPs suspended from today's meeting Sunny Deol's much-awaited pan-India film 'Jaat' locks its release date | Check new poster ICC announces ODI Team of 2024, no Indian on list LATEST NEWS Sunny Deol's much-awaited pan-India film 'Jaat' locks its release date | Check new poster BPSC 70th CCE Prelims 2024 Result released, what's next A look at top 10 oldest trains in India, some running on tracks for over 150 years Rajasthan: Three die as bus collides with car in Bikaner © 2009-2025 Independent News Service.

The air quality, however, is expected to improve by Monday as the wind speed is likely to pick up. At 10 am, the city's air quality index (AQI) was 401, which falls in the ""severe"" category. The 24-hour average AQI was 382 on Friday, 341 on Thursday, 373 on Wednesday, 367 on Tuesday, 318 on Monday and 268 on Sunday. Air pollution in the neighbouring cities of Ghaziabad (AQI 446), Greater Noida (401) and Noida (406) also entered the ""severe"" zone. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe"". The wind speed remained slow allowing the accumulation of pollutants generated locally, V K Soni, head of the IMD's environment research centre said. ""Easterly winds carrying moisture also led to the formation of secondary particulate matter. All these factors together pushed the air quality in the 'severe' zone,"" he said. However, Soni said, the air quality is likely to improve to the ""poor"" category by Monday as the wind speed is expected to pick up. According to the IMD, the maximum wind speed is likely to be 8 kmph on Saturday, 10 kmph on Sunday and 15 kmph on Monday. The minimum temperature in Delhi was 11 degrees Celsius on Saturday and the maximum is expected to settle around 28 degrees Celsius, the weather department said. However, the minimum temperature is likely to dip again with the wind direction changing to northwesterly by Monday, according to IMD officials. Westerly and northwesterly winds blow from snow-laden western Himalayas towards the plains. Shallow to moderate fog is also predicted over the next two days, the IMD said. The minimum temperature this season has remained 2-3 notches below normal in the absence of a cloud cover on most days, according to IMD officials. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the city's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed -- is likely to be 2,500 m2/s on Friday. Mixing depth is the vertical height at which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for the dispersal of pollutants.

332,IndiaTV News,https://www.indiatvnews.com/health/food-that-helps-build-resistance-against-air-pollution-669390,Natural antioxidants to help build resistance against air pollution,"Published : Dec 05, 2020 9:10 IST, Updated : Dec 14, 2020 16:51 IST","Food that helps build resistance against air pollution The air that we all are breathing has reached dangerous levels of pollution yet again. People with no known history of respiratory problems are visiting hospital emergency rooms. As the hazardous air quality in a few cities touched the severe plus mark last week, Practo, integrated healthcare company, witnessed a growth of 20 percent in respiratory related queries in cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Kolkata. Here, 35 percent of all queries from metro cities were related to respiratory and pulmonary health concerns. The polluted air that everyone inhales injects ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter into the lungs. The protective antioxidants available in the lining of our lungs counter it until they are out forced, after which the pollutants begin attacking the immune system. Then the body cells form free radicals that cause inflammation. However, did you know that antioxidants from the food you eat could lend protection from the harmful impact caused by air pollutants? Here are some natural antioxidants that can help your body deal with this problem. This fat-soluble vitamin is our first line of defense against any injury to human tissues. Vitamin E in our diet generally comes from plant-based cooking oils. Sunflower, safflower, rice bran oil are some of the sources followed by canola, peanut, and olive oil. Almonds and seeds of sunflowers are also good sources of this vitamin. Seeds and nuts are rich in fat calories too. So around one ounce per day is sufficient. In addition, you can avail them in the form of spices and herbs such as chili powder, paprika, cloves, and basil, which contain a decent amount of vitamin E. Generally, most of these are consumed in very small quantities. Making them a part of your regular cooking will help add up to the required total. It plays a very critical role in controlling inflammation due to its antioxidant activity. It is also converted to vitamin A in your body. Leafy vegetables such as spinach, amaranth, methi, and coriander are some of the best sources of beta carotene. Carrots and radish leaves are also very effective. It is amongst the most potent antioxidant for our bodies. This water-soluble vitamin is found all through our body and it removes free radicals. Vitamin C also contributes to the regeneration of vitamin E. Sufficient vitamin C in our regular diet is important for maintaining its level in the lungs. Adults require around 40mg of this vitamin/day. Fruits such as oranges, amla, and guava are good sources while amongst the vegetables, cabbage and turnip greens contain vitamin C.

The city also recorded nine ""severe"" air days this November, the maximum number in the month in four years. The 30-day average AQI in November stood at 328, in the very poor category, while it was 312 in the month last year, according to Central Pollution Control Board data. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe"". The 30-day average was the lowest last year, while it was the highest (374) in November 2016. It was 335 in 2018 and 361 in 2017. The air quality remained ""severe"" on nine days this November, while there were seven such days in the month last year. There were five ""severe"" air days each in November 2018 and 2017, according to CPCB data. Pollutions levels breached the emergency threshold twice this month as a grey apocalyptic smog enveloped Delhi for days, blotting out the sun from the sky and smudging landmarks from view. According to the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), the air quality is considered in the ""severe plus"" or ""emergency"" category if PM2.5 and PM10 levels persist above 300 µg/m3 and 500 µg/m3 for more than 48 hours. Pollution levels on Diwali this year and the day after were the maximum in the last four years despite the city government and the National Green Tribunal banning the sale and use of all kinds of firecrackers till November 30. Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of the India Meteorological Department said, the air was fouler this November as there was lesser precipitation as compared to last year. ""The monsoon withdrew around October 10 last year, while the wind system receded early this year, around September 23-24,"" he said. Srivastava said Delhi received rains only on one day this November. The number of rainy days was two and three in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The other major reason was large-scale stubble burning, he said. Farmers started burning crop residue early due to early harvesting this year. Also, the farm fires raged for a longer duration. Punjab alone recorded 76,590 cases of stubble burning this season, the highest in the last four years. The number was 55,210 last year. An official from Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) said the incidents of stubble burning hit the peak between November 4 and November 7. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi-NCR's pollution peaked to 42 per cent on November 5, when 4,135 farm fires were recorded in the region. ""It was a bumper harvest this year, so the amount of crop residue was also large. Also, it was a cloud-free season this year as compared to last year. The biomass was drier and prone to burning,"" the IARI official said.

His assurance comes at a time when the city, along with various other states, are caught in the chokehold of severe air pollution. Delhi's air quality had taken a sharp turn for worse on Tuesday, after a brief lull from an early November spell of pollution largely caused by farm fires in Punjab and Haryana. ""In years to come, the air quality will substantially improve. I am optimistic. In the last four-five years, we have observed that the air quality is getting space in political agenda and public discussion. It is becoming a subject of concern and therefore there is demand for cleaner air and fast-track actions,"" Gargava emphasised. Another reason for believing that the air quality will improve, he said, is that in the last four-five years, there have been substantial scientific inputs and policy making frameworks. ""Earlier, actions were based on perceptions or limited data. Now more and more in-depth scientific analysis, data and knowledge are being looked at carefully by the policymakers. We are on the right track,"" he added. Gargava also said that the pollution control board is setting up a mechanism to track the progress of implementation of National Clean Air Programme (NCAP). The programme was launched last year by the Centre to reduce particulate matter pollution by 20-30 per cent in at least 102 cities by 2024. ""We are working on developing a dashboard which essentially will capture not only physical and financial progress but also change in air quality levels. It will be city-specific,"" he said. ""We are also planning to put up a 10-city super network wherein much more in-depth measurement and scientific analysis will be done. We will more promote Atmanirbhar instrumentation so that our reliability on indigenous instruments also goes up.""

The predominant surface wind direction was northwesterly and the maximum wind speed 12 kmph on Sunday, it said, adding that the wind speed is likely to drop to eight kmph on Monday. The central agency said the AQI is likely to deteriorate to the upper end of the ""very poor"" category between Tuesday and Friday. As many as 649 farm fire counts were observed over Punjab, Haryana and adjoining regions on Saturday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR. Stubble burning accounted for 12 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on Sunday. It was 13 per cent on Saturday, 15 per cent on Friday, 20 per cent on Thursday and eight per cent on Wednesday. The minimum temperature settled at 6.9 degrees Celsius on Sunday,  the lowest in the month of November in 17 years, according to IMD. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. Delhi's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was around 6,500 m2/s on Sunday and is likely to drop to 1,500 m2/s on Monday and Tuesday. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. Earlier in the day, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said the Public Works Department has installed 23 anti-smog guns and deployed 150 tankers for water sprinkling at key intersections and construction sites to reduce dust pollution.

In view of the deadly smog that has engulfed the national capital, health experts on Sunday said they have seen a substantial increase in patients with respiratory disorders in the Delhi-NCR region. Air pollution is an important cause of worsening of respiratory disorders, including sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, bronchitis and respiratory difficulty in those patients who do not smoke or have pre-asthmatic conditions. According to experts, air pollution also plays a significant role in making Covid infections worse. Dr. Praveen Gupta, Director and Head, Neurology, Fortis Hospital in Gurugram told IANS: ""Pollution has been identified as a leading cause of stroke and heart disease increasing the risk by 25 per cent in people who do not have risk factors for stroke or any heart ailment."" ""Exposure to high levels of air pollutants may cause irritation to the eyes, nose and throat, wheezing, coughing, breathing problems. Air pollution can also affect existing lung and heart conditions,"" he added. Smog can cause irritation in the eyes, throat and can damage the lungs, can also lead to fatigue, migraine, headaches, anxiety and depression. ""It can also worsen the skin, cause allergic disorders as well as significant hair problems,"" Gupta added. He has observed a 25 per cent increase in patients with respiratory disorders in the OPD in past weeks. Dr. Puneet Khanna, HOD and consultant-Respiratory Medicine, HCMCT Manipal Hospitals in Delhi said that as the winter approaches, smog is exacerbated by low temperature and slow movement of air. ""Ground-level ozone O3 and PM2.5 play a significant role in the formation of smog. Besides industrial activities and public transportation, stubble burning and road dust are majorly responsible for smog in winters,"" Khanna informed. The vulnerable group include newborns and children, pregnant women, elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, diabetics, angina and cardiac diseases. Peaks in air pollution often irritate the upper and lower respiratory system making it harder to breathe besides aggravating symptoms of asthma and COPD. According to Dr. Khanna, even a small increase in air pollution leads to heavy rush in OPDs, increased emergency room visits, hospitalisations and deaths. Long-term risks include lung cancer and reduction in life expectancy. ""During smog periods, these people should avoid intense physical activity outdoors particularly in morning and evening hours. They should venture out if absolutely essential and preferably wear an N95 mask during peak hours,"" he said.

As per System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR-India), the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) at 313. Most parts of the city reported AQIs in the 'poor' category including the area around Anand Vihar (256), RK Puram (290), and Patparganj (279), data from the Central Pollution Control Board. The air quality in Dwarka Sector 8 and Jahangirpuri was reported in the 'very poor' category, with AQIs of 303 and 323 respectively. An AQI between 0-50 is marked good, 51-100 is satisfactory, 101- 200 is moderate, 201- 300 is poor, 301-400 is very poor and 401-500 is considered severe. Meanwhile, the Delhi government on Monday launched the second phase of the 'Red Light On, Gaadi Off' campaign to curb air pollution in the national capital. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said the Delhi Jal Board will reduce the pollution load in the Yamuna by 90 per cent by March 2023. At a review meeting, DJB officials presented a detailed plan to Kejriwal and Water Minister Satyendar Jain in this regard. Major interventions include treatment of around 150 MGD polluted water coming from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh using natural wetlands and the aeration method. ""Second, the wastewater in small and big drains will be tapped into sewage treatment plants.
Third, steps will be taken to improve the quality of the existing STPs, including upgrading all the equipment and using innovative processes,"" a DJB statement said. A CPCB report had stated pollution levels were higher this Diwali, as compared to the last year and this could be attributed to a high share of stubble burning and unfavourable meteorology during the festival season. In a special report, the apex pollution watchdog said almost all pollutants reported higher values on Diwali day this year as compared to 2019.

It was 8 per cent on Wednesday and 3 per cent on Tuesday. A total of 967 fire fires were observed in Punjab, Haryana and western Pakistan on Thursday, it said. The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi also said Delhi-NCR's air quality is likely to remain in the ""poor"" to the lower end of the ""very poor"" category on Friday. SAFAR also said the conductive meteorological environment created after rainfall is slowly retreating and a deterioration in the air quality is likely. The minimum temperature settled at 9.4 degrees Celsius on Thursday - the lowest this season so far - and the maximum wind speed was predicted to be 10 kmph, according to the India Meteorological Department.

In a study of women aged 80 years and older, published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, living in locations with higher exposure to air pollution was associated with increased depressive symptoms. ""This is the first study showing how air pollution exposures affect depressive symptoms as well as the interrelationship between the symptoms and subsequent memory decline that had not been found in older people aged less than 80 years,"" said study lead author Andrew Petkus from the University of Southern California in the US . When looking at individual air pollutants, the research found that long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide or fine particulate air pollution was associated with increased depressive symptoms, but with only a small effect. Results also suggested that depressive symptoms might play a role in linking long-term air pollution exposure to memory decline more than 10 years after the exposure. ""We know late-life exposures to ambient air pollutants accelerate brain aging and increase the dementia risk,"" said study senior author Jiu-Chiuan Chen. ""But our new findings suggest the oldest-old populations may respond to air pollution neurotoxicity in a different way that needs to be investigated further,"" Chen added.

In a special report, the CPCB said almost all pollutants reported higher values on Diwali day and pre-Diwali day this year as compared to 2019. When the fog is mixed with pollutants to form 'smog' that it becomes dangerous for your health  and the main reason for the formation of smog is the increasing air pollution. Air pollutants from cars and Diwali crackers like sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and various industrial pollutants like carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, ozone and particulate matter mix with fog to form a dense layer in the atmosphere called smog.

In a special report, the CPCB said almost all pollutants reported higher values on Diwali day and pre-Diwali day this year as compared to 2019. ""It is observed that if compared with 2019 pre-Deepawali day (21.10.2019) concentrations of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 were found to be much higher on pre-Deepawali day (on 09.11.2020) at all the monitored locations, while SO2 concentrations were at a similar level. On Deepawali day (14.11.2020), almost all the pollutants reported higher values as compared to 2019 Diwali day,"" the report stated. However, the report attributed its outcome to the high share of stubble burning and meteorological conditions and the perennial issue of deteriorated air quality during November in Delhi-NCR, not on account of fire-cracker bursting. Though Pitampura recorded an increase in PM and SO2 indicating the impact of firecracker bursting on Deepawali day, it added. ""The contribution of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 concentration was 32 per cent on Diwali day this year as compared to 19 per cent last year. Therefore, it may be inferred that elevated PM2.5 concentrations in 2020 in comparison to previous year had enhanced contribution of stubble burning and the same is also reflected in elevated levels of CO and NO2,"" the report revealed. The CPCB observed that the hourly average concentration of PM2.5 started increasing from 11 p.m. on November 14, it reached peak in most of the stations at around 1 a.m. and continued at higher levels till 5 a.m. The city-level average calculated for PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations on Deepawali day (14.11.2020) were 645 µg/m3 and 483 µg/m3 respectively. ""Most of the parameters including PM2.5 monitored by stations set-up at IHBAS (Dilshad Garden), DMS (Shadipur) and NSIT (Dwarka) were found more on both pre-Deepawali and Deepawali days compared to 2019,"" the report added. Meanwhile, the central agency noticed a significant drop in the noise pollution level this year in comparison to 2019. The manual monitoring of six locations before Diwali revealed that the noise level was found declined at Lajpat Nagar, Mayur Vihar Phase-II, and Janakpuri, in comparison to the previous year. However, the highest level was recorded at Kamla Nagar this year on pre-Deepawali day, the report stated Meanwhile, real-time monitoring of ten stations showed that day time noise levels have decreased in 2020 as compared to pre-Deepawali day of 2019 at seven locations. Only NSIT Dwarka, R.K. Puram and ITO stations have recorded a slight increase in day time noise. The night-time noise found increased at Anand Vihar and ITO, the report said. CPCB carried out the ambient air quality and noise level monitoring on select pre-Deepawali day (09.11.2020) and on Deepawali day (14.11.2020) in Delhi like previous years. Ambient Air Quality was monitored at 40 locations (3 manual stations and 37 real-time stations). The ambient Noise level was monitored at 16 locations (06 manual and 10 real-time noise monitoring stations). Three continuous air quality stations (operated by CPCB, NABL accredited) have been used for comparison with the last five years' data. CPCB carried out ambient air quality and noise level monitoring on pre-Deepawali and Deepawali day in Delhi. The air quality was monitored at 40 locations with 3 manual stations and 37 real-time stations. Meanwhile, the ambient noise level was monitored at 16 locations including 6 manual and 10 real-time noise monitoring stations. The air quality dipped to severe at several places across the national capital on Saturday night owing to a combination of stubble burning and firecrackers burst during the Diwali celebrations in violation of a ban on the same. The Air Quality Index (AQI) for PM 2.5 pollutant stood at 481 in Anand Vihar, 444 in IGI Airport area, 457 in ITO, and 414 in Lodhi Road area, all four in the 'severe' category, at 11 pm on Saturday, according to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) data.

It said peak levels of PM10 and PM2.5 are expected between 1 am and 6 am in case of additional internal emissions. Earlier, it had said that the PM2.5 concentration in Delhi on Diwali is likely to be the ""lowest"" in the last four years if no firecrackers are burnt. The city recorded an overall AQI of 414 on Saturday, which falls in the ""severe"" category. The 24-hour average AQI was 339 on Friday and 314 on Thursday.

A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel clarified that the direction will apply to all cities and towns in the country where the average of ambient air quality during November 2019 was in ""poor"" and above categories. ""At other places, restrictions are optional for the authorities but if there are more stringent measures under orders of the authorities, the same will prevail,"" the NGT had said. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had on Wednesday ordered closure of hot mix plants and stone crushers in Delhi-NCR till November 17 in view of a likely increase in pollution levels during the festive season. It also asked the governments of Punjab and Haryana to take immediate stringent actions to curb stubble burning and authorities in Delhi-NCR to strictly check biomass burning.

Authorities in New Delhi launched an anti-pollution campaign on Monday in an attempt to curb air pollution levels ahead of winter, when the capital is regularly covered in toxic haze, and warned that filthy air could make the coronavirus pandemic more dangerous. Delhi on Saturday recorded 'very poor' and 'severe' air quality at several places, as the national capital continues to remain engulfed in a blanket of smog. According to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) data today, the Air Quality Index (AQI) was at 424 (severe) in Anand Vihar, at 328 (very poor) in IGI Airport area, 400 (very poor) in ITO, and 354 (very poor) in RK Puram.

According to experts, the severe category affects the health of people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases. India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that the Air Quality Index (AQI) of the national capital is expected to go in the 'severe' category on Diwali. ""Presently Delhi's Air Quality is very poor and is expected to go worse to severe on Diwali. It can be worse if there are additional emissions.

""During this period the meteorological conditions are not favourable for good dispersion of air pollutants and further there will be little additional emission from firecrackers and traffic. Although the government has taken a lot of steps to control air pollution, still these external emissions will impact negatively,"" he added. In a bid to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic from worsening owing to poor air quality, the National Green Tribunal imposed a total ban on the sale and use of firecrackers in the National Capital Region from midnight of November 9 to midnight of November 30.

The association put forth a nine-step solution model before the government. It urged the government to induct 200 CNG and electric city busses up to last mile connectivity in every big city on priority and restrict tempo and autos to arterial roads. This will lead to minimal use of personal vehicles by commuters automatically, it said. This comes in the light of the spike in air pollution in Delhi and adjoining states like Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. The situation has become grave due to the wrath of the coronavirus pandemic, which reportedly gets aggravated by the pollution. The confederation said, ""The government could have taken the right steps from 2013 onwards instead of hiding its failure under the garb of stubble burning."" ""Every industry is supposed to install and run an effluent treatment plant (ETP) for its liquid and air discharge. In reality, most industries dump their effluent into the ground by reverse boring within their premises by stealth,"" the confederation said. It added, ""Some of the industries have installed ETPs for show, they run them only during inspection. This happens with the tacit approval of the PCs. To break this nexus, let the civil society in each city be allowed to carry out surprise checks of ETPs."" The RWA body, headed by Rao VBJ Chelikani, urged the Union ministry to ask the local administration to adopt green cremation system as it would save about six crore plants annually. ""Since the 'kapal kriya' and other rituals can be performed as in conventional cremation, no one can raise a voice in the name of 'aastha' as against the electric crematorium. Two such units have been installed at the Hindon cremation yard in Ghaziabad,"" it said. Giving another solution, the confederation said that if 2,000 CCTV cameras are installed on the main roads passing through a city, the traffic will become smooth, accidents will reduce, jams will decrease. Traffic congestion increases vehicle emissions and degrades ambient air quality. Further, it asked the government to allow every district magistrate to decide one car free day per month. The idea of vertical gardening and e-waste collection centre was also put forth. ""A research from Mexico brings out that creepers covered on the facade of a four-story building can absorb 40 tonnes of toxic gas in a year. Can we not start raising creepers on the walls of fly overs and Metro lines followed by government buildings and private buildings? It neither requires space, nor budget nor amendment in the Constitution,"" it said. The confederation said that there should be sanitary land-fills instead of dumping grounds. ""Mumbai and Delhi have already burnt their hands by developing dumping grounds. Let there be sanitary landfills. It requires filing of solid waste in trenches and its daily consolidation and covering,"" it said. The confederation further said that unauthorised vehicles in north India and tractor trolleys carrying uncovered building material, which do not pay any road tax, should be banned for at least three months with immediate effect.

A spike in PM 2.5 in the wee hours of November 15 is likely in case of fire-related emissions, it said. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had on Wednesday ordered closure of hot mix plants and stone crushers in Delhi-NCR till November 17 in view of a likely increase in pollution levels during the festive season. It also asked the governments of Punjab and Haryana to take immediate stringent actions to curb stubble burning and authorities in Delhi-NCR to strictly check biomass burning.

Delhi CM Kejriwal says bio-decomposer trial a success, seeks help from states","Published : Nov 13, 2020 13:12 IST, Updated : Nov 13, 2020 16:37 IST","Delhi has blamed neighbouring states Punjab, Haryana for the air pollution due to stubble burning. Declaring that the Delhi government has succeeded in finding a solution to the menace of stubble burning, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said that the bio-decomposer trials have yielded the desired results. The solution, developed by the Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI), Pusa, dissolves farm stubble turning them into manure. Addressing the media during a virtual press conference, Kejriwal said that the Delhi government has tested the solution developed by IARI and that it has shown expected positive results. Also Read: Smog engulfs most of North India; Delhi's air quality continues to be 'severe' The CM said that the bio-decomposer turns the farm residues into manure within 20 days after use. Underlining that the chemical will be of great help in addressing the issue of air pollution in Delhi due to stubble burning in neighbouring states like Punjab and Haryana, Kejriwal appealed state governments to work together to fight the problem. ""Delhi has succeeded in testing the bio-decomposer technique which turns stubble into manure. Now, state governments should help farmers to adopt this,"" Kejriwal said. The Delhi CM said that the government tested the product on 2,000 acres of agricultural lands and the results were as per the expectation. Every year, during the months of October to December, Delhi turns into a gas chamber primarily due to stubble (parali) burning by farmers of Punjab and Haryana. The national capital's air quality oscillates between poor to hazardous for weeks during the season. Despite the Supreme Court taking a hard stance over the issue and reprimanding both the Centre and Delhi government, no solution has been reached so far.

Five of these air quality monitoring stations will come up in Agra, one each in Mathura and Firozabad, two each in Lucknow and Kanpur besides three each in Varanasi and Prayagraj. One station will also be set up in Gorakhpur. The development comes as air pollution across different north Indian states is at an all time high. Commenting on the act, UPPCB regional officer (Prayagraj) Pradeep Kumar Vishwakarma said at present, the state has 25 Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations in 13 cities, including four each in Ghaziabad, Lucknow and Noida, three in Meerut, two in Greater Noida, besides one each in Agra, Baghpat, Bulandshahr, Hapur, Kanpur, Moradabad, Muzaffarnagar and Varanasi. All 18 new air quality monitoring stations would be set up on land provided by the UPPCB. Five of them would come up with funds provided by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and 10 from funds provided by the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP). The one in Gorakhpur would be set up through the UPPCB's own resources, he said. The UPPCB member-secretary, on behalf of the board, has already invited international bids for these high-end 24x7 monitoring stations, which would be connected to a data centre which will come up at the UPPCB headquarters in Lucknow and provide real-time data regarding the Air Quality Index (AQI) at any given moment. Vishwakarma added that the plan was to award a single bidder the responsibility of ""supply, installation and commissioning"" of all 18 air quality monitoring stations in these eight cities. They would have to depute one technician at each site to manage it besides a project officer and a data processor. The responsibility of managing these stations would be awarded to the bidder for a period of five years. As part of the initiative, one daylight and night visible data display system will also be installed near the station to display air quality readings. AQI is a tool for effective communication of air quality status to people in terms which are easy to understand. It transforms complex air quality data of various pollutants into a single number (index value), nomenclature and colour. There are six AQI categories, namely good, satisfactory, moderately polluted, poor, very poor and severe. Each of these categories is decided based on ambient concentration values of air pollutants and their likely health impacts, known as health breakpoints.

The Sector-6 intersection is the busiest road, often with a large amount of traffic. In addition, anti-smog guns have been installed at about 30 under-construction sites. Noida Authority CEO Ritu Maheshwari gave this information. The anti-smog gun mounted on Noida Sector-6 is operated from 9:30 a.m. to 1.30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. in the evening. Actually, pollution levels in Noida city have been in the dangerous category since last week. An anti-smog gun has been installed at a Sector-6 to prevent dust blowing from traffic. To overcome the situation, a survey is also being conducted in the city that anti-smog guns can be installed in other places like Sector-6. According to the information, soon anti-smog guns will be installed in about 10 busiest places in the city. OSD Avinash Tripathi at Noida Authority told IANS, ""As of November 10, there were 27 anti-smog guns installed in Noida.

On November 9, the National Green Tribunal had imposed a blanket ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region till November 30. The direction also applies to cities and towns where air quality during November fell to 'poor' and above categories. In 2019, however, even though the Delhi Government had organized four days of laser shows to convince the residents to choose life over firecrackers, the morning after Diwali, the city's air quality had turned worse than 2018. With the spike in air pollution in Delhi-NCR, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has ordered closing of hot mix plants and stone crushers till November 17 and also asked Punjab and Haryana to take stringent actions to curb stubble burning. Meanwhile, Delhi's air quality index stood at 318 micrograms per cubic meter at noon, as against 476 on Tuesday. ""Thanks to the winds from East, Delhi pollution has reduced. The AQI of most places is now less than 400. Many areas are less than 300,"" said Mahesh Palawat, from private weather forecasting agency Skymet Weather. He added, ""Easterly winds are blocking the smoke from stubble burning. Waiting for rain on November 15,"" said Palawat. The improvement of air quality will be short lived. According to the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, under the aegis of the ministry, the air quality is likely to deteriorate marginally at night. It may deteriorate further but remain in a very poor category on November 13 and 14, the day Diwali will be celebrated. ""Under zero firecracker scenarios, the level of PM2.5 is likely to be the lowest in the past four years as not so calm surface winds in Delhi will help in dispersion,"" the ministry said. However, stubble burning-induced impact on AQI is expected to increase from negligible to moderate for the next two days. There will be a spike in PM2.5 in the wee hours of November 15 due to fire-related emissions, it added. ""The biomass plume transport-level winds are now north-westerly and will have high potential to transport biomass plume in the next three days but the expected moderate surface winds in Delhi will not allow rapid accumulation of pollutants for a longer period."" The ministry further stated, ""The moderate easterly boundary layer winds are likely on 15th and 16th November. Isolated rainfall under the influence of fresh western disturbance by 16th November is also expected."" These two factors will help in flushing out the impact of any additional emissions and biomass related impact to make AQI in the lower end of very poor by late November 16.

A change in the wind direction -- from north westerly to north-north easterly -- was the reason behind the dip in pollution levels as it reduced the contribution of stubble burning significantly, according to government agencies and weather experts. The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 315 at 9 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 344 on Wednesday and 476 on Tuesday. Delhi witnessed six “severe” air days on the trot from November 4 to November 9, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. The AQI in neighbouring cities of Faridabad (306), Ghaziabad (336), Noida (291), Greater Noida (322), and Gurgaon (261), which fall in the National Capital Region (NCR), was also recorded in the “poor” and ""very poor"" categories. An official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the “situation is much better compared to Tuesday”. The wind direction has changed preventing the transport of smoke from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana, he said. The official, however, said the air quality is likely to deteriorate marginally on Friday. The IMD said winds were calm in the morning and the minimum temperature was 11.6 degrees Celsius. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. There was shallow fog in the morning and the visibility was 800 metres at the Safdarjung Observatory. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the change in transport level wind direction has led to a significant decrease in stubble burning-related intrusion in spite of high fire counts. The share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 was almost negligible -- 3 per cent -- on Wednesday due to unfavourable transport-level winds, it said. “Deterioration (in air quality) is expected on Friday towards the higher end of the 'very poor' category,” it said. The CPCB had on Wednesday ordered the closure of hot mix plants and stone crushers in Delhi-NCR till November 17 in view of a likely increase in pollution levels during the festive season. It also asked the governments of Punjab and Haryana to take immediate stringent actions to curb stubble burning and authorities in Delhi-NCR to strictly check biomass burning.

Delhi recorded a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 476, which falls in the ""severe"" category. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (448), Ghaziabad (444), Noida (455), Greater Noida (436) and Gurgaon (427), which fall in the National Capital Region (NCR), also recorded ""severe"" air quality. It was the sixth ""severe"" air day on the trot in Delhi. The city witnessed seven ""severe"" air days in November last year. The levels of PM2.5 -- which is about three per cent the diameter of a human hair and can lead to premature deaths from heart and lung diseases -- were 494 µg/m3 at 5 pm, more than eight times the safe limit of 60 µg/m3. The PM10 levels stood at 600 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) at 5 pm, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India. According to the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), the air quality is considered to be in the ""severe plus"" or ""emergency"" category if the PM2. 5 and PM10 levels persist above 300 µg/m3 and 500 µg/m3 respectively for more than 48 hours. The GRAP recommends measures such as a ban on construction activities and entry of trucks, and a car-rationing scheme in such a scenario. In the morning, the air quality monitoring stations at Mandir Marg, Punjabi Bagh, Pusa, Rohini, Patparganj, Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Najafgarh, Sri Aurobindo Marg and Okhla Phase 2 maxed out as their readings hit the 500-mark, the CPCB data showed. According to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), the PM10 concentration soared to 1,482 µg/m3 at Bawana, 1,800 µg/m3 at Jahangirpuri, 1,291 µg/m3 at Wazirpur and 1,471 at Punjabi Bagh. The smog reduced visibility to merely 300 metres in the morning, affecting traffic, an India Meteorological Department (IMD) official said. The city recorded calm winds and a minimum temperature of 10.7 degrees Celsius on Tuesday morning. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while a favourable wind speed helps in their dispersal. The Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas tasked the CPCB on Tuesday with operationalising and monitoring GRAP measures till a mechanism is set up by the newly-formed panel. At a meeting, the commission also decided that in view of the deteriorating air quality in the NCR, there is a need to invoke the GRAP, which has already been notified by the Centre. A CPCB official said the pollution watchdog will hold a meeting on Wednesday and take appropriate measures. As the skies hung heavy and acrid over the region, people complained of an itchy throat and watery eyes. ""It is the same every year irrespective of what governments say or do. It feels like doomsday,"" Gaurav Rathi, a resident of Jangpura, said. Simran Vyas, a 54-year-old resident of Bhogal, complained of heaviness in the chest and wondered if a lockdown was the only solution to avoid this situation. Recently, the Indian Medical Association said pollution led to the rise of COVID-19 cases in Delhi by 13 per cent. According to an online survey with a sample size of 10,500, around 85 per cent households in Delhi, 62 per cent in Gurgaon, 68 per cent in Noida, 43 per cent in Ghaziabad and 66 per cent in Faridabad have ""either one or more individuals suffering from pollution-related ailments"". Government agencies and experts said the calm wind speeds are exacerbating the effect of stubble-burning and a ""quick recovery"" is not possible unless the number of farm fires reduces drastically. V K Soni, the head of the IMD's environment research centre, said a major improvement in Delhi-NCR's air quality is highly unlikely in the coming days. ""The air quality is likely to be recorded in the upper end of the 'very poor' category on Diwali if we discount firecracker emissions. If people burst crackers, pollution levels can increase to the 'severe' to 'severe plus' (emergency) category,"" he said. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the city is witnessing an ""unusual"" condition and no quick recovery is predicted from the ""severe"" air pollution. The central agency said three major factors are responsible for this situation -- secondary particle formation, extremely calm local surface winds and stubble-related intrusion. It said the farm fire count in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and neighbouring areas stood at 2,247. ""The number has marginally reduced but is still significantly high,"" it said. The share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was 22 per cent on Tuesday. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) imposed a total ban on Monday on the sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the NCR from the midnight of November 9 to the midnight of November 30, saying ""celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases"".

Professor Trisha Greenhalgh at the University of Oxford and colleagues said despite limited evidence, masks ""could have a substantial impact on transmission with a relatively small impact on social and economic life."" ""Masks are simple, cheap, and potentially effective. We believe that wearing both in the home (particularly by the person showing symptoms) and also outside the home in situations where meeting others is likely (for example, shopping, public transport), they could have a substantial impact on transmission with a relatively small impact on social and economic life,"" said researchers. In a recent study that was published in the journal 'Chemical and Engineering News' mentioned how researchers have connected air pollution to dementia, autism, and a few other neurological disorders. Outdoor air pollution has become a fact in our lives today. However, both in children and adults, short- and long-term exposure to air pollution may lead to reduced lung functioning, respiratory infection, and aggravated asthma. When a pregnant woman is exposed to air pollution it may pose severe threats like low birth weight, pre-term birth and small gestational air births. Recent studies have shown that there has been 11% rise in the COVID-19 deaths due to bad air quality. Therefore, to tackle both COVID-19 virus and the air pollution, one needs to wear a mask which is suitable for both. What are the suitable masks? Experts suggest that N95 masks which contain a respiratory valve should be used by the medical professionals who are at a greater risk of coming across germs. However, for normal use people can use a good-grade surgical or cloth mask that can help them keep pollution and COVID at a bay. It is recommended that you use disposable masks which properly cover your mouth and nose and are not loose. If you carry FFP1 masks they will be ideal as it can save you from the air pollution. Which masks are not suitable? N95 masks are not very good choice if used for long. They will neither be comfortable nor they will be of any use if you are not wearing them properly. Also, these days there are different kinds of masks available in the market to suit them with your dress. However, beware of the masks which have embriodery and sequins as they might have too many holes and the ones which have holes can be unsafe. On the other hand, people should also keep away from valved masks as they can be effective in saving you from the air pollution but can't save you from COVID-19 virus With inputs from IANS.

Keeping in mind the COVID-19 pandemic situation along with the further rise in  pollution level, health experts warned that respiratory cases may jump up, which can make the ongoing crisis even worst. Earlier, studies had shown that exposure to pollution increases your risk of lung cancer, heart attacks, stroke, and in extreme cases, premature death. According to the British Lung Foundation, there’s good evidence that outdoor air pollution contributes to lung cancer, and it’s also possible that long-term exposure to air pollution can lead to asthma. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, severe air pollution levels affects ‘healthy people’ and ‘seriously impacts’ those with existing diseases. Can you protect yourself? Yes. Limit the outdoor exercise Looking at the recent scenario, Health experts have warned to 'Limit the outdoor exercise'. Avoiding heavy outdoor activities is key when pollution levels are on the rise. For those desperate to meet step counts for the day, experts said walking indoors in the house or spot jogging and climbing up and down the stairs at home can be just as beneficial as walking thorough the park. Naturally, indoor gyms and at-home exercise machines are also healthy alternatives to outdoor workouts when air quality is bad. However, Portable air purifiers are also recommended. Experts said that one must keep a track of the AQI around their place before stepping out of their house. Online pollution tracking apps as well as local radio and TV weather reports are a good place to start. In addition to limiting outdoor play for children, try encouraging them to play indoor. Activities and games such as Chess, Ludo, Carrom board and UNO can be a great option to start with. Avoid smoking and wear masks Experts even warned to especially avoid cigarettes as it not only contribute to the already deteriorating situation of Air quality but can also harm your lungs. When outside, use well-fitted face masks. Eat Healthy Eating a healthy, balanced diet consisting of plenty of anti-inflammatory foods, Vitamins and Minerals can be a good option to prtect oneself from falling ill. These food items include leafy greens, beans, lentils, fruits, turmeric, dry fruits, green tea, ginger etc. Staying hydrated by drinking enough water, coconut water and juices are also recommended. Breathing in air pollutants can irritate airways, cause coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest pain, asthma episodes, and respiratory problems.

It said the Punjab government had notified the time restrictions on bursting of firecrackers during Diwali, Gurpurab, Christmas and New Year by issuing public notice in various newspaper through the State Pollution Control Board. ""In view of the above stated facts and after due consideration of the matter in the background of COVID-19 pandemic, it is respectfully apprised that ban on the use of fire crackers is not required in the state of Punjab,"" it said. The NGT was earlier informed that air pollution is an important co-factor increasing the risk of mortality from COVID-19 as per latest research. Senior advocate Raj Panjawani and advocate Shibhani Ghosh, who have been appointed by the tribunal as amicus curiae in a case related to ban on fire crackers, had told a bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice A K Goel that particulate air pollution contributed 15 per cent to COVID-19 mortality worldwide. ""The latest research on exposure to air pollution and risk of death from COVID-19 infection suggests that 'air pollution is an important cofactor increasing the risk of mortality from COVID-19',"" they said. ""The study also states that this finding should provide 'extra motivation for combining ambitious policies to reduce air pollution with measures to control the transmission of COVID- 19'. The study estimates that particulate air pollution contributed 15 per cent to COVID-19 mortality worldwide,"" they added.

The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) air lab, which was installed a few days ago to monitor the pollution levels across the Millennium City, have identified 18 most polluted locations on Friday. These 18 places are: Sector 14, Sector 18, Sector 30, Sector 32, Sector 42, Sector 44, Sector 47, Sector 51, Atlas Chowk, Shankar Chowk, Huda City Centre, Teri Retreat, Teri Gram, Manesar, Vikas Sadarn, DLF Belvedere Towers, Vatika Chowk and Gwal Pahari. With the pollution level deteriorating, an alert was issued a few days ago by the Gurugram administration for Covid patients, children and senior citizens asking them to stay indoors. In western India, in Mumbai, Pune and Ahmedabad, the situation is fairly better. The air quality of Pune is the higher end of the Satisfactory category and Mumbai, and Ahmedabad is in the Moderate category. Pune AQI is likely to marginally deteriorate and stay in the Moderate for the next three days. Mumbai and Ahmedabad AQI is forecast to stay in the Moderate to Poor category for the next three days. The health officials in Delhi-NCR have claimed that due to worsening air quality, the number of patients with eye infections and other ailments have increased. The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) of Gurugram has been in force since October 15. A team of the MCG has levied a fine of Rs 29 lakh on the violators, but it has had little effect.

Experts said while meteorological conditions were “moderately” favourable for dispersion of pollutants, a “very high” number of farm fires in Punjab was the primary reason for the “severe” air quality on Friday. The city's 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) stood at 406. On Thursday, the AQI was 450, the highest since November 15 last year, when it was 458. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida and Gurugram also recorded “very poor” to “severe” air quality. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"", 201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe"". PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 435 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 6 pm, according to CPCB data.
PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India. PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers and is inhalable into the lungs.
These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores.
 
The levels of PM2.5 – finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream – were 242 µg/m3 at 6 pm. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.
 
According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum wind speed was 10 kilometres per hour on Friday and the minimum temperature 11.2 degrees Celsius. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. V K Soni, the head of IMD's environment monitoring research centre, said, “The air quality was in the 'very poor' category on Friday morning. It entered the 'severe' zone again by evening, with a very large number of farm fires over Punjab being the primary reason”. He said the boundary layer wind direction was north-northwesterly, favourable for the transport of pollutants from farm fires to Delhi-NCR. The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the farm fire count in Punjab (around 5,100) remained “very high” on Thursday and it is likely to impact the air quality of Delhi-NCR and other parts of northwest India. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was estimated at 21 percent on Friday. It was 42 percent on Thursday, the maximum this season so far. Last year, the stubble contribution to Delhi's pollution had peaked to 44 percent on November 1, according to SAFAR data. Health experts said during the COVID-19 pandemic, air pollution has become a serious health concern for about the two crore residents of the national capital. According to a doctor at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, intake of every 22 micrograms per cubic metre of polluted air is equivalent to smoking a cigarette. With Delhi witnessing a spike in the number of new COVID-19 cases amid worsening pollution levels, the Delhi government on Thursday announced a blanket ban on firecrackers from November 7 to November 30. Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said those violating the ban on firecrackers can be fined up to Rs 1 lakh by the administration TOP NEWS Punjab: 'Bhagwant Mann Sarkar Tuhade Dwar' scheme benefits over 8 lakh people across state Sunny Deol's much-awaited pan-India film 'Jaat' locks its release date | Check new poster ICC announces ODI Team of 2024, no Indian on list LATEST NEWS Punjab: 'Bhagwant Mann Sarkar Tuhade Dwar' scheme benefits over 8 lakh people across state Mumbai: 20-year-old woman allegedly raped by auto driver, blade and stones found in private part BSNL rolls out over 65000 4G towers, superfast connectivity for millions Sunny Deol's much-awaited pan-India film 'Jaat' locks its release date | Check new poster © 2009-2025 Independent News Service.

Top officials of the Union environment and health ministries and the governments of Delhi, Haryana and Punjab deposed before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Urban Development to find a ""permanent solution"" to air pollution in the national capital and adjoining areas. In addition, officials of the Central Pollution Control Board and from other departments also depose before the panel on the ongoing situation of air pollution in the national capital and its adjoining areas. The agenda of the meeting was to deliberate upon ""steps taken for prevention of air pollution special emphasis on finding permanent solution to air pollution in Delhi and NCR. ""
In a presentation before the panel, officials from the central government expressed concern over the threat of COVID-19 spreading faster due to air pollution. ""Higher air pollution may increase episodes of coughing and sneezing spreading COVID-19 faster.
More particle surface for the virus to stick to and get transported over greater distance and may potentially survive longer,"" the health ministry said in the presentation to the committee. Citing a Lancet study, the health ministry said, ""There is average loss of 1.

""
Similarly it said in Delhi there is 1.
7 times higher risk of respiratory ailments and prevalence of breathing problems and 10,000 to 30,000 air pollution deaths are reported annually. The environment ministry, in its presentation, shared the details of the status of air quality of Delhi during four years between 2016 and 2019. As per the presentation, the quality of Delhi air was good for only four days during this period and was very poor for 319 days. And the quality of air in Delhi was severe for 78 days. Delhi's air quality on Thursday dropped to its worst level since December 2019 with farm fires accounting for 42 per cent of its pollution, the maximum this season so far, according to data from central government agencies. Experts said unfavourable meteorological conditions -- calm winds and low temperatures -- and smoke from farm fires in neighbouring states led to a dense layer of haze on Wednesday night as the air quality index entered the 'severe' category. The haze thinned on Thursday with higher wind speed helping in dispersion of pollutants.
However, the 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 450, the highest since December 30 last year, when it was 446. All the 36 monitoring stations in Delhi recorded air quality in the 'severe' category. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Gurgaon and Noida also recorded 'severe' air pollution.

Diwali, one of the most awaited Indian festivals, is just around the corner as people prepare to celebrate it in their own vibrant ways. The festival that brings much needed positivity in peoples' lives, it also brings a lot of pollution due to burning of the fire crackers. Especially, in the northern states of the country which faces a double dose of air pollution due to stubble burning added with fire crackers. Therefore, in order to ensure that air quality doesn't worsen during this fall, several states banned the use of fire crackers ahead of the festival. While a couple of states have already announced the ban on fire crackers, others may follow the suit too. Here's the list of states where fire crackers have already been banned. The Calcutta High Court had banned the use and sale of firecrackers in Kali Puja and Diwali, keeping in mind the Covid-19 pandemic situation in West Bengal. Earlier, a public interest litigation (PIL) was filed in the Calcutta High Court with regard to banning firecrackers during Kali Puja and Diwali in the state. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal decided to ban firecrackers, as both pollution and coronavirus are adversely impacting city residents. ""The Delhi government has decided to put a complete ban on the sale, purchase, and use of firecrackers in Delhi from November 7 to November 30,"" Delhi government said in an order. The BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation on November 5 announced that it will ban bursting or lighting of all fire-crackers at public places during the upcoming Diwali festival. Additional Municipal Commissioner Suresh Kakani said that any violators shall be penalized and the SOPs in this regard would be issued shortly. The ban has been proposed in view of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the early winter that has set in. Chandigarh Chandigarh has also banned the sale and use of firecrackers of all types with immediate effect, until further orders. ALSO READ | Diwali Cheers!

The research, published in the journal Science Advances, investigated the impact of long-term exposure to PM 2.5 pollutants -- tiny particles in the air that are two and one half microns or less in width -- on COVID-19 mortality rates in 3089 counties in the US, ""covering 98 per cent of the population."" It found that ""higher historical exposure"" to these particulate pollutants is associated with greater county-level COVID-19 mortality rates after accounting for several area-level risk factors. While the study could not provide insights into the mechanism underlying the relationship, the scientists, including those from Harvard University in the US, believe chronic exposure to PM 2.5 may cause over production of the ACE-2 receptor in the lungs, which the novel coronavirus uses to enter host cells. They believe the prolonged exposure to air pollution may also impair people's immune system. ""Chronic exposure to PM2.5 causes alveolar ACE-2 receptor overexpression and impairs host defences. This could cause a more severe form of COVID-19 in ACE-2–depleted lungs, increasing the likelihood of poor outcomes, including death,"" the scientists wrote in the study. Citing the limitations of the study, the scientists said they were unable to adjust for individual-level risk factors such as age, race, and smoking status as such data were unavailable. ""This approach leaves us unable to make conclusions regarding individual-level associations,"" the scientists said. However, the researchers said the analyses provide strong justification for follow-up investigations as more and higher-quality COVID-19 data become available. ""Research on how modifiable factors may exacerbate COVID-19 symptoms and increase mortality risk is essential to guide policies and behaviours to minimize fatality related to the pandemic,"" they noted in the research.

In a veiled attack, without naming Haryana and Punjab, Kejriwal said the ""neighbouring state governments have done nothing to provide relief to the farmers, because of which the farmers are forced to burn stubble"". The Delhi CM's remarks came after he visited the Hiranki Village in outer Delhi's Narela constituency to inspect the efficacy of the bio-decomposing solution developed under the guidance of the PUSA Institute and sprayed by the Delhi government on farmlands across the national capital. Kejriwal said that the bio-decomposing process of converting stubble into manure is a success, which shows that Delhi has provided a cheap and effective alternative for stubble burning to other states. Kejriwal said that the neighbouring states, where the practice of stubble burning is prevalent, should implement the alternative without any excuses. He also said that farmers are highly distressed due to the absence of alternatives to stubble burning, due to which they are left with no option but to burn stubble and bear the brunt of pollution. ""Every year, the smoke from stubble burning pollutes Delhi. The media reports and satellite images show that the practice of stubble burning is quite prevalent in the neighbouring states of Delhi, especially Punjab,"" Kejriwal said, while addressing the media. ""On one hand, the farmers are themselves very troubled because their families and the villages have to bear the brunt of pollution. The neighbouring state governments have done nothing to provide relief to the farmers, because of which the farmers are forced to burn stubble which leads to major pollution across northern India."" Kejriwal said the Delhi government had sprayed the bio-decomposer solution on farmlands across Delhi on October 13. ""Today is November 4, the entire stubble has converted into manure and the fields are ready for sowing again. Delhi, along with the PUSA Institute, has given a cheap and effective alternative to stubble burning."" Kejriwal said he hope that this is the last year when ""we have to suffer from pollution"". ""No government can make any excuse; they should stop agonising their farmers. I have spoken to several farmers in Punjab and Haryana, and I know that they do not want to burn stubble anymore. We would present this alternative in front of the Supreme Court owing to the effectiveness of this alternative,"" Kejriwal said. ""The farmers and the scientists of the PUSA Institute are very satisfied with the output of the solution. No government can make an excuse that they have no alternative or solution to the problem of stubble burning, because a very cheap alternative is available."" The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor said his government has sprayed the solution across Delhi in just Rs 20 lakhs.

The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said ""fire counts"" reduced in Punjab (around 2,400) on Tuesday, but were ""still significantly high and are likely to impact the air quality in Delhi-NCR and northwest India"". The share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution had dropped to 10 per cent on Tuesday due to a change in the wind direction. The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 279 at 10 am as wind speed picked up. The 24-hour average AQI was 302 on Tuesday. It was 293 on Monday and 364 on Sunday. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ""good"", 51 and 100 ""satisfactory"", 101 and 200 ""moderate"",201 and 300 ""poor"", 301 and 400 ""very poor"", and 401 and 500 ""severe"". According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the share of stubble burning accounted for 16 per cent of Delhi's pollution on Monday and 40 per cent on Sunday, the maximum so far this season. It was 32 per cent on Saturday, 19 per cent on Friday and 36 per cent on Thursday. Last year, the farm fire contribution to Delhi's pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data. According to the India Meteorological Department, the maximum wind speed was 15 kilometers per hour on Wednesday. The city recorded a minimum temperature of 10.6 degrees Celsius. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. According to the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the city's ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was expected to be around 9,5000 metre square per second on Wednesday – favourable for dispersion of pollutants. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.

A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice A K Goel sought response from MoEF, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Delhi Pollution Control Committee, Police Commissioner of Delhi and the governments of Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The NGT also appointed senior advocate Raj Panjwani and advocate  Shibhani Ghosh to assist it as amicus curiae in the matter. The tribunal was hearing a plea by Indian Social Responsibility Network, filed through Santosh Gupta, seeking action against pollution by use of fire crackers in NCR during the time air quality is unsatisfactory with potential of severity of COVID-19 pandemic. The application referred to the statement of the Union Health Minister and the Health Minister of Delhi that during festive season there will be rise of COVID-19 cases due to air pollution. “Increased pollution may further affect the vulnerable groups and increase the fatality rate. COVID-19 cases in Delhi may go up to 15,000 per day, as against the current cases of about 5,000 per day. “Use of green crackers will not remedy the situation.

Normally, the Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, records a minimum of 15 to 16 degrees Celsius in the first week of November. The mercury dips to 11-12 degrees Celsius by the last week of November, it said. Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of IMD, said the absence of cloud cover was the major reason for the low minimum temperature. Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground. Another reason is calm winds, which allow formation of mist and fog, Srivastava said.
 
There hasn't been much snowfall in the hills, so cold winds from that region are yet to start affecting Delhi's weather, he added. The month of October was the coolest in 58 years in the national capital, according to IMD.
   
The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962, when it was 16. 9 degrees Celsius, it said. Normally, Delhi records a mean minimum temperature of 19.1 degrees Celsius in October. The city recorded a mean minimum temperature of 17.5 degrees Celsius in October 2007, according to IMD.
 
On Thursday, Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 12.5 degrees Celsius -- the lowest in October in 26 years. The last time Delhi recorded such a low temperature in October was in 1994. The national capital had recorded a minimum of 12.3 degrees Celsius on October 31, 1994, according to IMD data.
 
The city recorded the all-time lowest temperature (9.4 degrees Celsius) on October 31, 1937, Srivastava said.

It was 19 per cent on Friday and 36 per cent on Thursday -- the maximum so far this season. The fire count increased to an unusual high on Friday over Punjab (approx 4,266), Haryana (155), Uttar Pradesh (51) and Madhya Pradesh (381) impacting air quality in Delhi-NCR and other parts of northwest India, Central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said. NASA's satellite imagery showed a large, dense cluster of fire dots covering Punjab and parts of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. SAFAR said Delhi's AQI did not improve much despite better ventilation, mainly because of highly favourable north-north westerly boundary level wind direction and perfect wind speed for intrusion of pollutants from farm fires. “Increased local surface wind speed with faster dispersion conditions are counteracting with increased fire-related emission and associated intrusion. But still, AQI is likely to improve for the next two days as dispersion will eventually play a lead role,” it said. According to the India Meteorological Department, the predominant wind direction was northwesterly and the maximum wind speed was 15 kilometres per hour on Sunday.
 
Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. The city's ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was expected to be around 8,500 metre square per second on Sunday – favourable for dispersion of pollutants. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air.
It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.

It was 297 on Wednesday, 312 on Tuesday, 353 on Monday, 349 on Sunday, 345 on Saturday, and 366 on Friday. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' monitoring agency, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was 36 per cent on Thursday - the maximum so far this season. The slow speed of air has led to the accumulation of pollutants in the atmosphere. Also, stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana is affecting the Delhi-NCR. Earlier on Thursday, satellite images from NASA showed a thick cover of smoke over the Delhi-NCR region. According to CPCB, an AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate',201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.

The Ministry of Earth Sciences' monitoring agency, SAFAR, said the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was 36 per cent on Thursday - the maximum so far this season. Delhi recorded a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 395. It was 297 on Wednesday, 312 on Tuesday, 353 on Monday, 349 on Sunday, 345 on Saturday and 366 on Friday. Most of the monitoring stations, including at Shadipur (421), Patparganj (418), Bawana (453) and Mundka (427), recorded air quality in the ""severe"" category. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate',201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. A senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the wind speed dipped on Wednesday which allowed accumulation of pollutants. ""Following slight relief, the air quality again entered the very poor category by the evening,"" he said. The AQI entered the ""severe"" category for a brief period in the afternoon before slipping back into the ""very poor"" category. PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 424 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 10 am - the highest this season so far, according to CPCB data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India. PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers and is inhalable into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores. The levels of PM2.5 – finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream – were 231 µg/m3.PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe. NASA's satellite imagery showed a large, dense cluster of fires that covered most parts of Punjab and some regions of Haryana. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 concentration was 36 per cent on Thursday. It was 18 per cent on Wednesday, 23 per cent on Tuesday, 16 per cent on Monday, 19 per cent on Sunday and 9 per cent on Saturday. SAFAR said accumulation of locally generated pollutants and increased external intrusion due to north-north westerly boundary level winds from regions where stubble is burnt were the major factors for the increase in PM2.5 levels. ""Extremely calm surface and boundary layer winds along with the low nighttime boundary layer height resulted in low ventilation… practically stagnant, no dispersion condition has resulted in the current situation,"" it said. An increase in surface wind speed and better ventilation conditions are likely to ""significantly"" improve the situation by Saturday, SAFAR said. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the predominant wind direction was northerly and the maximum wind speed was 8 kilometers per hour. The minimum temperature was recorded at 12.5 degrees Celsius - the lowest in October in 26 years. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. The city's ventilation index - a product of mixing depth and average wind speed - was around 4,000 meter square per second on Wednesday - unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. The Centre introduced a new law through an ordinance that put in place a powerful oversight body to curb air pollution. Under the ordinance released by the Union ministry of law and justice on Thursday, the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) has been dissolved and replaced by a commission comprising over 20 members. The Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas will have the power to lay down parameters of air quality, inspect premises violating the law, ordering closure of non-abiding industries/plants among others.

The notification by the Ministry of Law and Justice said an ordinance will provide for the constitution of a commission for better coordination, research, identification and resolution of problems surrounding the air quality index. The quality of air in NCR and adjoining areas remains a cause of concern and it has become necessary to evolve and implement a consolidated approach for monitoring, tackling and eliminating the causes of air pollution and identifying, specifying and rigorously enforcing measures for elimination and mitigation of air pollution including but not limited to controlling or eliminating the activities of stubble burning, vehicular pollution, road dust and urban construction. The notification said that the committee set up under the Environmental Protection Act 1986 has taken measures to deal with the menace of air pollution in NCR but air quality remains a concern on account of the lack of a statutory mechanism for vigorous implantation of the various measures. While the courts have set up committees to aid and assist the implementation of the orders, it is now considered necessary to have a statutory authority with appropriate powers and charged with the duty of taking comprehensive measures to tackle air pollution on a war footing with power to coordinate with relevant states and the Central government and issue directions to statutory authorities under various laws. The notification says it is necessary to have a consolidated and conjoint approach in monitoring, tackling and researching air pollution caused due to several factors. India is committed to create a clean environment and pollution free air as mandated in the Constitution of India. In place of the ad hoc measures and to provide a permanent solution, a Commission is being set up. The Ordinance seeks to provide a broad based Central commission for monitoring air pollution, enforcing laws and research and development. Adjoining areas would mean the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan adjoining the NCT of Delhi where any source of pollution can be located causing adverse impact on air quality in NCR. It will be a broad-based commission consisting of a chairperson, a representative of the Environment Ministry and representatives of the states among several other members.

The Delhi government is all set to launch the 'Red Light On, Gaadi Off' campaign in all the 272 wards here from November 2 in a move to reduce pollution in the national capital. Motivating residents to participate in the campaign, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday urged people to prompt five of their peers, friends or acquaintances to play their part in reducing city's pollution by switching their vehicles off while waiting at the traffic signals. Announcing that the campaign will be launched in all the 272 wards in Delhi from November 2, the minister said the campaign can reduce around 15-20 per cent pollution in Delhi. While participating in the campaign near Delhi Gate near Darya Ganj in Central Delhi, Rai said the Delhi government has deployed environment marshals at all traffic signal crossings across Delhi.

According to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee data, the Air Quality Index is at 313 in Anand Vihar, 305 in RK Puram, 325 in Mundka and 309 in Patparganj; all four in 'very poor' category. An AQI between 0and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate',201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. A senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department said favourable wind speed helped in the dispersion of pollutants on Tuesday evening. However, the wind speed has reduced again which will allow pollutants to accumulate, he said. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 concentration rose to 23 per cent on Tuesday, the maximum this season so far. It was 16 per cent on Monday, 19 per cent on Sunday and 9 per cent on Saturday. The wind direction and wind speed were favourable for the transport of pollutants from farm fires in Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring regions on Tuesday. The number of farm fires in neighbouring states was 1,943 on Monday – the highest so far this season, SAFAR said. According to the India Meteorological Department, the predominant wind direction was westerly-northwesterly and the maximum wind speed was 4 kilometers per hour. The minimum temperature was recorded at 13.8 degrees Celsius. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. The air quality index (AQI) is likely to improve slightly on Wednesday but pollution levels will rise again on Thursday, SAFAR said. The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the national capital's air quality was likely to remain “very poor” till October 31. The air quality warning system said the ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – is likely to be around 4,000 metre square per second on Wednesday – unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. Meanwhile, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will launch 'Green Delhi' mobile application on Thursday, using which citizens can bring pollution-causing activities to the government's notice, Environment Minister Gopal Rai said on Tuesday. There will be a deadline to address complaints and the chief minister will get a daily report about resolved and pending grievances.

415,IndiaTV News,https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/air-pollution-coronavirus-fight-may-hamper-delhi-smog-scientists-says-660020,"Air pollution may hamper India's fight against coronavirus, say scientists","Published : Oct 26, 2020 18:43 IST, Updated : Oct 26, 2020 18:50 IST","Morning haze envelops the skyline on the outskirts of New Delhi. The national capital, one of the world’s most polluted cities, enjoyed a respite from air pollution up until September due to a strict virus lockdown. But now with the onset of winter leading to the dying down of winds and industrial activities resuming and cars back on the roads, the air quality in the city has once again fallen to poor levels. The causal link between air pollution and coronavirus cases is yet to be established conclusively but long-term exposure will certainly make people more vulnerable to lung infections, warn scientists as the skies over large parts of north India, including Delhi, turn smoky and the air quality deteriorates rapidly. Their concerns come amid several global studies pointing to the possible connection between higher air pollution levels and increased COVID-19 cases and deaths. A study by researchers at Harvard University in the US in September showed that an increase of only one microgram per cubic metre in PM 2. 5 is associated with an 8 per cent increase in the COVID-19 death rate. ""Given the current limited literature, the surge of PM2.5 level in Delhi may be associated with increased COVID-19 cases... Although the literature is relatively sparse at this stage,” Xiao Wu, corresponding author of the Harvard study, told PTI. He said the relationship between long-term air pollution and COVID-19 has been documented in many studies, which indicate that adverse health impacts of air pollution can make people prone to the infection or exacerbate the severity of COVID-19 symptoms once infected. This is interesting, especially considering COVID-19 causes viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and severe inflammation to the heart and circulatory system, the scientist said. Another study by the University of Cambridge in April found an association between living in an area of England with high levels of air pollution and the severity of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. “Based on our findings, I would expect to see an association between higher levels of air pollution in India and COVID-19 in the winter, similar with what we found in England,” said Marco Travaglio, corresponding author of the Cambridge study. “If the levels of air pollution have been consistently above the legal limits for several months or years before this coming winter, I would expect to see a relationship between those levels and COVID-19 burden across different parts of India in November and thereafter,” Travaglio told PTI. He noted that a key component of PM2.5 toxicity is its composition which may vary considerably between countries. “Nonetheless, the WHO legal limits for PM2.5 are currently set at 10 μg/m³ (microgrammes per cubic metre) annual mean. Levels beyond 500 μg/m³ are extremely high and may have considerable impact on people’s health in relation to COVID-19 but also beyond it,” said Travalgo. The level of small particulate matter (PM2.5) levels in Delhi have averaged around 180-340 μg/m³ in the past few weeks while that of bigger pollution particles (PM10) has hovered between 120 and 450 during the time. Long-term exposure to chronically high PM2.5 levels weakens the ability of the lungs to fend off infections, therefore making people more susceptible to COVID-19, the scientists said. In addition, studies from Italy have shown that traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, the genetic material of the virus, can be found on pollution particles, meaning that increased air pollution may act as a vehicle to increase COVID-19 transmission in highly polluted places. The air quality in north India is expected to deteriorate further from November to February due to several factors such as stubble burning, festive fireworks and low wind speed conditions which lead to an uptick in vehicular and industrial pollution being trapped in the lower atmosphere. ""In view of this evidence, high levels of PM2.5 in Delhi may lead to a higher number of COVID-19 cases,” Travalgo added. Studies in humans have shown that toxic air particles can penetrate airways and cause widespread infiltration of lung cells. This chronic state of inflammation may induce or aggravate health conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, experts said. Because these conditions have been widely found to be associated with increased risk of contracting COVID-19 or incurring into critical illness, it is likely that air pollution acts as a risk factor to increase the susceptibility to COVID-19. India has the world's second-highest caseload of over 7.9 million and the third-highest death toll with more than 115,000 from the novel coronavirus. The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has warned that Delhi is likely to report around 15,000 COVID-19 cases daily in winter because of the prevalence of respiratory illnesses during this season that worsen the symptoms of the disease. On Sunday, the national capital recorded 4,136 fresh COVID-19 cases, the highest single-day spike in 38 days. DJ Christopher, head of pulmonary medicine at the Christian Medical College in Tamil Nadu, noted that the increased severe form of COVID-19 among patients would lead to an increased ICU hospitalisations, thereby increasing the burden of the healthcare system. “The lung is the gateway to the body and takes the first impact from inhaled pollutants. It causes an inflammatory response which damages the lung and makes it more susceptible to infections,” Christopher told PTI. 'Let us hope the numbers are not so high. There is a chance of hospital beds getting filled and shortage of ICU beds,“ he added. Prof Rajneesh Bhardwaj concurred, saying there is growing scientific evidence that airborne respiratory droplets carrying the virus travel and contaminate the air after an infected person coughs. He added that pollution may help this airborne droplet to remain suspended for a longer time and may increase the spread of COVID-19. “PM2.5 are finer particles which remain suspended in the air for a long time and hence droplet or viral particles can cling on to these particles to increase the risk. They may increase the number of cases as pollution increases especially with large PM2. 5 levels,"" Bhardwaj, associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay, told PTI. He said the government should make contingent plans to deal with an expected large number of cases and warned that any healthcare system can be overwhelmed by a larger number of cases. According to pulmonologist Anurag Agarwal, however, the relation between air pollution and COVID-19 cases is very complex. While in general high air pollution increases risk of respiratory infections, it is difficult to say much more, he said. “Studies finding more infections and deaths in areas with high pollution have tried to statistically adjust for higher population density in polluted cities. Such adjusted correlations are interesting but do not represent proof,” Agarwal, director of the CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, told PTI. ""Nevertheless, it is clear that air pollution is bad for health and COVID-19 is more dangerous in unhealthy people. So the message is clear - we must take steps to reduce air pollution for many reasons,” he added.

Some areas like Mundka, Anand Vihar, Jahangirpuri, Vivek Vihar and Bawana recorded 'severe' levels of air pollution in the morning but by evening, Mundka and Vivek Vihar's AQI went into 'very poor' zone, they said. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), said the AQI is expected to remain in the same range for the next two days but without further deterioration. ""The surface winds are calm during the morning hours but it will pick up during day time, leading to better ventilation.

AQI is predicted to remain in 'very poor' range for the next two days but without further deterioration,"" it said. SAFAR also said stubble fire counts recorded a reduction and stood at 867 on Saturday. ""However, the boundary layer wind direction is north-westerly and wind speed is moderate. This will lead to an increase in pollutant transport towards the Delhi region and hence the SAFAR model estimate of stubble burning share in PM2.5 is 19 per cent today,"" it said. While the expected slight increase in local surface wind speed is a positive sign, the stubble transport level wind direction and speed is an unfavourable sign and likely to counter each other, it said.
 
SAFAR synergized stubble fire counts stood at 1,292 on Friday and its share in Delhi's pollution was nine per cent.
 
The AQI on Saturday was recorded 346, on Friday it was 366 while it was 302 on the previous day.

PM 2.5 are tiny particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter and can enter deep into the lungs and even the bloodstream. The figures are based on data collected from 36 monitoring stations in the city. The Delhi government has kick-started its 'Red Light On, Gaadi Off' anti-pollution campaign for which it has deployed 2,500 environment marshals at 100 traffic signals across the city to generate awareness and curb vehicular pollution. The drive will be implemented in all 70 assembly constituencies from October 26 and will go on till November 15 from 8 am to 8 pm.

It's not how you talk about friends and it's not how you solve global challenges like climate change,"" Biden said in a tweet, days after Trump during the final presidential debate accused China, India and Russia of not taking care of their ""filthy"" air. ""Kamala Harris and I deeply value our partnership and will put respect back at the centre of our foreign policy,"" Biden further said. During the final presidential debate with Biden in Nashville, Tennessee, Trump had on Thursday night said: ""Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India. It's filthy. The air is filthy."" Trump has repeatedly blamed countries like India and China for not doing enough on climate change, labelling them as regions with air that is impossible to breathe. In 2017, Trump had pulled the US out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, saying the international deal to keep global temperatures rises below 2 degree Celsius was disadvantageous to US workers. In his op-ed in the latest issue of ethnic India West weekly, Trump said that the ""Obama-Biden years were some of the best we've ever had between our two countries"". A Biden-Harris administration will build on that great progress and do even more. We can and should be natural allies, he wrote in the op-ed. “That’s why if elected President, I will continue what I have long called for: The US and India will stand together against terrorism in all its forms and work together to promote a region of peace and stability where neither China nor any other country threatens its neighbours,” he said. “We’ll open markets and grow the middle class in both the United States and India, and confront other international challenges together, like climate change, global health, transnational terrorism and nuclear proliferation,” said Biden.

According to the pollution monitoring agency, AQI in North Delhi's Alipur area was 447, which falls in the 'severe' category, followed by Shadipur, Wazirpur, Jahagirpuri, Mundka, Patparganj, Anand Vihar, Bawana, and Vivek Vihar. Besides these, 26 pollution monitoring station showed 'very poor' reading and one logged a moderate air quality index. The overall pollution levels continued to be in the lower end of the 'very poor' category at 372 at noon. Vijay Kumar Sonu, Head of Environment Monitoring and Research Centre at IMD told IANS that ""due to calm wind there is no dispersion of pollutants"". ""The wind speed will, however, pick up from October 26 and would likely result in improvement of AQI,"" he said. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, which comes under the aegis of Ministry of Earth Sciences, also stated that the most dominant factor for deterioration is the extremely calm surface wind in Delhi, combined with low inversion height followed by moderate stubble related intrusion. ""Highly calm surface wind conditions prevail over the Delhi region and is forecast to continue for the next two days. It will lead to low ventilation conditions and little dispersion for an extended period and hence accumulation of pollutants near the surface. Further deterioration of AQI is predicted for the next 2 days,"" the forecasting agency added. SAFAR also stated that there was significant stubble fire count around Haryana, Punjab, and neighbouring regions with the counts at 1,213 on Thursday, slightly less than what was a day before. ""However, the boundary layer wind direction is not fully favourable for pollutant transport towards Delhi region, the SAFAR model estimate of stubble burning share in PM2.5 is 17 per cent for today,"" it added. Neighbouring Gurugram, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Noida and Greater Noida -- also recorded 'very poor' quality of air. Greater Noida and Noida air are currently the most polluted among all.

According to the data shared by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee, Air Quality Index is at 387 in Anand Vihar, 333 in RK Puram, 391 in Rohini and 390 in Dwarka. All the four fall in the 'very poor' category, the data suggested. On Thursday, the Noida Authority said it has slapped penalties worth Rs 4.08 lakh on private contractors and other entities here that were found violating guidelines and rules to combat air pollution. Private contractors Chennai MSW and Waste Management Corporation, both engaged with waste collection, were slapped penalties worth Rs 1 lakh each for a rule violation, while two bulk waste generating entities have levied a fine of Rs 1.50 lakh for not installing waste processing units on their compounds, the Authority said. The continued action against polluters has come in the wake of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) coming into force amid deteriorating air quality in Delhi-NCR, even as the air quality in Noida remained in the ""very poor"" category on Thursday. ""Varying amount of penalties were imposed on other offenders, including those keeping construction material in open. Altogether, penalties worth Rs 4.08 lakh were imposed on Thursday over violation of guidelines of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the GRAP,"" it said in a statement. Road stretches measuring 110 kilometres were sprinkled with water, while another 243 kilometres on 67 routes were cleaned mechanically, it said. Footpaths and streets measuring 55 kilometres were cleaned during the night using water treated by sewage treatment plants, it stated. Meanwhile, as Delhi reels under another tryst with air pollution, several public health experts have flagged a spike in the number of patients reporting irritation in eyes because of toxic pollutants. The noxious air causes dry eye disease, which if left untreated, could lead to vision problems, they warn. The air pollution reaches a peak in Delhi and its surrounding regions every winter, when pollution from stubble burning and local sources combines with the suspended water droplets in the lower atmosphere to form a thick blanket of noxious smog, thus creating health hazards.

Speaking with news agency ANI, Dr Guleria stated that escalation of particulate pollution during the winter may not always be fatal but might have serious consequences. Many experts have sighted ample examples that identified that the number of all respiratory viruses shoot up during the winter months and have observed that SARS-CoV-2 is primarily a respiratory virus. ""Swine flu also shows a spike during winter months and it is likely that COVID-19 would also do the same. Coming to air pollution, there is data that shows air pollution may also lead to a higher prevalence of COVID-19. This is based on the study being done in the last few months in Italy and China,"" Dr Guleria said. The study in Italy found a positive correlation between PM 2.5 concentration and higher deaths due to COVID-19. ""If people are inhaling pollutants into the airways, that itself causes airways inflammation and leads to worsening of underlying respiratory conditions. In such a situation, if people get Covid infection, they may have a more severe infection which might lead to higher mortality because of this combination,"" he said. While explaining the correlation between rising cases, winter and air pollution, Dr Guleria said, ""This is particularly related to two things. Firstly, due to the fall in temperature, viruses can survive for longer periods of time in the environment, unlike summer. Secondly, due to winter people tend to stay indoors, in crowded and poorly-ventilated rooms (to conserve heat) which maximises person-to-person spread of the virus."" With the Air quality Index (AQI) oscillating between 'poor' to 'very poor' category, it has already come under notice that coronavirus cases have started spiking in Delhi. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in its latest bulletin (4 pm) on AQI, showed that with 296 and 215 index values in Delhi and Gurugram's, air quality rests in the poor category whereas in Faridabad, Ghaziabad, and Greater Noida it looms into very poor category.

However, the study found progress in reducing household air pollution exposures but levels stagnant for outdoor PM2.5. The report, State of Global Air 2020, said more than half of these deaths were associated with outdoor PM2.5 and others were linked to use of solid fuels such as charcoal, wood, and animal dung for cooking. Long-term exposure to outdoor and household air pollution contributed to over 1.67 million annual deaths from stroke, heart attack, diabetes, lung cancer, chronic lung diseases, and neonatal diseases in India in 2019. For the youngest infants, most deaths were related to complications from low birth weight and preterm birth. Overall, air pollution is now the largest risk factor for death among all health risks, according to the annual State of Global Air 2020 report published by the Health Effects Institute (HEI). The HEI is an independent, nonprofit research institute funded jointly by the US Environmental Protection Agency, industry, foundations, and development banks. The report highlights the ongoing challenge of high outdoor air pollution in South Asian countries. India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal feature among the top 10 countries with the highest PM2.5 exposures in 2019; all of these countries experienced increases in outdoor PM2.5 levels between 2010 and 2019. Use of solid fuels for cooking, however, presents a pattern of moderate success. Since 2010, more than 50 million fewer people have been exposed to household air pollution. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana Household LPG program and other schemes have helped to dramatically expand access to clean energy, especially for rural households. More recently, the National Clean Air Programme has spurred action on major air pollution sources in cities and states around the country. This report comes as Covid-19, a disease for which people with heart and lung disease are particularly at risk of infection and death, has claimed more than 110,000 lives in India. Although the full links between air pollution and Covid-19 are not yet known, there is clear evidence linking air pollution and increased heart and lung disease creating a growing concern that exposures to high levels of air pollution, during winter months in South Asian countries and East Asia, could exacerbate the effects of Covid-19. ""An infant's health is critical to the future of every society, and this newest evidence suggests an especially high risk for infants born in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa,"" said HEI President Dan Greenbaum. ""Although there has been slow and steady reduction in household reliance on poor-quality fuels, the air pollution from these fuels continues to be a key factor in the deaths of these youngest infants,"" he added. Infants in the first month of life are already at a vulnerable stage. But a growing body of scientific evidence from multiple countries, including recent ICMR-supported studies in India, indicates that particulate air pollution exposure during pregnancy is linked to low birth weight and pre-term birth. These latter conditions, both of which are associated with serious complications, already account for the vast majority of deaths in the neonatal period (4,55,000 in 2019).

However, the study found progress in reducing household air pollution exposures but levels stagnant for outdoor PM2.5. The report, State of Global Air 2020, said more than half of these deaths were associated with outdoor PM2.5 and others were linked to use of solid fuels such as charcoal, wood, and animal dung for cooking. Long-term exposure to outdoor and household air pollution contributed to over 1.67 million annual deaths from stroke, heart attack, diabetes, lung cancer, chronic lung diseases, and neonatal diseases in India in 2019. For the youngest infants, most deaths were related to complications from low birth weight and preterm birth. Overall, air pollution is now the largest risk factor for death among all health risks, according to the annual State of Global Air 2020 report published by the Health Effects Institute (HEI). The HEI is an independent, nonprofit research institute funded jointly by the US Environmental Protection Agency, industry, foundations, and development banks. The report highlights the ongoing challenge of high outdoor air pollution in South Asian countries. India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal feature among the top 10 countries with the highest PM2.5 exposures in 2019; all of these countries experienced increases in outdoor PM2.5 levels between 2010 and 2019. Use of solid fuels for cooking, however, presents a pattern of moderate success. Since 2010, more than 50 million fewer people have been exposed to household air pollution. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana Household LPG program and other schemes have helped to dramatically expand access to clean energy, especially for rural households. More recently, the National Clean Air Programme has spurred action on major air pollution sources in cities and states around the country. This report comes as Covid-19, a disease for which people with heart and lung disease are particularly at risk of infection and death, has claimed more than 110,000 lives in India. Although the full links between air pollution and Covid-19 are not yet known, there is clear evidence linking air pollution and increased heart and lung disease creating a growing concern that exposures to high levels of air pollution, during winter months in South Asian countries and East Asia, could exacerbate the effects of Covid-19. ""An infant's health is critical to the future of every society, and this newest evidence suggests an especially high risk for infants born in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa,"" said HEI President Dan Greenbaum. ""Although there has been slow and steady reduction in household reliance on poor-quality fuels, the air pollution from these fuels continues to be a key factor in the deaths of these youngest infants,"" he added. Infants in the first month of life are already at a vulnerable stage. But a growing body of scientific evidence from multiple countries, including recent ICMR-supported studies in India, indicates that particulate air pollution exposure during pregnancy is linked to low birth weight and pre-term birth. These latter conditions, both of which are associated with serious complications, already account for the vast majority of deaths in the neonatal period (4,55,000 in 2019). The new analysis reported in the State of Global Air this year estimates that nearly 21 per cent of neonatal deaths from all causes are attributable to ambient and household air pollution.

As winters are approaching, metro cities and other cities, towns, villages around them have started witnessing a rise in air pollution. Every year, the Delhi-NCR region faces a double-sided war with pollution arising due to diesel-petrol vehicles, industrial output and by stubble burning in the states neibhouring Delhi, including Haryana and Punjab. The national capital is already witnessing Air Quality Index (AQI) in 'poor' category. While air pollution is a serious matter as it may cause severe health issues when exposed repeatedly, take a look at some FAQs that have been answered for you. What is Air Pollution? Air Pollution is the presence of harmful, poisonous components, substances, tiny particles in the air that can harm the body. Most common issues that people face due to air pollution are breathing problems, running nose, etc. Repeated exposure to smog can lead to severe breathing issues. What are main causes of air pollution? The air pollution is caused due to the presence of these substances: Ammonia, Carbon Monoxide, Sulfur Dioxide, Nitrous Oxides, Methane and Chlorofluorocarbons, particulates (both organic and inorganic), and biological molecules in the air. These substances may arise from diesel-petrol vehicles, industrial output, construction work, stubble burning and other sources. What are the effects of air pollution? A living being exposed to air pollution can initially face problems such as breathing issues, headache, however, when exposed constantly and regularly, it may cause serious health issues such as chronic respiratory disease, lung cancer, heart disease, and even damage to the brain, nerves, liver, or kidneys. What are the 3 types of air pollution? Though there are several types of air pollution, the most common air pollution which people have to face are particle pollution, common air pollutants, greenhouse gases.

In a bid to tackle air pollution in Delhi-NCR, a complete ban on use of diesel generators has been imposed including in Noida, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Faridabad, Gurugram. However, the ban will not be imposed on essential and emergency services. Though the intent to ban diesel power generators is to curb pollution, the move has also led a lot of people to suffer who are residing in societies of Indirapuram and Ghaziabad. Residents who are facing problem following ban on gensets have to say that the move has led every classs of people to suffer. Society's RWA has said that people who are doing work from home are facing more trouble. Though essential services, including water pumps, lifts and common area lights have been allowed to operate using gensets, there are no systems installed through which generators can provide power supply only to run these services as generator supply is for the entire tower. Speaking on the matter, Federation of Noida & Greater Noida Apartment Owners Association (FONAA) President, Sahdeep Singh Chauhan, said ""... diesel generator sets in residential high rise societies in Noida and Greater Noida are used only in case there is a breakdown in grid power, so is not a notieable contributor in pollution. Please allow the use of DG sets in residential high rise buildings of Noida and Greater Noida in the larger interest of public during Covid19 pandemic times."" ""How is my child going to study in peace knowing that there could be a power cut at any moment? How am I going to work without WiFi internet?"" Vikas Singh, a resident of ATS Advantage, a high-rise in Ghaziabad, worriedly asked. The Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority ordered a ban on diesel generators, except for emergency purposes, in Delhi and neighbouring cities from Thursday (October 15) as part of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to control air pollution. However, the order has come as torture for the residents, especially those living in more than 1,000 residential condominiums situated across Delhi-NCR. These condominiums have installed back-up power systems, and almost all run on diesel generators. The residents are questioning the applicability of the move when half the economy is running via Work From Home (WFH), and the education has gone entirely digital. Many high-rises have put out a circular this morning informing their residents about EPCA's order and shut down of the back-up power systems enforced by it. The residents complained that the duration of power cuts in Noida and Ghaziabad could go as long as six hours in a day.

With winters approaching and easing of the coronavirus-induced lockdown, Delhi-NCR is bracing for months of poor air quality. The national capital's air quality was in the 'poor' category on Sunday morning. According to doctors, respiratory illnesses like viral influenza increase with a spike in pollution levels as poor air quality leads to inflammation in the lungs making it more vulnerable for the virus to penetrate. ""This year, we have COVID-19. Like the common cold, the transmission of this virus is expected to increase with a rise in pollution levels. We may see a further surge in cases. ""It would be a taxing time for testing centres as they have to cater to people with coronavirus and also non-COVID patients with similar symptoms,"" Dr Neeraj Nischal, an associate professor in the Department of Medicine at AIIMS, told PTI. Experts feel the worst-affected would be people in the lower socioeconomic class with no access to masks and also vulnerable to additional risk factors such as chulla smoke. ""Transmission apart, the presentation of COVID-19 like other viral respiratory illnesses will be more severe in high-pollution areas. This will burden hospitals as more patients become symptomatic, requiring admission,"" Dr Nischal said. According to Dr Neeraj Gupta, a professor in the Department of Pulmonary, Critical care and Sleep medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, mortality has been linked with population density, the proximity of people and heavily industrialized or urbanised areas which have higher pollution levels. These factors are likely to become more effective during the festive season and winters, particularly in north India where stubble burning is common and this affects air quality severely, he said. ""Italy showed a possible link between PM 2.5 concentration and excess mortality to the extent that one unit increase is associated with a 9 per cent increase in COVID-19 mortality,"" Dr Gupta said, adding pollution can also assist in the transmission of the novel coronavirus. During smog, particulate matters remain suspended in the air near the earth's surface for a longer period making it conducive for the transmission of the virus, he elaborated. Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant of Internal Medicine at Apollo Hospitals, said, ""We really don't know how this virus is going to behave. But, we need to prepare ourselves for the worst, as pollution level increases and with winter setting in. It will be a dangerous combination."" He cautioned that people with respiratory illness, like asthma and bronchitis, were at much higher risk of contracting coronavirus infection. ""For people who have tested positive for COVID-19, it is going to be a double whammy, with pollution making things worse,"" he told PTI. Doctors warn that even those who have had COVID-19 in the past are not out of the woods. ""Post-COVID fibrosis and immunoparalysis make their lungs more susceptible to super-added bacterial pneumonia and other viral respiratory illnesses. We urge everyone to get inoculated with the influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine to prevent additional infections in these times,"" Dr Nischal stressed. According to Dr Gupta, with the cohort of survivors of COVID-19 increasing, a significant number is noted to be symptomatic -- 43 per cent with respiratory complaints-- even after two months. These individuals are particularly vulnerable to air pollution, which is known to cause chronic airway irritation and inflammation, affects mucus clearing, impairs immunity and acutely precipitates airway disorders like asthma, COPD, lung fibrosis or even cancer-related conditions. Dr Vivek Nangia, principal director and head of pulmonology, Max Super Speciality Hospital in Delhi's Saket said that for individuals belonging to the high-risk groups who are at extremes of ages and suffering from chronic disease are advised to stay indoors or at least restrict their movement to bare essential activities outdoors. ""While outdoors, wear a mask at all times and stay away from firecrackers during Diwali. Keep inhaler handy and consult a doctor at the earliest. Even for the others, it is strongly recommended that they minimize their outdoor activities and wear a mask at all time,"" he said. ""The number of cases will go up. There is a study which has been published by Harvard Medical School, USA, where they have shown that with every 1 micron per metre rise in PM 2.5 particles, there's an 8 per cent increase in the mortality,"" he said. Dr Gupta said, ""Indeed, a tough time for post-COVID patients is in store.

A bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice AK Goel noted that brick kiln industry contributed about 5 to 7 per cent of PM10 emissions in winter and summer, respectively, to ambient air of Delhi and NCR. ""The concerned authorities in the state of Uttar Pradesh may keep a vigil against illegal operation of brick kilns so as to protect the air quality in the NCR,"" the bench, also comprising Justice SP Wangdi, said. It also dismissed an application seeking permission to operate brick kiln. The NGT had earlier slammed the Uttar Pradesh chief secretary for allowing brick kilns to operate in the state despite its prohibition during the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. The NGT said it was surprised how the chief secretary could have passed a contrary order in violation of the order of this tribunal which amounts to a criminal offence. The order came after the Ghaziabad district magistrate told the bench that in March, due to the lockdown situation in the district with respect to COVID-19, inspections at kilns could not be carried out. He told the tribunal that during the lockdown period, the chief secretary issued directions to all the district magistrates of Uttar Pradesh to allow the brick kilns to operate in the state. The NGT had earlier directed the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to conduct a carrying capacity study of brick kilns in NCR and other regions and its impact on ambient air quality. The tribunal was hearing a bunch of pleas filed by journalist Shailesh Singh and others seeking action against brick kilns, which are operating without complying to pollution norms and causing immense air and water pollution. It alleged that 600 brick kilns are illegally operating in Baghpat district without obtaining necessary clearances from statutory authorities concerned. The plea, filed through advocate Preeti Singh, listed seven districts of Uttar Pradesh, including Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar, Baghpat, Meerut, Hapur and Muzaffarnagar, 13 districts of Haryana, including Gurgaon, and two districts (Alwar and Bharatpur) of Rajasthan, besides Delhi in the petition.

The research, published in the journal Nature Communications, found that during the first six months of this year, 8.8 per cent less CO2 was emitted than in the same period in 2019 -- a total decrease of 1,551 million tonnes. The research not only offers a much more precise look at COVID-19's impact on global energy consumption than previous analyses, but also suggests what fundamental steps could be taken to stabilise the global climate in the aftermath of the pandemic. ""What makes our study unique is the analysis of meticulously collected near-real-time data,"" said Zhu Liu from the Tsinghua University in China. ""By looking at the daily figures compiled by the Carbon Monitor research initiative we were able to get a much faster and more accurate overview, including timelines that show how emissions decreases have corresponded to lockdown measures in each country,” said Liu. The researchers noted that in April, at the height of the first wave of coronavirus infections, when most major countries shut down their public life and parts of their economy, emissions even declined by 16.9 per cent. The lockdown measures during various outbreaks resulted in emission drops that are normally seen only on a short-term basis on holidays such as Christmas or the Chinese Spring Festival, they said. The study also shows which parts of the global economy were most impacted. ""The greatest reduction of emissions was observed in the ground transportation sector,"" explained Daniel Kammen, professor at the University of California, Berkeley in the US. ""Largely because of working from home restrictions, transport CO2 emissions decreased by 40 per cent worldwide. In contrast, the power and industry sectors contributed less to the decline, with minus 22 per cent and minus 17 per cent, respectively, as did the aviation and shipping sectors,"" Kammen said. Even the residential sector saw a small emissions drop of 3 per cent, largely because of an abnormally warm winter in the northern hemisphere, heating energy consumption decreased with most people staying at home all day during lockdown periods, the researchers said. The team based its estimates on a wide array of data: precise, hourly datasets of electricity power production in 31 countries, daily vehicle traffic in more than 400 cities worldwide, and daily global passenger flights. The researchers also used monthly production data for industry in 62 countries as well as fuel consumption data for building emissions in more than 200 countries. They also found strong rebound effects. With the exception of a continuing decrease of emissions stemming from the transportation sector, by July 2020, as soon as lockdown measures were lifted, most economies resumed their usual levels of emitting CO2. However, the researchers noted that even if they remained at their historically low levels, this would have a rather minuscule effect on the long-term CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. They stress that the only valid strategy to stabilise the climate is a complete overhaul of the industry and commerce sector. ""While the CO2 drop is unprecedented, decreases of human activities cannot be the answer,"" said Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, founding director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. ""Instead we need structural and transformational changes in our energy production and consumption systems. Individual behaviour is certainly important, but what we really need to focus on is reducing the carbon intensity of our global economy,"" Schellnhuber added.

A study, published in the Journal of Clinical, discovered that air pollution was a risk factor that contributed to the common soil of other fatal problems like heart attack and stroke. ""In this study, we created an environment that mimicked a polluted day in New Delhi or Beijing,"" Rajagopalan said. ""We concentrated fine particles of air pollution called PM2.5. Concentrated particles like this develop from human impact on the environment, such as automobile exhaust, power generation and other fossil fuels,"" he added. These particles have been strongly connected to risk factors for disease. For example, the cardiovascular effects of air pollution can lead to heart attack and stroke. The research team has shown exposure to air pollution can increase the likelihood of the same risk factors that lead to heart diseases, such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In the mouse model study, three groups were observed: a control group receiving clean filtered air, a group exposed to polluted air for 24 weeks, and a group fed a high-fat diet. Interestingly, the researchers found that being exposed to air pollution was comparable to eating a high-fat diet. Both the air pollution and high-fat diet groups showed insulin resistance and abnormal metabolism - just like one would see in a pre-diabetic state. These changes were associated with changes in the epigenome, a layer of control that can masterfully turn on and turn off thousands of genes, representing a critical buffer in response to environmental factors. This study is the first-of-its-kind to compare genome-wide epigenetic changes in response to air pollution, compare and contrast these changes with that of eating an unhealthy diet, and examine the impact of air pollution cessation on these changes. ""The good news is that these effects were reversible, at least in our experiments. Once the air pollution was removed from the environment, the mice appeared healthier and the pre-diabetic state seemed to reverse,"" the author wrote.

The World Health Organisation guideline stipulates that PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter) not exceed 10 micron per cubic metre and that PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter) not exceed 20 micron per cubic metre. In India, average PM2.5 concentration in 2018 was 63 micron per cubic metre. A new analysis of the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC) found that across India's total population, life expectancy would increase by 5.2 years if pollution is reduced in accordance with WHO guidelines. ""The particulate pollution has sharply increased over time. Since 1998, average annual particulate pollution has increased 42 per cent, cutting 1.8 years off the life of the average resident over those years,"" the report noted. A quarter of India's population is exposed to pollution levels not seen in any other country, with 248 million residents of northern India on track to lose more than 8 years of life expectancy if pollution levels persist, the report based on the analysis said. Lucknow was seen to have the highest level of pollution in the country, with pollution 11 times greater than the WHO guideline. ""Residents of Lucknow stand to lose 10.3 years of life expectancy if pollution persists,"" the report said. It further said the residents of Delhi could see 9.4 years added to their lives if pollution were reduced to meet the WHO guideline and 6.5 years if pollution met India's national standard. The findings indicate that citizens in states like Bihar and West Bengal can add more than 7 years to their life if air quality met the WHO guideline and residents in Haryana can expect to live 8 years longer if the WHO guideline was achieved. Saying that all of India's 1.4 billion people live in areas where the annual average particulate pollution level exceeds the WHO guideline, the report said 84 per cent live in areas where it exceeds India's own air quality standard. Four countries that account for nearly a quarter of the world's population -- Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan -- are also among the most polluted, with northern India emerging as the most polluted part of South Asia, the report noted. Over the course of the last 20 years, industrialization, economic development, and population growth have led to skyrocketing energy demand in these countries, it said, adding in India and Pakistan, the number of vehicles on the road has increased about four-fold since the early 2000s. ""In Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan combined, electricity generation from fossil fuels tripled from 1998 to 2017. Crop burning, brick kilns, and other industrial activity also contributed to rising particulate pollution in the region,"" the report said.

(Representational image) Only nine among 102 approved city-specific clean air plans have a budget outline for the execution of proposed air pollution mitigation activities, while the rest of them, including Delhi, lack it, a new study has found. ""About 90 per cent of India's approved city-specific clean air plans do not have a budget outline,"" said the study, conducted by think tanks Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) and Urban Emissions. ""....and 75 per cent of them do not contain crucial information on emission from different polluting sources, leading to replication of action points and timelines across many highly-polluted cities,"" it said. It said, the cities with a budget outline for pollution-mitigation activities are: Amravati, Badlapur, Mumbai, Nashik, Pune and Solapur (all in Maharashtra), Dimapur and Kohima (in Nagaland), and Patencheru in Telangana. The study also found that apart from Delhi's clean air plan, other city-specific clean air plans also do not have a legal mandate for implementation. ""As India gradually emerges from a lockdown, air pollution in its cities is again on the rise,"" said the study titled ""How Robust are Urban India's Clean Air Plans?: An Assessment of 102 cities"". The study reveals that multiplicity of agencies is another problem that plagues these plans. ""It was found that pollution control boards are in charge of only 24 per cent of the mitigation activities listed in the plans, while 37 per cent come under the ambit of municipal corporations and urban local bodies (ULBs),"" it said. ""Over 40 per cent of the action points listed fall under the purview of multiple agencies. Besides, none of the plans proposes a regional coordination mechanism, although about 30 per cent of the pollution is from sources outside the city boundaries,"" it said. Tanushree Ganguly, a researcher at CEEW and a co-author of the study, said, the clampdown on all nonessential activities because of the pandemic and the resultant decline in pollution levels have made the environmental footprint of economic activity in the cities extremely evident. ""In order to ensure that blue skies become permanent, cities should be absolutely certain of their short, medium, and long-term air pollution reduction goals,"" she said. State and municipal budgets also need to reflect planned expenditure on air pollution mitigation, Ganguly added. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched in January 2019, has listed the preparation and implementation of city-specific air quality management plans as a primary mitigation measure for reducing PM 2.5 concentration by 20 to 30 per cent by 2024. ""Execution of mitigation measures calls for cross-departmental coordination. For instance, action plans of 15 non-attainment cities in Uttar Pradesh list 56 measures across 17 different agencies,"" said Kurinji Selvaraj, a researcher at CEEW and a co-author of the study. ""Of these, about 30 per cent of actions fall under multiple agencies and this could fragment the accountability. Hence, for each action point, it is crucial to delineate specific tasks among participating agencies."" In the Union Budget for 2020-21, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had allocated Rs 4,400 crore ""to encourage such states that are formulating and implementing plans for ensuring cleaner air in cities (with population) above one million"". However, only nine cities have listed budgetary requirements for executing the action points listed. Overall, the study states that the plans stand as a collection of measures without specified goals and priorities. Besides, the lack of a national emission inventory and the absence of a standard protocol for air pollution emission reporting across states hinder the setting of emission reduction targets, it said. The CEEW-Urban Emissions study reviewed existing global literature on clean air planning to identify key components of a clean air plan, including the presence of a legal framework, source information, responsibility delineation, and the cost-effectiveness of proposed solutions. ""The 102 approved clean air plans for Indian non-attainment cities were then examined for the presence or absence of these elements,"" it said. The CEEW is a South Asia-based not-for-profit policy research institution.

According to the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), PM 2.5 levels across Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru dropped by a phenomenal 45-88 per cent during the pandemic-induced lockdown period. The analysis, however, found that the ""pollution registered a comeback"" as the nation opened up pursuant to lockdown 4.0. ""In the six cities, there was a two-six times increase in PM 2.5 levels during lockdown 4.0,"" said the report. According to the findings, the national capital saw the steepest rise of four to eight times, as compared to two to six times in other cities. The initial decrease in pollution could be attributed to no industrial activity, reduced on-road traffic and temporary halt on construction activities. Sunita Narain, Director General of Centre for Science and Environment said that the analysis showed the nation needed an intervention at such a massive scale to make skies blue and our air and lungs clean. ""It tells us that there should be no question, therefore, on the key sources of air pollution in our country: emissions from vehicles and industry,"" she added. CSE also presented a charter of environmental demands to ensure a better, cleaner and more sustainable environment, life and air quality. It stated that reducing pollution from heavy-duty vehicles, switching to clean vehicles, using clean power and providing green economic stimulus were a few strategies which could help retain the healthy air. Centre's executive director Anumita Roychowdhury said the nation must ensure that pollution levels do not go back to 'normal' - what they were before the lockdown.

According to the study, published in the journal JAMA Neurology, patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) who live in polluted environments may require additional support from care providers to prevent dementia. ""Interestingly, we were able to establish harmful effects on human health at levels below current air pollution standards,"" said study first author Giulia Grande from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden. ""The findings suggest air pollution does play a role in the development of dementia, and mainly through the intermediate step of cardiovascular disease and especially stroke,"" Grande added. According to the study, the number of people living with dementia is projected to triple in the next 30 years globally. No curative treatment has been identified and the search for modifiable risk and protective factors remains a public health priority. Recent studies have linked both cardiovascular disease and air pollution to the development of dementia, but findings on the air pollution-link have been scarce and inconsistent. To reach the conclusion, the researchers examined the link between long-term exposure to air pollution and dementia and what role cardiovascular diseases play in that association. Almost 3,000 adults with an average age of 74 and living in the Kungsholmen district in central Stockholm were followed for up to 11 years. Of those, 364 people developed dementia. The annual average level of particulate matter 2.5 microns or less in width (PM2.5) are considered low compared to international standards. For the last five years of exposure, the risk of dementia increased by more than 50 per cent per interquartile range (IQR) difference in mean PM2.5 levels and by 14 per cent per IQR in nitrogen oxide, the researchers said. Earlier exposures seemed less important. Heart failure and ischemic heart disease both enhanced the dementia risk and stroke explained almost 50 per cent of air pollution-related dementia cases. Air pollution is an established risk factor for cardiovascular health and because CVD accelerates cognitive decline. ""We believe exposure to air pollution might negatively affect cognition indirectly,"" said Grande. ""In the study, virtually all of the association of air pollution with dementia seemed to be through the presence or the development of CVD, adding more reason to reduce emissions and optimize treatment of concurrent CVD and related risk factors, particularly for people living in the most polluted areas of our cities,"" she added.

A bench of justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta said this while hearing a plea filed by the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), seeking permission to allow registration of several diesel vehicles of 2000cc capacity and above to carry out solid waste management. ""We are worried for future. It is not for today,"" the bench said, referring to the menace of pollution in the Delhi-National Capital Region. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for EDMC, told the bench that vehicles required by the civic body for solid waste management were available in diesel variant as the power needed for these vehicles can be generated only by diesel fuel. ""Next in future, you will have to buy BS-VI compliant vehicles. Once BS-VI will come into play, the pollution from diesel vehicles will reduce,"" the bench said. Mehta said these vehicles were required for essential services only. The bench was informed that other agencies, including civic bodies, also needed new diesel vehicles to carry out their works. The bench sought a chart of the number of vehicles needed along with its particulars and posted the matter for hearing on March 16. During the hearing, the bench asked, ""Instead of going for BS-VI variant, why do you want to go for BS-IV variant vehicles?"" One of the counsel appearing in the matter said the vehicles needed by the civic bodies are so far available in BS-IV variant only. The bench also dealt with the issue of installation of smog towers, being designed as large-scale air purifiers to reduce air pollution, in the national capital. In January this year, the court had given three months to the Centre and the Delhi government for the pilot project of setting up smog towers at Connaught Place and Anand Vihar here. During the hearing on Friday, Additional Solicitor General A N S Nadkarni told the bench that the apex court had given three months' time for setting up smog towers but the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), which is assisting authorities in the project, has said it required around 10 months. The counsel appearing for the Delhi government also said they require time till August-September this year to set up smog towers. The bench has posted the matter for hearing on March 27. These issues have cropped up before the top court which is hearing a matter related to air-pollution in the Delhi-NCR.

The pollution monitoring satellites of the space agencies detected significant decreases over China in nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a noxious gas emitted by motor vehicles, power plants, and industrial facilities, NASA said in a statement. In January, Chinese authorities had shut down transportation going into and out of Wuhan, as well as local businesses, in order to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus (COVID-19). It was the first of several quarantines set up in the country and around the world, according to NASA. The virus has so far killed over 3,000 people, and infected more than 88,000 globally after the outbreak in China in December last year. Maps created using data from NASA and ESA satellites show NO2 values across China from January 1-20 (before the quarantine) and February 10-25 (during the quarantine). NASA images show drop in China's air pollution after coronavirus lockdown The data were collected by the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on ESA's Sentinel-5 satellite. A related sensor, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA's Aura satellite, has been making similar measurements. According to NASA scientists, the reduction in NO2 pollution was first apparent near Wuhan, but eventually spread across the country. ""This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a wide area for a specific event,"" said Fei Liu, an air quality researcher at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Liu recalls seeing a drop in NO2 over several countries during the economic recession that began in 2008, but the decrease was gradual.
Scientists also observed a significant reduction around Beijing during the 2008 Olympics, but the effect was mostly localised around that city, and pollution levels rose again once the Olympics ended. The drop in nitrogen dioxide in 2020 also coincided with Lunar New Year celebrations in China, and much of Asia, according to NASA.
Generally, businesses and factories close from the last week in January into early February to celebrate the festival. Past observations have shown that air pollution usually decreases during this period and then increases once the celebration is over, NASA said. ""There is always this general slowdown around this time of the year,"" said Barry Lefer, an air quality scientist at NASA. ""Our long-term OMI data allows us to see if these amounts are abnormal and why,""Lefer said. Launched in 2004, OMI has been collecting global data on NO2 and various air pollutants for more than 15 years. The maps show NO2 values over three periods in 2020: January 1-20 (before Lunar New Year), January 28-February 9 (around New Year celebrations), and February 10-25 (after the event). The 2020 values were compared to the same periods in 2019 for reference. Lefer noted that the overall values in 2020 were lower than 2019 due to new environmental regulations that China has enforced over the past few years. While the Lunar New Year may have played a role in the recent dropoff, researchers believe the decrease is more than a holiday effect or weather-related variation. In a preliminary analysis, NASA researchers compared NO2 values detected by OMI in 2020 with the average amounts detected at this time of year from 2005-2019. In 2020, NO2 values in eastern and central China were significantly lower -- from 10 to 30 per cent lower -- than what is normally observed for this time period. Liu and colleagues have not seen a rebound in NO2 after the holiday. ""This year, the reduction rate is more significant than in past years and it has lasted longer,"" she said. ""I am not surprised because many cities nationwide have taken measures to minimise spread of the virus,"" Liu added.

The findings may be especially important for parts of the world with higher air pollution where fine particulate matter levels are five to 10 times higher than in the US, the study said. It's known that breathing in air pollution can have detrimental health effects beyond the lungs, but few studies have shown how it impacts the kidneys, which act as filters for the blood. ""As rates of chronic kidney disease rise worldwide, it is important to understand whether and how exposure to air pollution plays a role,"" said study researcher Matthew F. Blum from the Johns Hopkins University in the US. For the findings, published in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, the research team examined information on 10,997 adults across four sites in the US who were followed from 1996-1998 through 2016. The researchers estimated the monthly average levels of tiny particles of air pollution--called fine particulate matter--based on participants' home addresses. Fine particulate matter comes from a variety of sources including fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, and natural sources, they said. The team found that exposure to higher amounts of fine particulate matter was associated with a higher degree of albuminuria -- a marker of kidney dysfunction -- at the start of the study as well as a higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease over time. According to the researchers, future studies should examine whether efforts to improve air quality yield health benefits, including reducing rates of chronic kidney disease.

Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. ""The study shows that the higher the level of air pollution, the higher the risk of schizophrenia. For each 10 µg/m3 (concentration of air pollution per cubic metre) increase in the daily average, the risk of schizophrenia increases by approximately 20 per cent,"" said study researcher Henriette Thisted Horsdal from Aarhus University in Denmark. ""Children who are exposed to an average daily level above 25 µg/m3 have an approx. 60 per cent greater risk of developing schizophrenia compared to those who are exposed to less than 10 µg/m3,"" Horsdal added. According to the study, published in the journal JAMA Network Open, the research team included 23,355 people in total, and of these, 3,531 developed schizophrenia. ""The risk of developing schizophrenia is also higher if you have a higher genetic liability for the disease. Our data shows that these associations are independent of each other,"" Horsdal said. The association between air pollution and schizophrenia cannot be explained by a higher genetic liability in people who grow up in areas with high levels of air pollution, the researcher said. According to the study, the researchers combine genetic data from iPSYCH with air pollution data from the Department of Environmental Science for the results. Though the results demonstrate an increased risk of schizophrenia when the level of air pollution during childhood increases, the researchers cannot comment on the cause. Instead they emphasise that further studies are needed before they can identify the cause of this association, they concluded.

The study, published in The Journal of Physiology, by researchers at The University of Manchester in UK, shows that the knowledge people have about how pollution harms the hearts of marine species can be applied to humans, as the underlying mechanisms are similar. Around 11,000 coronary heart disease and stroke deaths in the UK each year are attributable to air pollution, specifically due to particulate matter (PM), or small particles in the air that cause health problems. PM2.5 is one of the finest and most dangerous type of PM, is a compound for which the UK has failed to meet European Union limits. ""We know that air pollution can have a hugely damaging effect on heart and circulatory health, and this review summarises mechanisms potentially contributing to impaired heart function,"" said study researcher Jeremy Pearson, Associate Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation. For the findings, the researchers looked across all vertebrates and particularly focused on a set of compounds that binds to the surface of PM, called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as its amount on PM is associated with the detrimental affects that air pollution has on the heart. ""Pollution affects all of us living on Planet Earth.

Air purifier makers like Philips, Blueair, Panasonic, Eureka, Forbes, Sharp, Xiomi and Blue Star reported high double-digit jump in sales. Besides Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR), the companies also saw higher demand from tier-II cities like Lucknow and Kanpur. The norther region contributes more than half of the sales of air purifiers. While Delhi-NCR continued to top sales chart for air purifiers, this year also saw some of the companies reporting higher number of sales from markets like Kerala and North East. ""This year, the air purifier market in India stood at Rs 450 crore and we have witnessed a strong surge in air purifier penetration, recording a 60 per cent growth over last year till date,"" Philips Personal Health, Indian Subcontinent Vice-President Gulbahar Taurani said. Sharp sold around 15,000 units in the month of October and November this year. ""Sharp witnessed 27 per cent growth in sales in these two months,"" Sharp Business Systems India President Consumer Electronics Kishlay Ray said. ""This year, we have witnessed sales of our air purifier in strange markets where we never thought pollution is an issue. For example, Kerala and North East (which accounted for nearly 3 per cent of our total sales), apart from well-known pollution hotspots like Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata and so on,"" he added. Similarly, Eureka Forbes also reported a 30 per cent growth, its Chief Transformation Officer Shashank Sinha said. ""The air purifier market was dominated by one market predominantly that is Delhi-NCR, followed by certain non-metros which did fairly well during the peak season,"" Sinha added. While the market for room air purifiers is in a nascent stage, limited to some key metro cities a few years ago, it has now started expanding to smaller cities. FMCG major Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), which operates in air purifier category with its brands Blueair and Pureit, also saw a double- digit growth. ""We have seen a healthy double-digit growth during the peak season this year. More than 70 per cent of our sales still come from the north region,"" a HUL spokesperson said. ""While the category is nascent in smaller towns, we have seen signs of demand picking up in tier II towns in north India,"" he added.
With the rise in air pollution, the companies believe that air purifiers are gradually becoming a lifestyle product and are likely to see sales throughout the year by shedding the tag of being a seasonal product. According to Xiaomi India Head - Categories and Online Sales Raghu Reddy, ""The response to air purifiers has been overwhelming and positive throughout the year owing to the fact that today it has become a necessity for Indian consumers."" ""We have noticed a trend of awareness and acceptance of the poor air quality and environmental issues than before. Today, people are pro-actively taking precautions and improving the quality of indoor air that they are breathing."" Panasonic India General Manager, Air Purifier Business Syed Moonis Ali Alvi said, ""With the rise in pollution levels, backed by the increasing awareness and growing preferences for health and wellness products, air purifiers have become a part of our lifestyle today."" According to market experts, the segment is growing at around 15 to 20 per cent annually and more than 15 companies are operating in the space. However, Blue Star, which witnessed 25 per cent growth in the segment, cautioned about the quality of products being sold in the market and demanded that its standards should be defined and regulated. ""Air purifiers are sold from Rs 800 to Rs 57,000 in the market. Someone has even put charcoal and is selling it as room air purifier,"" Blue Star Managing Director B Thiagarajan said. ""This should be treated as health care product and should be regulated. There should be some certification,"" he added. According to him, some of the makers are simply importing products without understanding the market. ""In this chaos which is going on, suddenly one week or 10 days after stubble burning, people are buying it,"" he said, adding that it is very important to assure the people that the air is being purified. According to Assocham-TechSci Research report published in February 2019, air purifiers are among the fastest growing products in home appliances space.

High levels of air pollution are violation of the right to breathe clean air. The entire north India has turned into a gas chamber, they said. ""We request the prime minister and all state governments to declare a national health emergency, enforce existing laws on trash and biomass burning strictly and focus on controlling emissions arising from all sources urgently,"" 'The Clean Air Collective' said. Environmental advocacy organisations, including 'Care for Air', 'My Right To Breathe' and 'Chintan', among others, hoped that ""we don't have a situation where world powers need to intervene in our ability to manage this national health emergency"". Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency, said light winds had been blowing over the Indo-Gangetic plains for the past few days. ""Dust, vehicular and industrial emissions remain suspended near the ground in the absence of favourable wind speed,"" he said.

The apex court though made an exception when it came to construction activity for the India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO) at the Pragati Maidan, where the Trade Fair draws huge crowds. Earlier this week during the hearing on air pollution matter, the apex court termed Delhi ""worse than hell"" in the backdrop of pollution (air, water and garbage) in the city. At the end of the hearing, the Centre requested a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra to allow limited construction activity at the ITPO, to make the area ready for exhibition. The Centre assured that no pollution shall be permitted to be caused by the activity, following which the top court permitted the one-of request with certain riders. This direction is in sharp contrast to the principled position taken by the apex court, where it ordered zero-tolerance to any activity contributing to air pollution. The Centre told the apex court: ""There is only some work of seven days left to enable holding of these events, such as housekeeping and cleaning the halls, preparation of access ways from Bhairon Road, strengthening and compacting at Hall No. 5, compaction of approach road for movement of cargo trucks and fire tenders from Gate No. 5 to Hall A3-A5, laying of temporary electrical services and water supply lines etc."" The court during the hearing had earlier noted: ""The reports and the scientific data indicating that large section of people are suffering from the dreaded diseases due to such air pollution such as Cancer, Asthma and various other diseases. Life span is adversely affected."" The court emphasized the states have redrawn its focus to recognise right to life is important right. ""Human life and health have been put in danger. In such scenario, why they should not be required to pay compensation to such persons who are being affected by inadequate arrangement to check the air pollution, non-lifting of garbage, waste which add ultimately to the pollution"", said the court. However, now it has allowed the construction activity at ITPO. The apex court has also asked the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to submit a report regarding lifting the restriction of the other construction activity. ""Let the report be submitted by the CPCB. Then we will take a call whether we have to relax the restrictions that have been imposed. List after 10 days,"" said the court. The absence of any construction activity in Delhi, many daily-wagers have been left in lurch, and potentially having to scamper for funds during the peak winter season.

458,IndiaTV News,https://www.indiatvnews.com/science/alcohol-molecules-answer-to-air-pollutants-haze-decoded-566896,Alcohol molecules can be the answer to growing pollution and haze in atmosphere: Study,"Published : Nov 27, 2019 13:08 IST, Updated : Nov 27, 2019 13:08 IST","Researchers have decoded how air pollutants form and grow in the haze. The study also showed how alcohol molecules help bring down air pollutants. Alcohol molecules, abundant in the atmosphere, can reduce the formation of hazardous polluting particles that make up haze, according to a study which may lead to more accurate models for air pollution, weather, and climate. The researchers, including those from the University of Pennsylvania in the US, studied how methanol consumed one of the ingredients of haze -- sulphur trioxide -- and reduced the formation of toxic pollutant particles PM2.5 and PM10 -- which are nearly 10 to 30 times smaller than the width of a single human hair. According to a study published in The Lancet journal, exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5) caused about 525,000 premature deaths in India in 2015. The results of the current study, published in the journal PNAS, revealed that in dry and polluted conditions with abundant alcohol and sulphur trioxide in the atmosphere, and less availability of water, a chemical reaction drove down the formation of the toxic particles. ""Right now, we're all concerned about PM2.5 and PM10 because these have some real air-quality and health consequences,"" said study co-author Joseph S. Francisco from the University of Pennsylvania. The researchers said sulphur trioxide combined with water molecules in the atmosphere to form sulphuric acid -- a major component of acid rain, and one of the most important ""seeds"" for particles to grow and form networked structures in the atmosphere. ""The question has been, How do you suppress the formation of these kinds of particles? This work actually gives some very important insight, for the first time, into how you can suppress particle growth,"" Francisco said. The researchers used powerful computer models and simulations of the molecules and found that the sulphur trioxide in the air could react with alcohols such as methanol when it is abundant in the atmosphere. The product of this reaction, they said, was methyl hydrogen sulphate (MHS), which they added is sticky enough to seed the particle-formation process. ""Because this reaction converts alcohols to more sticky compounds. Initially, we thought it would promote the particle formation process. But it doesn't. That's the most interesting part. Alcohols consume or compete for sulphur trioxide so less of it is available to form sulphuric acid,"" said study co-author Jie Zhong, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. While the reaction may play a significant role in driving down the rate of PM2.5 and PM10 formation, the study cautioned that MHS formed in the reaction has also been linked to negative health impacts. ""It's a balance. On the one hand this reaction reduces new particle formation, but on the other hand it produces another product that is not very healthy,"" Zhong said. According to the researchers, models currently in use to simulate particle formation are not very accurate, and incorporating the newly discovered mechanism may make them better.

460,IndiaTV News,https://www.indiatvnews.com/science/air-pollution-linked-to-higher-risk-of-blindness-study-566657,Air pollution linked to higher risk of blindness: Study,"Published : Nov 26, 2019 13:44 IST, Updated : Nov 26, 2019 13:44 IST","Air pollution linked to higher risk of blindness: Study Exposure to polluted air is associated with an increased risk of glaucoma, a debilitating eye condition that can cause blindness, according to a study. The findings, published in the journal Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science, show that people in neighbourhoods with higher amounts of fine particulate matter pollution were at least six per cent more likely to report having glaucoma than those in the least-polluted areas. ""We have found yet another reason why air pollution should be addressed as a public health priority, and that avoiding sources of air pollution could be worthwhile for eye health alongside other health concerns,"" said lead author Paul Foster, a professor at the University College London (UCL) in the UK. ""While we cannot confirm yet that the association is causal, we hope to continue our research to determine whether air pollution does indeed cause glaucoma, and to find out if there are any avoidance strategies that could help people reduce their exposure to air pollution to mitigate the health risks,"" Foster said in a statement. Glaucoma, a neurodegenerative disease, is the leading global cause of irreversible blindness and affects over 60 million people worldwide, the researchers noted. It most commonly results from a build-up of pressure from fluid in the eye, causing damage to the optic nerve that connects the eye to the brain, they said. ""Most risk factors for glaucoma are out of our control, such as older age or genetics. It's promising that we may have now identified a second risk factor for glaucoma, after eye pressure, that can be modified by lifestyle, treatment or policy changes,"" Foster said. The findings were based on 111,370 participants of the UK Biobank study cohort, who underwent eye tests from 2006 to 2010 at sites across Britain. The participants underwent a test to measure intraocular pressure, and a laser scan of the retina to measure thickness of their eye's macula, the central area of the retina. The participants' data was linked to air pollution measures for their home addresses, with the researchers focusing on fine particulate matter, equal or less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter, or PM2.5. The team found that people in the most-polluted 25 per cent of areas were at least six per cent more likely to report having glaucoma than those in the least-polluted quartile. They were also significantly more likely to have a thinner retina, one of the changes typical of glaucoma progression, the researchers found. Eye pressure was not associated with air pollution, which the researchers said suggests that air pollution may affect glaucoma risk through a different mechanism. ""Air pollution may be contributing to glaucoma due to the constriction of blood vessels, which ties into air pollution's links to an increased risk of heart problems,"" said the study's first author, Sharon Chua from UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital. ""Another possibility is that particulates may have a direct toxic effect damaging the nervous system and contributing to inflammation,"" Chua said. The researchers noted that air pollution has been implicated in elevated risk of pulmonary and cardiovascular disease as well as brain conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke. Particulate matter exposure is one of the strongest predictors of mortality among air pollutants. The latest study adds to previous evidence that people in urban areas are 50 per cent more likely to have glaucoma than those in rural areas, suggesting that air pollution may be a key contributor to that pattern. ""We found a striking correlation between particulate matter exposure and glaucoma. Given that this was in the UK, which has relatively low particulate matter pollution on the global scale, glaucoma may be even more strongly impacted by air pollution elsewhere in the world,"" Foster said. ""And as we did not include indoor air pollution and workplace exposure in our analysis, the real effect may be even greater,"" he said.

461,IndiaTV News,https://www.indiatvnews.com/science/scientists-low-calorie-sugar-production-bacteria-566337,Scientists make low-calorie sugar using bacteria,"Published : Nov 25, 2019 14:46 IST, Updated : Nov 25, 2019 14:52 IST","Scientists make low-calorie sugar using bacteria Scientists have used bacteria to derive a sugar from fruits and dairy products that has only 38 per cent of the calories of traditional table sugar. The sugar called tagatose is approved by the US Food and Drugs Agency (FDA) as a food additive, and there have been no reports to date of the problems that many sugar substitutes have, such as a metallic taste, or links to cancer, according to the researchers at Tufts University in the US. The researchers said tagatose may be safe for diabetics, and will not cause tooth cavities. While derived from fruits and dairy products, tagatose is not abundant and is difficult to extract from those sources, they said. The manufacturing process involves a conversion from more easily obtained galactose to tagatose and is highly inefficient, with yields that may reach only 30 per cent, the researchers explained. In the study published in the journal Nature Communications, the researchers described a process that may unlock the commercial potential of this low-calorie, low-glycemic sugar. Assistant Professor Nikhil Nair and postdoctoral fellow Josef Bober, both from the Tufts University, came up with an innovative way to produce the sugar using bacteria as tiny bioreactors that encapsulate the enzymes and reactants. Using this approach, they achieved yields up to 85 per cent. Although there are many steps from the lab to commercial production, yields this high could lead to large-scale manufacturing and getting tagatose on every supermarket shelf, the researchers said. The enzyme of choice to make tagatose from galactose is called L-arabinose isomerase (LAI). However, galactose is not the main target for the enzyme, so the rates and yields of the reaction with galactose are less than optimal. In a solution, the enzyme itself is not very stable, and the reaction can only push forward until about 39 per cent of the sugar is converted to tagatose at 37 degrees Celsius, and only up to 16 per cent at 50 degrees Celsius, before the enzyme degrades. The researchers looked to overcome each of those hurdles through biomanufacturing, using Lactobacillus plantarum -- a food-safe bacterium -- to make large quantities of the LAI enzyme and keep it safe and stable within the confines of the bacterial cell wall. They found that when expressed in L. plantarum, the enzyme kept converting galactose to tagatose and pushed the yield to 47 per cent at 37 degrees Celsius. However, now that the LAI enzyme was stabilised within the cell, it could increase yield to 83 per cent at the higher temperature of 50 degrees Celsius without degrading significantly, and it was producing tagatose at a much faster rate, the researchers said. To determine if they could push the reaction even faster, Nair and Bober examined what might still be limiting it. They found evidence that the transport of the starting material, galactose, into the cell was a limiting factor. To resolve that issue, they treated the bacteria with very low concentrations of detergents -- just enough to make their cell walls leaky, according to the researchers. The galactose was able to get in and tagatose released from the cells, allowing the enzyme to convert galactose to tagatose at a faster rate, shaving a couple hours off the time needed to get to 85 per cent yield at 50 degrees Celsius, they said.

The roads are narrow, the sewerage system is unable to cope with the growing population and construction, renovation activities continue non-stop here. ""We have grown up seeing clouds of dust and garbage littered all around. Power cuts are frequent and majority of the shop keepers have diesel generator sets that emit smoke. ""The roads are congested at all times of the day but people are used to the conditions now. However, of late, there are more and more people complaining of burning sensation in eyes, short breath and even persistent cough. There is not too much awareness about pollution but I guess things are getting worse now,"" said another shop owner Mohd Ishtiaq from the parliamentary constituency of Prime MInister Narendra Modi. A physician, S.M.S Trivedi, who has a clinic in Ardhali Bazaar, admitted that the impact of increasing pollution levels was evident from the increase in a number of patients in almost all medical facility. ""Most people attribute the problems of changing the weather but it is actually pollution that is taking its toll. This is Prime Minister Narendra Modi's parliamentary constituency and before we get other facilities, we should be given fresh and clean air to breathe. ""Since air is not visible, the administration does not bother about it but the adverse impact of worsening pollution levels can cost one's life,"" he said. Most people in Varanasi attribute the increasing pollution levels to frequent power cuts and increasing construction work in the city.

""#Sydney is also known as the 'big smoke' and is living up to the nickname today. #Bushfire smoke will slowly ease during the day, increasing tonight. A Poor air quality alert is current,"" said the New South Wales Meteorology Office on Twitter. Government data of the state showed the air quality was ""poor"", although in some districts of the northwest the indexes of PM2.5 particles reached 130 and PM10 reached 195, reports Efe news. On AirVisual, a website that measures air quality around the world, Sydney ranked 18th at 1.30 pm, three down from Shanghai, with Bangladesh's Dhaka the worst at number one. The smoke that Sydney woke up to was from the fires of Gospers Mountain, about 300 km northwest of the city and which some 850 sq.km of land have been burned, greater than the area occupied by the capital city of Canberra. The impact of the smoke, which also affects the cities of Wollongong and Newcastle, is expected to worsen due to the intense heat expected in the next two days on the east coast of Australia, making conditions difficult for the more than 1,300 firefighters who have been fighting the flames for almost two weeks. At least six people have died from the bushfires in New South Wales, the region most affected by the blazes and where since July 13, 13,000 sq.km of land have been razed. Likewise, the neighbouring Queensland state and the south of South Australia have been forecast for temperatures around 40 degrees Celsius, which may aggravate active fires or create new outbreaks. The fire season in Australia varies by area and weather conditions, although blazes are generally recorded in the southern summer (between the months of December to March). The worst fires in the country in recent decades occurred in early February 2009 in the state of Victoria and caused 173 deaths, 414 injured, and burned an area of 4,500 sq.km.

Top officials of the environment ministry, DDA and municipal commissioners also stayed away from the deliberations. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Urban Development had called the meeting with top officials of various government departments to discuss the air pollution in Delhi and the measures required to reduce it. As many as 24 MPs from various parties did not attend the meeting, but the absence of Gambhir, the lone BJP leader from Delhi in the committee, snowballed into a political row as the AAP hit out at the saffron party over the issue and questioned its seriousness in tackling the crisis. Cricketer-turned-politician Gambhir has been vocal about the alarming levels of air pollution in Delhi and has called for measures to curb the menace. He was seen commentating on television on Friday in Indore, where a test match between India and Bangladesh is going on. As many as 24 parliamentarians from various parties, including the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress, did not attend the meeting. Hitting out at Gambhir, the Aam Aadmi Party, in a tweet, said while MPs like him were busy enjoying, AAP's Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Slngh attended the meeting. ""Gautam Gambhir, is this the level of your seriousness regarding air pollution,"" the Arvind Kejriwal-led party questioned. In a statement, Gambhir said his work spoke for him, adding that if by abusing him, Delhi's pollution levels came down, then the AAP was free to do so.
Besides Singh, the three other MPs who attended the meeting were BJP's Jagdambika Pal who heads the panel, CR Patil of the saffron party and Hasnain Masoodi of the National Conference. According to sources, the members of the panel who attended the meeting were extremely upset with the absence of the environment secretary, the DDA chairman and officials of the three municipal corporations of the national capital and planning to raise the issue with the Lok Sabha Speaker. The members told junior officials to convey to their seniors that they should have attended the meeting, the sources said. Asked about the absence of his ministry officials from the meeting, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said he would find out the details and investigate. ""We are always very serious about pollution. I have emphasised that pollution is not only Delhi's problem. I have ordered a joint action plan. Teams are working with coordination,"" he said. An official spokesperson said the environment ministry was represented at the meeting by the deputy secretary and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) officials, adding that the joint secretary could not attend it as she was to appear in an important matter in Supreme Court. The spokesperson also said detailed notes were submitted to the urban development ministry. One of the questions the panel members were planning to raise was: As there are about 50 lakh cars on the roads of Delhi, is the government
coming up with any sort of car pool policy or regulation? Another question was that according to the Union government, Rs 1,150 crore were given by the Centre to the states in the last one year to combat air pollution, along with 14,000 machines and does the government have a quantitative and qualitative utilisation report of the money disbursed? The third question to be raised pertained to the Supreme Court's recent observation that everybody, ranging from the secretary to the gram pradhan, will be held responsible for the losses due to air pollution and does the government, in this regard, intend to define and fix responsibility through an internal mechanism? The national capital is battling alarming levels of air pollution for the past few weeks. The air quality deteriorated further in the last four days, forcing the authorities to shut schools for two days.

The top court summoned the chief secretaries of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi over the prevailing air emergency in Delhi. The Supreme Court questioned the Delhi government over granting exemptions, including to two and three wheelers, during the Odd-Even scheme. The apex court said effective steps must be taken and 13 pollution hotspots in Delhi be cleared of pollutants. Slamming the Delhi government, Supreme Court observed that the Odd-even scheme might not be the solution to check air pollution. Delhi is suffering badly, the Air Quality Index is almost 600 even today, the court said. How do people breathe, the apex court asked. On being asked if there was any improvement in Delhi's air quality after the Odd-Even scheme, the Delhi Government responded saying that there has been a reduction in pollution levels by 5-15 per cent. However, the results would be better if the anti-pollution measure could be implemented without allowing any exemptions. Delhi Government put the onus on neighbouring states for the noxious smog that pushed Delhi towards an 'emergency zone'. The real culprit of Delhi pollution is stubble burning. Last year no study was done on impact of Odd-Even scheme, the top court said. Appearing for Delhi government, Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi told the top court that “if certain exemptions are removed that are given under the Odd-Even scheme, like 2 wheelers, it will help. We are trying to work it out further, if 2 wheelers won't be allowed, the city will come to a standstill.” The Supreme Court has asked Centre to prepare a road map for installation of air-purifying towers across Delhi to handle the air pollution crisis the National Capital is subjected to.

Millennials and GenZ are more likely to say this as compared to GenX respondents, said the survey by YouGov, an Internet-based market research and data analytics firm. Furthermore, when it comes to solving the air pollution problem, majority (61 per cent) said both the central and state government should be responsible for this. While one in six said the central government should look into this and almost as many feel it's the state government's concern. Delhi's air pollution has been making international headlines and while India endeavours to become a global super power, the state of air pollution in the national capital is ticking all the wrong boxes for global tourists, investors and international perception towards the country. On Friday, the air pollution emergency aggravated with the air quality index (AQI) spiking sharply to 528. With a PM 10 count of 583 and PM 2.5 count of 378, the air emergency has deteriorated sharply since Thursday. The pollution control authorities on Wednesday decided to shut down schools for two days after PM 2.5 levels stayed above 300 for two days running. According to the study, after environment, unemployment, education and women rights and safety are other issues relevant to people. While education is in the top three issues for everyone, the GenZ respondents seem to consider it more important than the other age groups. On the other hand, affordable basic services are more important to the older respondents as compared to the younger ones. The younger generation seems to be more trusting of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) to resolve most of their issues, while older respondents have more faith in the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) for handling their problems, said the study. The findings are based on responses from 750 residents in Delhi in the month of November. Data is representative of the adult online population in the state, YouGov said.

Among other Haryana districts, Faridabad (AQI 449), Gurugram (446), Jind (445), Fatehabad (430), Sirsa (415), Rohtak (412) and Panipat (408) also recorded their air quality in the ""severe"" category. In Punjab, air quality remained in ""very poor"" and ""poor"" categories. Amritsar's AQI was 362, followed by Bathinda (333), Patiala (285) and Jalandhar (276), the CPCB data said. AQI in the Union Territory of Chandigarh, the joint capital of the two states, was recorded at 242 which is considered as ""poor"". The Supreme Court Bench headed by Justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta sought the data from the date on which the Odd-Even Scheme in Delhi was introduced. The top court also sought day-to-day AQI data for the period between October 1 and December 31, 2018. The apex court took up the issue of air pollution in North India, and specifically the hazardous situation in Delhi. It had pulled up the Centre and the Delhi government for their inaction on the air pollution choking the national capital and surrounding areas. The AQI The court observed that ""no room in Delhi is safe"". Despite installing air purifiers, the PM 2.5 levels were at 500 and 600, indicating a grim situation. It also criticised the Centre over deteriorating air quality in Delhi while directing the government to find a solution to the problem of air pollution. The bench directed the central government to assess the feasibility of hydrogen-based fuel technology. ""In our view, little constructive efforts have been made by govt and other stakeholders to find a solution to the problem,"" the SC bench said as it noted that the whole of north India, NCR is suffering from the issue of air pollution. Meanwhile, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that odd-even scheme in Delhi that ends on Friday may get extended if needed. ""We are thinking about the odd-even scheme. If needed, we will extend it,"" Kejriwal said as air pollution level in Delhi remains in ""severe"" category. ""I am worried about the health of the people of Delhi. I am also concerned about the image of the city being projected in the world. Earlier this month, German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited Delhi, what image will she carry about the country's national capital,"" the Chief Minister said. As per Skymet AQI app data, Gurugram is the most polluted city in Delhi-NCR with four out of the five most polluted areas falling within the city. Sector 67, Gurugram, is the top polluted area in the Delhi NCR region with the Air Quality Index (AQI) count of 643.

The Deputy Commissioner of every district has appointed one nodal officer per village for management of stubble burning, it said. ""Every nodal officer of the district and Gram Panchayat shall be responsible to ensure that stubble is not burned in that village. The nodal officer in the Gram Panchayat shall be responsible for effective management of crop residue management. ""The government has decided to provide Rs 1,000 per acre operational charges for crop residue management for in-situ and ex-situ purposes,"" said an official communication to the Deputy Commissioners of the state by Additional Chief Secretary, Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department. The incentive will be given to only those small and marginal farmers who have sold their paddy after November 6 or will be selling their paddy till November 15 in the mandis which is procured by the government. The scheme is available to those farmers who have not burnt the crop residue. This amount will be released by the District Level Executive Committee after due verification by the village level nodal officer. The consolidated report shall be sent by the DCS to the office of ACS, Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department, Haryana, so that funds can be released to the concerned for reimbursement of the operational cost. Every district shall have one control room and nodal officer appointed for this purpose in the district.

The air pollution in the city became so toxic after Diwali fetivities that the Environmental Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) had declared a public health emergency in the Delhi-NCR and had advised people, especially children and the aged, to limit their exposure to the environment. While the AAP has blamed the stubble burning in neighbouring states for the high toxicity in the air, the opposition has blamed the ruling party for not taking concrete steps to control the air pollution. The Delhi unit of the Congress party is reminding the people the steps taken by the previous Sheila Dikshit-led government in her 15-year term to control pollution. Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee President Subhash Chopra has blamed both the BJP at the Centre and the AAP in Delhi for the pollution. He said air pollution is a 365-day problem, which is becoming a major public health emergency. ""The time has come when we have to fix accountability for this kind of situation which has arisen and is destroying right to life itself,"" he said. Chopra also said that the AAP should come clean and inform the people about the steps it has taken to prevent pollution in Delhi, adding the ""BJP government at Centre should have also sprung into action to deal with the crisis."" The Congress has already hit the streets and has started protests against the BJP and the AAP for air pollution. They held a demonstration outside the residence of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal as well, saying the severe pollution in Delhi is due to the inaction and failure of the AAP government and the BJP Government at the Centre and in the Municipal Corporations of Delhi. The Congress has trained its guns on the AAP, saying the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) had a fleet of 5,445 buses in 2012-13 when it was in power in the state, but the DTC fleet has come down to 3,600 buses by 2019 during the AAP Government. Chopra said the Kejriwal government has not only delayed Delhi Metro construction works but has also failed to add new buses to the depleted DTC fleet. The grand old party also said that under the late Shiels Dikshit, Delhi emerged as the greenest capital in the world. The AAP has been confident that its work done in the fields of health and education will be the driving force for the elections. Not just the Congress, the BJP too is attacking the AAP over the air pollutions. Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari claimed that the BJP government at the Centre had arranged construction of the Delhi Meerut Expressway. ""We ensured that the pollution is under control and so we kept 60,000 cars away from Delhi,"" he said. ""Pollution has reached such level that it has become difficult to breathe in the open air. The Chief Minister of Delhi has not been able to control dust pollution and pollution due to construction work and repair of roads, but he is trying to mislead the people by accusing other states of stubble burning to cover up his own failures,"" Tiwari said. Slamming the Kejriwal government, he said the people had given a massive mandate to the AAP so that it may be able to solve their problems. ""What to talk of solving the problems, the Chief Minister is misusing the public funds to promote himself. Why this government has not utilized 1,500 crore of environment cess for controlling pollution. Had proper steps been taken such a crisis may not have arisen,"" he added. The AAP's tenure will end in February 2020.

The study shows that people most exposed to fine particles have a higher CIMT index (carotid intima-media thickness) -- a marker of atherosclerosis -- which means they are at higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases such as stroke or heart attack. ""Our findings highlight the need to perform more studies on air pollution in low- and middle-income countries, since the conclusions may differ considerably from studies in high income countries due to differences in population characteristics and air pollution levels and sources,"" said researcher Cathryn Tonne from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal). It was published in the journal International Journal of Epidemiology. Previous studies indicate that inflammation and atherosclerosis are most likely responsible for the association between long-term exposure to air pollution and cardiovascular disease and mortality. For the findings, the research team picked India, a lower middle income country with high levels of air pollution. The study was performed with 3,372 participants from a periurban region of Hyderabad, Telangana, in southern India. The research team measured CIMT and estimated exposure to air pollution using an algorithm called land use regression (LUR) frequently used to predict the amount of fine particles (suspended particles with a diameter under 2.5 µm) in high-income countries. The participants also provided information on the type of cooking fuel they used. The results indicate that high annual exposure to ambient fine particles was associated with a higher CIMT, particularly in men, participants above 40 years of age, or those with cardiometabolic risk factors. Sixty per cent of participants used biomass cooking fuel. ""people using biomass fuel for cooking had a higher CIMT, particularly women who cooked in unventilated spaces."" In addition, ""women had a higher CIMT than men, which could be due to the fact that they spend more time in the kitchen, breathing air polluted by biomass fuel,"" study first author Otavio Ranzani, explained. According to the study, annual average exposure to PM2.5 was 32,7 µg/m3, far above the maximum levels recommended by the WHO (10 µg/m3). ""This study is relevant for countries which, like India, are experiencing a rapid epidemiological transition and a sharp increase in the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and obesity,"" Tonne said. ""In addition, the country is affected by high levels of air pollution, both ambient and indoors,"" Tonne added.

Measures are being taken to bring down the pollution levels, he said. The Air Quality Index (AQI) in Kolkata was recorded at 343, which falls in the 'very poor' category, at the green zone Fort William automated air monitoring station at 11 pm, according to the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) official. An AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good', 51-100 'satisfactory', 101-200 'moderate', 201-300 'poor', 301-400 'very poor' and 401-500 'severe'. An AQI above 500 falls in the 'severe plus' category.

The AQI at the Anand Bihar station was marginally better at 275, which falls under the 'poor' category, around the same time. A 'poor' AQI means breathing discomfort for most people on prolonged exposure.

Supreme Court's 5-point reprimand to states on pollution,"Published : Nov 06, 2019 17:46 IST, Updated : Nov 06, 2019 17:55 IST","Supreme Court/File The Supreme Court on Wednesday came down heavily on concerned state governments of Delhi, Punjab and Haryana over severe air pollution in the region. Delhi's air quality on Wednesday improved further from 'severe plus' to 'poor' as schools reopened in the national capital. This brought relief to people after a week as the AQI was recorded at 249 and the concentration of the particulate matter reading PM 10 at moderate levels. The PM 10 count is at 178 in the moderate category, seen after many days and the PM 2.5 count is at 105 in the poor category. There is a huge improvement over Tuesday's air quality also. The AQI stood at 356, PM 10 at 278 and PM 2.5 at 193 in the very poor category, on Tuesday. The overall situation is, however, grim. 1. Can you permit people to die like this due to pollution? Can you permit the country to go back by 100 years? 2. We have to make government responsible for this. Why can't government machinery stop stubble burning. 3. If you (state governments) don't bother about people, you have no right to be in power. 4. You just want to sit in your ivory towers and rule. You are not bothered and are letting people die. 5. You have forgotten the concept of welfare government. They are not bothered about poor people, this is very unfortunate. While many measures have been taken by authorities, the weather conditions are playing the most important part. Despite stubble burning in Punjab at its highest of the season, the wind speed in Delhi has done the reverse and helped the AQI to improve very sharply. According to an earlier forecast by Safar India, the AQI is rapidly recovering from the severe category largely due to faster winds to flush it out. The trend seen on Wednesday also emphasises the point that stubble burning is just one factor in the overall pollution paradigm.

However, a senior Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) official said the apex anti-pollution body has been keeping a close watch on the farm fires in Punjab which peaked to the season's high of 6,668 on Tuesday. The air quality index in the national capital dropped from 365 at 9.45 am to 309 at 9 pm, according to the Central Pollution Control Board. In the National Capital Region, Greater Noida (324), Noida (336), Ghaziabad (342), Faridabad (274) and Gurgaon (291) also recorded improvement in air quality. An AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good', 51-100 'satisfactory', 101-200 'moderate', 201-300 'poor', 301-400 'very poor' and 401-500 'severe'. An AQI above 500 falls in the 'severe plus' category. The India Meteorological Department said winds gusting up to 25 kmph were flushing out pollutants faster. ""There are good chances of rains in northwest India on Wednesday night and Thursday due to a western disturbance. The precipitation will cover Delhi-NCR, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and western Uttar Pradesh,"" head of IMD's regional weather forecasting centre of Kuldeep Srivastava, said. He said the situation will not be similar to that of Sunday when high humidity due to light rains led to the formation of more potent secondary particles. Secondary particles are product of complicated atmospheric reactions between primary particles — such as particulate matter, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide directly emitted by stubble burning and vehicles — in the presence of other factors such as sunlight and moisture. Examples of secondary particles include sulphates, nitrates, ozone and organic aerosols. Srivastava said visibility levels improved to 3,000-3,500 metres in the afternoon, which is considered normal. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said, ""The AQI is back to 'very poor' category after rapidly recovering from 'severe' largely due to faster boundary layer winds (40 kmph)."" Though Haryana and Punjab recorded 4,962 farm fires on Monday and north westerly winds, which carry smoke from stubble burning, continued to blow, Delhi air quality's ""continued to recover"", it said. ""It was mainly due to high transport-level wind speed which rapidly passed over Delhi without descending,"" SAFAR said. Meanwhile, Punjab on Tuesday reported the season's highest farm fire count at 6,668 as farmers continued to defy a ban imposed on stubble burning, triggering fears of upending the gradual improvement in air quality registered over the past two days. The Supreme Court on Monday ordered an immediate and complete stop to stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh blamed for 46 per cent of the pollution in Delhi-National Capital Region(NCR). According to satellite data collected by Punjab Remote-Sensing Centre, Sangrur and Bathinda were the worst-affected districts with the highest number of farm fire incidents of 1,007 and 945 on a single day, respectively. Between September 23 and November 5, Punjab reported 37,935 farm fires, which was almost 40 per cent higher than stubble burning incidents in the corresponding period last year. The Delhi government has repeatedly blamed stubble burning for the episodes of apocalyptic smog in Delhi every year. However, Prof. M S Swaminathan, the father of Green Revolution, has objected to people blaming farmers for the smog and high levels of pollution in Delhi-NCR. In a series of tweets on Monday he said, ""I suggest that the Delhi, Haryana and UP govts put up Rice BioParks where farmers can convert stubble into income and employment. We should stop blaming farmers since it will take us nowhere. Instead we should propose methods which are economically & ecologically desirable.""

A bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel expressed concern over the rise in waste burning incidents and noted that as against 5,000 sanitary inspectors, who are tasked to control burning in the city, only 50 are available. ""What is lacking is implementation. People are burning garbage in open, we have seen it with our eyes. A holistic solution to the problem has to be found. Use of technology can be invoked and drones can be put to use for preventing garbage burning,"" the bench said. The tribunal also suggested that if the corporations are suffering from manpower crunch, then authorities can employ unemployed youth and civil defense groups by paying them a token amount in lieu of their monitoring services. It said that the problem of deterioration in air quality is not a creation of just one day, but a result of continuous negligence and apathy in enforcing the law. There are acknowledged gaps in the existing undesirable situation and enforcement strategies in place. ""The past experience shows the deterioration of air quality in the months of October and November is a recurring phenomenon. It is not difficult to identify the causes and to have advance planned strategies to remedy the same. ""The causes and sources of air pollution may be crop burning, plastic burning, garbage burning, industrial emissions, vehicular emission, construction and debris waste, and pollution caused by crackers. A robust mechanism needs to be planned in the light of expert studies and remedying the failures in satisfactorily handling the situation in the past,"" the bench, also comprising Justices S P Wangdi and K Ramakrishnan, said. The tribunal was deliberating on the issue of air pollution in Delhi-NCR after taking cognisance of media reports that air quality has worsened. The NGT noted that the Supreme Court is already seized of the matter and said it would take up the issue thereafter.

The air quality index (AQI) in Greater Noida and Noida at 9.30 pm was 384 and 383 respectively, both still in ""very poor"" category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). However, the average AQI for the last 24 hours, recorded at 4 pm, were 428 in Greater Noida and 430 in Noida, both in the severe category, it stated. It was 495 in Noida and 482 in Greater Noida during the same period between Saturday and Sunday. An AQI between 301 and 400 falls in ""very poor"" category, meaning it causes respiratory illness on prolonged exposure, while an AQI above 400 qualifies as ""severe"" as it affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases, according to the CPCB. Schools across Gautam Buddh Nagar district remained closed and no construction activity was reported in compliance with the guidelines of the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, local officials said. While citizens grappling with the ""public health emergency"" preferred to stay indoors and markets witnessed low footfalls, local authorities carried out water sprinkling across the city roads. Some NGOs also distributed anti-pollution masks at public places. ""I had a mild asthma attack a day after Diwali. I required emergency treatment and the situation was controlled. The air quality over the days has been bad and we are staying indoors as much as possible,"" Atul Srivastava, a retired government official and resident of Sector 77, told PTI. Sushil Kumar Jain, president of Noida's Sector 18 market association, said a reduction in visitor's footfall has been there since Diwali but the numbers cannot be quantified. ""Usually the period after Diwali till the wedding season remains a little sluggish but certainly the pollution too is a major factor behind the current slowdown in visitors coming out to markets,"" Jain said. In Greater Noida, MLA Dhirendra Singh addressed public meetings as he reached out to school children and encouraged their participation in raising awareness about the alarming weather situation in the region. On Saturday, the BJP MLA was joined by 250 school girls as they carried out a plantation drive in Rabupura area. ""We all are aware of the pollution situation in Delhi-NCR. So it has to be a collective effort from the public also and little required changes must come from all of us to ensure improvement in the situation,"" Singh said.

Gautam Buddh Nagar and Ghaziabad administrations said the decision has been taken as the levels of particulate matter 2.5 and 10 have been excessive in the air since Diwali, resulting in a major dip in the overall air quality. ""Transport vehicles like buses and minibuses, which a lot of schools use to ferry children, are a major contributor of PM 2.5 and PM 10. The movement of such vehicles in the city now could aggravate the situation,"" District Magistrate B N Singh said in a written order. ""Hence, it is ordered that all schools up to Class 12 in Gautam Buddh Nagar will remain closed on November 4 and 5,"" he added. A similar order was passed by Ghaziabad District Magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey, noting that the pollution was impacting the health of children. In Haryana, the School Education Department issued an order to deputy commissioners of Gurgaon and Faridabad asking them to ensure closure of all government, private and aided schools on Monday and Tuesday. According to Central Pollution Control Board data, the average air quality index from Saturday to Sunday at 4 pm in Noida was 495, 482 in Greater Noida, 491 in Ghaziabad, 486 in Gurgaon and 496 in Faridabad, all in ""severe"" category, which means it affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases.

The air purifier van deployed by the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) has capacity to purify 15 lakh cubic metre air in eight hours within a 300 metre radius, they said. ""Looking at the developing situation and consistent deterioration in air quality, a mobile air purifier van has been deployed at the west gate of the Taj Mahal,"" Regional Officer of UPPCB Bhuvan Yadav told PTI. Pollution around the white marble mausoleum has been a cause of concern for a long time as it has been damaging the monument, one of the seven wonders of the world. The district administration, Agra Nagar Nigam and UPPCB collaborated with telecom operator Vodafone-Idea, as part of corporate social responsibility efforts, to bring in two such air purifier vans to the city to combat pollution, the officials said. The vans were brought to Agra on October 24 and looking at the fast deteriorating air quality in the city, one of them has now been deployed near the Taj Mahal to protect it from air pollution, Yadav said. At present there is no continuous air monitoring station around the Taj Mahal to help calculate the AQI so the magnitude of how much air has been purified cannot be determined, the officials said. However, there is a monitoring station at Sanjay Palace in the city, which showed an AQI of 293 at 4pm, according to the Central Pollution Control Board. An AQI between 201-300 is considered 'poor' and causes breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. Several north Indian cities have been battling tremendous levels of pollution over the past few days, prompting authorities to declare health emergency in Delhi.

Pollution levels in Delhi crossed the 900 mark despite the rain the strong winds It was expected that light showers and strong winds would help to improve the air quality in the capital but it has not been the case thus far. Earlier, public health emergency was declared in Delhi and schools were asked to remain shut till Tuesday, November 5. It remains to be seen whether that deadline is pushed further back. As data above shows, most parts of Delhi are suffering from an abnormally high AQI reading and smog has taken over the streets of the national capital. The situation is equally grim in the neighbouring cities in the NCR. On Sunday, all the pollution measuring stations in Delhi-NCR showed a severe pollution level but on a very higher side.

The most deteriorated air quality, 486, was recorded at ITO. Most areas recorded an AQI of above 450 on Sunday morning. The share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution reduced from 44 per cent on Friday, the season's highest, to 17 per cent on Saturday, government air quality monitor SAFAR said. A Supreme Court-mandated panel declared a public health emergency in Delhi-NCR on Friday in view of alarming levels of air pollution and imposed a ban on all construction activities till November 5. Earlier, the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority had banned construction activities only for the period between 6 pm and 10 am till November 2. Now, no construction can take place even in the day time. While Skymet had predicted that parts of Delhi-NCR would receive light showers on Saturday evening, experts said air pollution would remain as bad as it has been for the past few days and people would have to wait for five more days for a good amount of rain. While the drizzles cannot dilute the pollutants, it has been expected that the NCR could witness a good amount of rain along with good wind speed facilitating respite from bad air on November 7 and 8.

The severe air pollution causing health emergency in Delhi that has grabbed international headlines, may dissipate by Saturday-Sunday as favourable weather conditions is forecast that may cause a slow recovery in its air quality index (AQI). The toxic haze covering Delhi's skies is that for three weeks stagnant conditions caused by delayed withdrawal of the monsoon had caused a deterioration due to accumulation of pollutants. This impact is ending now, according to Safar India (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research), under the Ministry of Earth Sciences and Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune. While AQI in Delhi is in the severe plus category, the highest grade of computation at 435, the US Embassy is denoting a sharp improvement in PM 2.5 levels compared to the peak values on Friday of 454. On Saturday, the PM 2.5 count at 9 a.m. has halved at 208, according to US Embassy data. According to the forecast by Safar India, the overall air quality of Delhi continues to be in the severe plus. However, as the winds have become westerly from Saturday the further intrusion will be less and slow recovery is expected. ""The AQI is expected to remain in severe category today morning but likely to be recovering further by evening towards upper end of very poor,"" it said. A fresh Western Disturbance is likely to advance to eastern regions of northwest India on Saturday, which is likely to positively influence Delhi's air quality by increasing surface and boundary layer winds speed and thereby flushing out the accumulated pollutants. ""SAFAR extended outlook has warned 3 weeks back about the chance of high deterioration in AQI of Delhi during last week of Oct to first week of November for prolonged periods mainly due to delayed withdrawal of monsoon forcing stagnant conditions beneath to arrest any external intrusion for longer period. This impact appears to be ending now, it said. The worrisome part is that biomass burning in Punjab and Haryana hit a new peak with a contribution of 44 per cent in air pollution but that is expected to dissipate. The effective stubble fire counts of North west India (Haryana & Punjab) touched a new peak value of this year (3,178) Friday. The accumulation of pollutants sharply increased and stubble share in Delhi's PM2.5 touched season's high of 44 per cent on October 31 as against the expected 25 per cent. The share is predicted to drop down to 18 per cent by Saturady owing to increase in ventilation index dispersing it. ""By November 3 significant improvement to the very poor is expected,"" the forecast said.

Pollution levels in the region entered the ""severe plus"" category on Friday, with the Supreme Court-mandated pollution control body EPCA declaring a public health emergency in Delhi-NCR and banning construction activity till November 5. With poor air quality prevailing in the national capital for the past three days, there has been a rise in the number of patients visiting out-patient departments (OPDs) or emergencies with respiratory or cardiac related problems. ""Patients are coming with complaints of watery eyes, cough, breathing difficulty, allergy, exacerbation of asthma and and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD),"" AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria said, adding that children and those above the age of 60 are the worst affected when the pollution levels are high. Besides affecting lungs, high levels of pollutants in the atmosphere cause inflammation in blood vessels and may lead to hardening of arteries which can act as a trigger for stroke or heart attack in persons, already at risk of the disease, Guleria explained. Vijay Gurjar, assistant professor in the Department of Geriatrics at AIIMS, said that there is around 20-25 per cent rise in footfall of elderly patients suffering from several health issues due to pollution, both at the casualty and OPDs. Air pollution exacerbates lung conditions and aggravates the condition of those having pre-existing health issues such as asthma, pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. ""Those who could be stabilised with medication are now requiring admissions for stabilisation,"" Gurjar said.

""I have started writing it on prescriptions now -- 'please stay indoor' and 'avoid morning walks',"" Gurjar said. The Delhi government has announced that all schools will be shut till November 5 in the wake of rising level of pollution.
Doctors at several private hospitals also reported around 25-30 per cent rise in footfall of patients at the OPDs and emergencies. According to Dr Abhinav Guliani, chest physician at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, there has been a sudden increase of almost 25-30 per cent patients in the casualty and OPD with breathing difficulty, cough, chest heaviness and infections after Diwali. Most of the patients coming to the hospital belong to the age group 3-12 years and above 60 years. The number of patients with existing lung diseases requiring admission has also increased. ""Some of the patients coming to the casualty with these problems are severe enough requiring admission,"" Guliani said.

According to SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research) India, the Air Quality Index (AQI) docked at 412 in Delhi which falls in the ""severe"" category. A Central Pollution Control Board official said the AQI entered the ""severe plus"" or ""emergency"" category late Thursday night, the first time since January this year. If the air quality persists in the ""severe plus"" category for more than 48 hours, emergency measures such as odd-even car rationing scheme, banning entry of trucks, construction activities and shutting down schools are taken under the Graded Response Action Plan, the official said. The hazardous pollution levels forced a number of people to miss morning walks and other activities. Shubhomoy Sikdar, a Delhi-based journalist, said the pollution levels gave him a throat infection and he had to skip his daily sports session. Amanpreet Singh, a resident of Jangpura, said he has been avoiding morning and evening walks and preferring to stay indoors. The number of masked faces continued to grow as the city remained shrouded in a pungent haze for the fourth consecutive day. At 8.30 am, the capital's overall air quality index stood at 459. It was 410 at 8 pm on Thursday. All the 37 air quality monitoring stations across Delhi recorded the air quality in the severe category on Friday morning. Bawana was the most-polluted area with an AQI of 497, followed by Delhi Technological University (487), Wazirpur (485), Anand Vihar (484) and Vivek Vihar (482). Neighbouring Ghaziabad was the most polluted city in the country, with the levels of PM2.5 -- tiny particulate matter less than 2.5 microns that can enter deep into the lungs -- reaching as high as 493. Greater Noida (480), Noida (477), and Faridabad (432) also breathed extremely polluted air. An AQI between 0-50 is considered “good”, 51-100 “satisfactory”, 101-200 “moderate”, 201-300 “poor”, 301-400 “very poor”, and 401-500 “severe”. Above 500 is “severe-plus or emergency” category. Delhi is impatiently hoping for favourable meteorological conditions to blow away the toxic air, as health experts said the hazardous air pollution has become a serious health concern for about 2 crore residents. ""Intake of every 22 micrograms per cubic metre of polluted air is equivalent to smoking a cigarette. So whether the PM2.5 level is 700 or 300 units, the impact is still as bad. People need to take precautions, especially those suffering from asthma, bronchitis or other respiratory illness,"" said Dr Arvind Kumar, lung surgeon at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. Weather experts said increased wind speed due to a fresh western disturbance approaching the northern region would help disperse pollutants faster from Saturday. Parents are a worried lot as health experts say children breathe faster, taking in more pollutants. Many took to Twitter to demand that schools be shut till the situation ameliorates. ""We, as parents, request Delhi government to keep all schools (pvt and govt) shut for the time being,"" Anil Atri, a Delhi resident, posted on the microblogging site. ""Whole Delhi air at hazardous levels now. Pollution at its peak. Activate all emergency measures. Close down schools @msisodia (sic),"" another resident tweeted. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had on Wednesday said the decision to shut schools would be taken ""when the need arises"". In November 2017, the government had shut schools for a few days due to the deteriorating air quality. The government, however, started distributing 50 lakh N95 masks, considered one of the good quality masks for tackling smog, among school students in Delhi on Friday morning. Meanwhile, the BCCI said it would carry on with the India-Bangladesh T20 at the Feroz Shah Kotla grounds on Sunday, disregarding concerns raised by environmentalists about the health of players and thousands of spectators. The AQI takes into account five chief pollutants -- particulate matter with a diameter less than 10 micrometres (PM10), PM2.5, ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO). The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and health concerns.

Dr Vijay Dutt of internal medicine at the Indian Spinal Injuries Centre said, post Diwali, Delhi's air becomes more hazardous to inhale and the pollutants will harm everyone, but most vulnerable are asthma patients, pregnant women, the elderly and children. ""Some of the precautionary methods would be to wear a mask while going outside and the right mask needs to be worn. I would advice to avoid surgical and comfort masks as it don't allow proper respiratory protection.

The overall AQI oscillated between 410 and 420 during the day, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the Delhi government will start distributing masks among school students from Friday following a spike in the pollution level. Fifty lakh N95 masks would be given to students in both government and private schools in Delhi, he said on Wednesday.

Several parts of Delhi experienced ''severe"" air pollution on Tuesday. Anand Vihar was the most-polluted area with an AQI of 436 and Nehru Nagar following with an AQI of 430. An Air Quality Index between 401-500 falls into ""severe"" category and anything beyond that is ""severe-plus emergency"". The AQI takes into account five chief pollutants, including the PM10 and PM2.5. The higher the AQI value, the greater the health concern. Delhi is going through a bad period with reference to ambient air quality after celebrating one of the cleanest Diwali in last few years, the government said. Meanwhile, the air quality in Delhi was recorded as 'severe' on Wednesday.

Two days before Diwali, the national capital's air quality dropped to season's worst on Friday, with the decreased wind speed leading to accumulation of pollutants and affecting dispersion. The Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority is expected to take a call on Friday on several recommendations made by a 10-member anti-pollution task force. The recommendations include banning construction work at night in Delhi-NCR from October 26 to 30 and closure of industries that have not switched to piped natural gas. The city's overall air quality index (AQI) stood at 315 at 8:30 am on Friday, while it was 311 on Thursday evening. Most of the places in the national capital recorded the AQI in the ""very poor"" category, while the situation inched towards ""severe"" in some areas. The AQI in Nehru Nagar, Ashok Vihar, Jahangirpuri, Rohini, Wazirpur, Bawana, Mundka and Anand Vihar was 340, 335, 339, 349, 344, 363, 381 and 350, respectively, according to Central Pollution Control Board's data. The AQI in the neighbouring towns of Baghpat, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Gurgaon, and Noida was 312, 336, 311, 312 and 320, respectively. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality forecast and research service, SAFAR, said, ""The decrease in wind speed has started to negatively influence Delhi's air quality by drastically decreasing ventilation coefficients and thereby affecting dispersion."" Calm surface winds will continue for the next two days. Consequently, the AQI is predicted to oscillate between high and middle range of the ""very poor"" category, it said. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said another western disturbance is likely to affect the western Himalayan region by October 28. In view of this, the situation on Diwali may not be as bad as last year. A 10-member task force on the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) recommended on Thursday that construction activities in Delhi and satellite towns of Gurgaon, Faridabad, Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad, Sonepat and Bahadurgarh be banned between 6 pm and 6 am from October 26 to October 30. The task force, headed by Central Pollution Control Board Member Secretary Prashant Gargava, also recommended closure of coal-based industries, barring power plants, in these satellite towns during the period. ""In Delhi, industries which have not yet shifted to piped natural gas will remain closed from October 26 to 30,"" it said and asked all implementing agencies to take strict action for checking stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana and ensure enforcement of the Supreme Court's directions regarding firecrackers and impound ""visibly"" polluting vehicles. All these measures are part of the CPCB-formulated Graded Response Action Plan, which lists stricter anti-pollution measures to be followed according to the severity of the situation. Green firecrackers, developed by a gamut of laboratories led by CSIR-NEERI, have finally hit the markets, albeit in less quantity, mainly due to delay in finalising chemical compositions and granting manufacturing licences. With Delhi's air quality plummeting to dangerous levels around Diwali every year, the Supreme Court last year banned polluting firecrackers and ordered that only green firecrackers, which cause 30 per cent less pollution, can be manufactured and sold. The Delhi government has also prepared a dust action plan, under which officials have been regularly visiting construction sites, ensuring sprinkling of water to prevent dust emission and carrying out an immediate repair of roads, according to Delhi Environment Minister Kailash Gahlot. The Delhi government is also going to distribute five million N95 anti-pollution masks to students in government and private schools. The CPCB also has a 15-day plan for the critical period between November 1 and November 15, when pollution levels are maximum in Delhi-NCR, in the works.

The air quality index (AQI) on Wednesday was recorded at 244 against Tuesday's 206, according to the data available with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research Institute (SAFAR) said that the high wind speed will positively influence Delhi's air quality. ""A slight decrease in the stubble burning activity in Haryana and Punjab has been noticed over the last 24 hours,"" it also said. ""The surface, as well as boundary layer winds, are forecast to change direction to easterly by tomorrow afternoon. This will decrease the biomass pollutant share in the Delhi region which is relatively very low so far,"" the SAFAR said. It said that no drastic deterioration in air quality is expected for the next two days. ""Looking at present forecast of weather parameters in SAFAR model simulations, air quality during Diwali period is likely to be not as bad as last year which is being followed closely and clear forecast will be issued on October 25. AQI is forecast to be in the same lower end of the poor category,"" it said. The authorities said that high deterioration in AQI of Delhi is only expected by the first week of November. ""The repeated western disturbances are expected in the last week of October, which is likely to positively influence Delhi's air quality. ""According to the current analysis, the situation on Diwali may not be as bad as last year. SAFAR will update its analysis in the coming days.

According to the data shared by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on air quality index on Thursday, Sirsa in Haryana were recorded the most polluted with a AQI score of 342. This was followed by three places in Uttar Pradesh - Sahibabad at 315, Moradabad at 305, Ghaziabad at 295 - and Jind in Haryana at 295, which were more polluted compared to Delhi's score of 284. Other places which reported poor air quality were Noida with a score of 283, Gurugram (279), Meerut (269), Greater Noida (266), Palwal (260), Rohtak (259), Patna (256) and Manesar at 252. The scores of the air quality index are calculated at an average of the past 24 hours. The air quality index (AQI) scores fluctuate over days and a particular place may have a higher or lower pollution level on a given day. However, the broad trend of quality of air would remain consistent. There seems to be a north-south divide on pollution. While the most polluted places are in the north, the best air quality is dominated by southern towns and cities. As per CPCB data, there are few places in the country, dominated by the south, with good air quality. Haldia with an AQI score of 20, Chikkaballapur 26, Ramanagara 27, Tirupati 31, Visakhapatnam 34, Shillong 35, Mysuru 40, Amaravati 41, Thiruvananthapuram 49, and Rajamahendravaram 49 were among the few places monitored for pollution that had good air quality on Thursday.

Kuching (Malaysia), Hanoi, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta and Singapore topped the list of major cities with the highest air pollution levels in the world according to Air Visual, a platform that measures the Air Quality Index (AQI) worldwide. However, the highest levels of air pollution were recorded in rural areas, reports Efe news. Simpang, in Indonesia's Sumatra island, surged to the ""Hazardous"" category of 372 on the AQI, with the density of PM2.5 particles at 322.6 micrograms per cubic meter. PM2.5 are harmful ultrafine particles that measure 2.5 micrograms or less in diameter. The World Health Organization recommends that levels should not exceed 25 micrograms per cubic meter. Sri Aman on the Malaysian part of the Borneo Island, stood at 367 on the AQI and recorded PM2.5 levels of 317.2 micrograms per cubic meter. AQI levels of 151 and above are considered unhealthy, especially for children, the elderly and the sick; it is advisable to stay indoors once they are reached. Most of the smoke affecting Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore billowed from forest fires and plantations on Indonesian territory, mainly in Sumatra and Borneo. More than 2,000 people have received medical treatment in Kalimantan, in Indonesian Borneo, for respiratory problems due to smoke inhalation. Indonesian authorities arrested more than 180 people on Monday and were investigating more than 30 companies - some in the palm oil industry - for their possible role in the fires. The blaze began at the beginning of the country's dry season in June, and more than 9,000 firefighters and volunteers have since worked to extinguish it. Indonesian media reported that two people had died - including a baby - from inhaling the toxic fumes rising from the fire that has ravaged Sumatra in recent weeks. In Malaysia, the Education Ministry has ordered the closure of 138 schools in Selangor state this week and another 56 in Port Dickson due to the poor air quality. Hanoi has been witnessing alarming levels of smog mainly due to pollution from nearby coal plants and road traffic.

By contrast, worsening air pollution caused New Delhi to drop six places to 118th and Cairo to fall two places to 125th. Mumbai fell two places to 119 because of a low score in the culture category. According to the annual index compiled by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the Austrian capital is the most liveable city in the world. On the EIU's index, Vienna scored a near-perfect 99.1 out of 100, putting it just ahead of Melbourne. Sydney and Osaka were third and fourth in the list dominated by Australian, Canadian and Japanese cities. Accoring to Norbert Kettner, CEO, Vienna Tourist Board, to see Vienna again listed as number one in EIU's ""Global Livability Ranking"" brings both joy and honour. ""It is an achievement which we will continue to strive towards maintaining in the years to come. To attain the world's highest quality of life is a result of hard work and efficient collaborations of all players within the city,"" he said. Vienna attracted 40,509 Indian visitors between January-July 2019, representing an increase of nearly 9 per cent over the same period last year. Global Liveability Index ranking of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), published annually since 2004, enjoys global recognition and compares 140 cities around the world. In all, 27 cities have become more liveable by the EIU's reckoning, whereas 15 saw their scores fall. The biggest improvement came in San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, which rose 20 places to 69th - but that owed much to investments in health care and infrastructure after the devastation wrought by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017.

Conducted over a 30-year period, the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, analysed data on air pollution and mortality in 652 cities across 24 countries and regions. The researchers found that increases in total deaths are linked to exposure to inhalable particles (PM10) and fine particles (PM2.5) emitted from fires or formed through atmospheric chemical transformation. ""As there's no threshold for the association between particulate matter (PM) and mortality, even low levels of air pollution can increase the risk of death,"" said Yuming Guo, Professor at Monash University in Australia. ""The smaller the airborne particles, the more easily they can penetrate deep into the lungs and absorb more toxic components causing death,"" Guo said. Though concentrations of air pollution in Australia are lower than in other countries, the study found that Australians are more sensitive to particulate matter air pollution and cannot effectively resist its adverse impacts. ""Given the extensive evidence on their health impacts, PM10 and PM2.5 are regulated through the World Health Organisation (WHO) Air Quality Guidelines and standards in major countries,"" Guo added. The results suggest that the levels of particulate matter below the current air quality guidelines and standards are still hazardous to public health.

Women who are exposed to high pollution levels in India are at significantly higher risk of suffering from hypertension, warn researchers. The research, published in the journal Epidemiology, studied 5,531 adults from 28 peri-urban villages near Hyderabad city. ""Women spend most of their time near their households in this study area - 83 per cent of their daily time as compared to 57 per cent for men -- which could explain why we observe a stronger association in women than in men"", said study author Ariadna Curto from Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), Spain. For the study, the research team measured systolic and diastolic blood pressure of participants and estimated their annual residential exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon. The participants also answered a survey to determine socio-economic status, lifestyle and household characteristics, including the type of cooking fuel which they generally used (biomass or clean). Notably, all participants were exposed to fine particulate matter levels above the 10 µg/m³ limit recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Average exposure to PM2.5 in this study was 33 µg/m3. Based on the blood pressure measurements, almost half of participants (46 per cent) were identified as hypertensive, with high proportions of participants with undiagnosed and untreated hypertension. The results show that an increase of 1µg/m3 in PM2.5 exposure was associated with a 4 per cent increase in hypertension prevalence in women as well as a higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure - an increase of 1.4 mmHg and 0.87 mmHg respectively. In men, the association observed was weaker. The research indicates that long-term exposure to particulate matter is associated with a higher prevalence of hypertension, regardless of the type of fuel used for cooking. ""In the light of our lack of association with black carbon, it is important to keep in mind that this is a peri-urban area, where the sources and chemical makeup of air pollution differ to urban areas mostly dominated by traffic sources"", Curto said. The mechanisms by which air pollution could contribute to high blood pressure ""include inflammation and oxidative stress, which may lead to changes in arterial function"", said study coordinator Cathryn Tonne.

The step comes in the wake of rising air pollution linked to intense heat wave that strikes most of French regions, the city's police department announced on Tuesday. Commenting on the development, Paris police prefecture said only electric vehicles and those with clean air stickers 1 and 2 are allowed to enter the French capital on June 26 from 5:30 a.m. local time to midnight. The other vehicles, mostly older and diesel cars, will be prevented from circulating in Paris following the unusual heatwave. Amid an expected high level of ozone pollution linked to rising temperatures, speed limits will also be cut by 20 kilometer per hour in Paris and Ile-de-France on Wednesday, while vehicles weighing over 3.5 tonnes will be asked to bypass the city centre and nearby surroundings completely. In addition, the Paris police department has called on businesses that use polluting machinery to reduce operations and avoid using solvent-based products, such as acetone, varnishes, glues or paints. Like major Western European countries where unprecedented high temperatures will appear in at least the next six days, France is set to witness unseasonable temperatures which could even exceed 38 degrees Celsius in parts of eastern and southern regions in the coming days. Meanwhile, Meteo France predicts 34 degrees Celsius in the French capital for Wednesday. The temperature could even reach up to 39 degrees by Friday afternoon. Meteo France has put 65 departments, including Ile-de-France (Paris and its suburb), under orange alert due to an intense heatwave and decided to maintain the alert system in these areas till Wednesday afternoon.

The report by the environment organization Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) revealed that outdoor and household air pollution together are causing deadly diseases. ""Air pollution is now the third highest cause of death among all health risks ranking just above smoking in India. This is a combined effect of outdoor particulate matter (PM) 2.5, ozone and household air pollution. ""Due to this combined exposure, South Asians, including Indians are dying early - their life expectancy has reduced by over 2.6 years. This is much higher than the global tally of reduced life expectancy by an average of 20 months. While globally a child born today will die 20 months sooner on an average than would be expected without air pollution in India they would die 2.6 years earlier,"" the report released by the CSE said. While exposure to outdoor particulate matter (PM) accounted for a loss of nearly one year and six months in life expectancy, exposure to household air pollution accounted for a loss of nearly one year and two months, according to the CSE. ""Thus, together Indians lose 2.6 years,"" it said. The report said household air pollution contributes about a quarter of the outdoor air pollution in the country. ""The deadly tally broken up by diseases shows that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to air pollution at 49 per cent is responsible for close to half of deaths, followed by lung cancer deaths at 33 per cent, diabetes and ischaemic heart disease at 22 per cent each and stroke at 15 per cent. It is disturbing how COPD, lung cancer and ischaemic heart disease dominate the dubious tally,"" it said. The report referred to two review papers by scientists from the Forum of International Respiratory Societies and said air pollution can harm acutely as well as chronically, potentially affecting every organ in the body. ""According to the study, ultra-fine particles pass through lungs are taken up by cells and carried via the bloodstream to expose virtually all cells in the body. Air pollution may be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body, according to a comprehensive new global review recently reported,"" the CSE said. The research shows head-to-toe harm, from heart and lung disease to diabetes and dementia, and from liver problems, brain, intelligence, abdominal organs, reproduction, and bladder cancer to brittle bones and damaged skin. Fertility, foetuses and children are also affected by toxic air, it said. None of the officials from government authorities was available for comment. Recently, on World Environment Day, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said the number of 'poor' air quality days have come down from 300 in 2014 to 206 this year. Previous environment minister Harsh Vardhan earlier rejected a global report on air pollution as per which 1.2 million people died in the country due to air pollution.

The theme of the World Environment Day, 2019, was air pollution. Under the scheme, the government will fix a cap on emissions as advised by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board and then allow industries to buy and sell permits to maintain their emissions below the cap. The Gujarat Pollution Control Board has started the scheme first in Surat as a pilot. A team of researchers from the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), the Economic Growth Center at Yale University and others from The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), have devised the ETS. According to the scheme, the GPCB will first define the total mass of pollution that can be released into the air over a certain fixed period by all industrial units together. This will be equivalent to the cap. The permits would then become units which could be bought and sold under the ETS. ""This is like the commodities you trade on the national commodity exchange,"" a senior GPCB official said. Officials explained that the pollution board picked Surat since it is a densely-populated industrial center and the textiles and dyeing houses there produce heavy air pollution. The ETS will be implemented in a phased manner across 350 industrial units in Surat. According to GPCB Chairman Rajiv Gupta, around 150 industrial units are expected to trade on the national commodities exchange on July 1 as a test case. He added that from August, the ETS would come into effect for all industrial units in Surat.

The report said India is facing a strong opportunity for controlling air pollution and introduces China's rapid progress in air quality management from 2013 to 2017. It also identifies suggestions referencing China's experience for Indian air quality management efforts currently underway. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has chosen air pollution as the theme for this year's World Environment Day that falls on June 5 with China as the host country. Chinese environmental think tank Bluetech Clean Air Alliance released a report -- ""Gaining a rapid win against air pollution: How India can make use of China's experience"" -- sharing China's experience that can be relevant to the Indian context in tackling high pollution levels. As India enters the implementation stage of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), a plan which aims to bring down particulate pollution by 20-30 per cent across 102 cities in five years, experts at Bluetech Clean Air Alliance claim the predicament and questions were similar in China when the government issued the National Clean Air Action Plan (2013-17). The targets and ambition set by the Chinese government required it to achieve significant air quality improvement in five years, comparable to the reduction Europe and the US achieved in decades. This was considered an impossible mission and at the cost of slowing down economic growth, an expert said. Yet, China successfully achieved all the air targets planned with continuous growth of economy. The particulate matter levels were reduced by over 22 per cent across China, and highly polluted Beijing and surrounding region saw a 40 per cent improvement. Being two of the world's largest economies and most populous countries, India and China's battles against air pollution have global attention and spotlight. Combined, the two countries also have a population of over two billion people who are facing adverse health impacts of polluted air. Bluetech Clean Air Alliance head Tonny Xie said: ""Strong political will and top level commitment from the government played fairly important roles in achieving clean air goals."" ""In 2013, the Chinese premier declared a war against pollution, signalling a new era in environmental management. This paradigm shift meant more frequent and stronger policies and regulation. Nearly 300 national policies, appearing in different forms as regulations, sectoral standards and plans, had been rolled out from 2013 to 2017."" Based on China's experience, the report said India should consider strong political commitment and belief by the top echelons of decision making in the country in the benefits of air quality improvement. Also, well designed science-based policy making towards developing emission inventory, data monitoring, air quality modelling, source apportionment and cost benefit analysis to ensure most optimal and prioritized action plans. It also favours implementation targets of air quality programs designed with adequate consideration to regional air sheds where sources of pollution are nearly similar. Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends -- a communications initiative which partnered with Bluetech Clean Air Alliance to bring the Chinese study to India -- said: ""As two countries with starkly different political systems, India and China differ fundamentally in how policies are set and implemented."" ""Yet, with bad air as a common, Indian decision making could borrow aspects of Chinese success, and combine it with a more participatory approach and an Indian way of finding a solution to the problem. ""This will mean close coordination among the Centre, the states and the municipal corporations. No success is possible unless there isn't agreement with the different levels of decision making, which is a necessary first step,"" she said.

Navakanta Bhat, a professor at Indian Institute of Science, Bangaluru, has devised gas sensors with ultra-precise detection accuracies necessary for environmental monitoring. ""With the growing air pollution worldwide, today clean and fresh air is becoming a luxury and premium. If the air pollution continues unabated, it will have very serious and debilitating health implications,"" Bhat told PTI on the eve of World Environment Day on June 5. He noted that some cities such as Delhi have seen growing incidence of respiratory diseases including bronchitis, severe asthma attack to name a few. ""Unless the citizens are aware of the quality of air that they are breathing, they will not be compelled to take stern actions and remedial measures,"" said Bhat, who was awarded the 2018 Infosys Science Prize for his work on the design of novel biosensors. He noted, in this context Air Quality Monitoring (AQM) at every location, becomes extremely important to provide quantitative metrics on various pollutants in the ambient air around us. Today, the typical air quality sensors used in pollution monitoring stations are very bulky, extremely expensive and cannot be scaled as they are based on optical absorption spectroscopy principle. Using nanomaterials, the team has been able to achieve detection limit down to ppb (parts per billion) concentration level. This technology is scalable, analogous to silicon electronics chip technology and hence can achieve very low cost and high performance. ""In fact, we have been able to develop a single chip with four different sensing elements, capable of detecting CO2, CO, NO2 and SO2,"" Bhat said. According to a 2017 Lancet study, air pollution kills over one million people in India annually. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared air pollution as a ""public health emergency"" across the globe. In addition to causing severe diseases and mortality, air pollution can also contribute to global warming or climate change. S K Satheesh, Professor at Indian Institute of Science, studies black carbon aerosols, the dark, light absorbing, microscopic particles in air which greatly influence the energy balance of the atmosphere over the Indian subcontinent. Satheesh noted that atmospheric aerosols are of both natural and man-made origin. Black carbon (BC) is considered as the most important climate-relevant aerosol species due to its high-absorption properties and consequent atmospheric warming potential, said Satheesh. Black carbon is mainly produced from burning of biomass and fossil fuels. Vehicular emissions and coal-fired thermal power plants are examples of black carbon aerosol sources. ""We have shown that this leads to strong north-south gradients in aerosol-induced warming at higher levels,"" Satheesh, who was also awarded by the Infosys Science Foundation (ISF), told PTI. ""Our experiments using high-altitude balloons and modelling have shown that it is in fact possible for the black carbon injected by the high-flying airplanes to react stratospheric heights. This can pose a major threat to the ozone layer,"" said Satheesh. Satheesh explained that airplanes inject black carbon directly at 10-12 kilometres height, making it possible for aerosols to reach stratospheric altitudes as there are no major removal mechanisms such as rain above 10 kms height. ""Our field experiments using research aircraft discovered the presence of black carbon aerosol layers at higher atmospheric levels over central and northern India, now popularly known as 'elevated aerosol layers',"" Satheesh said. He noted that India has committed to reduce its emissions intensity by 33 per cent of its value on 2005 by around 2030 according to the Paris agreement. ""We also committed to derive four per cent of our electricity from renewable energy sources by 2030. This requires substantial efforts to mitigate emissions of all sorts. Also, transition to renewable energy is an important step in this context and requires policy decisions, Satheesh said. ""Since emission from vehicles is another major source of black carbon, it is necessary to control the ever increasing number of registered motor vehicles in the country through policy decisions,"" he said. The theme for this year's World Environment Day is air pollution. Bhat said the open issues to be addressed include long term reliability, drift and calibration of sensors to monitor air pollution. ""It is quite likely that we will see such gas sensors integrated in our smart phones in the next five to 10 years' time frame. ""Once such sensors and the air quality data is available, a layperson can use this information to arrive at very important decisions at individual level as well as community level,"" Bhat said.

The research, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed definitive proof of decreased fetal survival rates, and also shortened gestation rates that can result in smaller body weight, in addition to the damage to brains, hearts and other organs in the adult rat models. The research team used female rats and examined the adverse health effects of exposure to fine particulate matter consisting of ammonium sulfate commonly found in many locations around the world. During winter months in India and China, where severe haze occurs frequently, fine particulate matter levels were especially high at several hundred micrograms per cubic meter, said the researchers. ""People typically believe that ammonium sulfate may not be terribly toxic, but our results show large impacts on female pregnant rats,"" said Renyi Zhang, Professor at Texas A&M University in the US. ""It is unclear yet what is causing these profound effects, but we speculate that the size of nanoparticles or even the acidity may be the culprit,"" Zhang said. ""So this certainly represents a major problem worldwide,"" Zhang added. Sulfate is mainly produced from coal burning, which is a major energy source for much of the world in both developed and developing countries. Ammonium is derived from ammonia, which is produced from agricultural, automobile and animal emissions.

David Boyd said that over six billion people, one-third of them children, are regularly inhaling air so polluted that it puts their life, health and well-being at risk. ""Yet, this pandemic receives inadequate attention as these deaths are not as dramatic as those caused by other disasters or epidemics,"" Boyd, the UN Special Rapporteur on environment and human rights, told the Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday. ""Every hour, 800 people are dying, many after years of suffering, from cancer, respiratory illnesses or heart disease directly caused by breathing polluted air,"" said Boyd, who is also an associate professor at the University of British Columbia in Canada. Boyd said that failing to ensure clean air constituted a violation of their fundamental right to a healthy environment, a right that is legally recognised by 155 countries and should be globally recognised. ""People cannot avoid inhaling whatever contaminants are present in the air inside their homes or in their communities,"" the expert was quoted as saying in a UN statement. ""Air pollutants are everywhere, largely caused by burning fossil fuels for electricity, transportation, and heating, as well as from industrial activities, poor waste management and agricultural practices,"" Boyd said. Women and children, who in many less wealthy countries spend a lot of time at home, are disproportionally affected by indoor air pollution caused by cooking, heating or lighting with solid fuels and kerosene. Boyd identified seven key steps that countries must take to ensure clean air and fulfill the right to a healthy environment. These include monitoring air quality and impacts on human health, assessing sources of air pollution; and making information publicly available, including public health advisories. ""There are many examples of good practices, such as programmes in India and Indonesia that have helped millions of poor families switch to cleaner cooking technologies and States that are successfully eliminating the use of coal-fired power plants,"" said Boyd. ""Many actions to ensure cleaner air can be designed to simultaneously reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change, resulting in a double dividend,"" David Boyd said.

India racks up health-care costs and productivity losses from pollution of as much as 8.5 percent of gross domestic product, according to the World Bank. According to the data, in 2018, with average concentrations falling by 12 percent from the previous year, China made marked progress in its usually dismal pollution levels.

Known as ‘India against pollution - no saans no vote’, the campaign is fast gaining momentum and has become popular with the support of many environment protectors. Several NGOs had previously protested the felling of trees and construction of government quarters in colonies of South Delhi, which opened the doors for the present campaign against pollution in the national capital, the report said. The main issues related to the pollution in Delhi are still not being worked upon, said a member of the campaign. The members further complained about the situations wherein Delhiites are forced to leave the national capital during foggy days as it becomes challenging for them to breathe amid such pollution levels. According to the report, they also raised questions over the government plans to tackle with the menace of pollution. Further in their complaints, the members of the campaign stated that the government is not working on the core issues that lead to pollution in the city.

The report has been released by NGO Lung Care Foundation, which analysed results of seven air quality tests taken in New Delhi and Gurugram. According to the report, the PM2.5 levels - fine particulate matters in the air with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers - in all the seven tests were above statutory limits. The PM2.5 levels ranged from 90.3 ug/m3 to 563.5 ug/m3 and were between 1.5 and 9.4 times higher than standards prescribed by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change. The levels of manganese in five of the seven tests exceed the US EPA Reference Concentration for exposure to manganese (0.05 ug/m3) and the World Health Organisation annual health-based guidelines value of 0.15 ug/m3. There are no standards in India for manganese in ambient air, the report said. ""Levels of lead in six of the seven tests exceed the US EPA 3-month average for exposure to lead (0.15 ug/m3) and in two tests exceeds the Indian NAAQS Annual and the WHO annual health-based guidelines value of 0.05 ug/m3,"" it said. Nickel levels in all the tests exceed the WHO annual health-based guidelines value of 0.0025 ug/m3, which is based on the risk of cancer associated with long-term exposure to nickel. ""Manganese, lead and nickel are neurotoxins that damage the brain. Children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of lead. Exposures to even low levels of lead early in life have been linked to effects on IQ, learning, memory and behaviour. It is a matter of very serious concern that such high levels of these toxic metals are found in the air that our children breathe,"" said Arvind Kumar of Lung Care Foundation. ""There is an urgent need for the policy makers to bring the focus back on the people and the health problems they are reporting to understand the impact of air pollution and its severity. People are the best monitors and they have been reporting severe health impacts already,"" Kumar added. The report also found high levels of barium from Diwali fireworks. ""The barium level in the air quality test a day before Diwali is 21.5 μg/m3, on the day of Diwali the test has barium level of 5.8 μg/m3, and a day after Diwali, the barium level in the test is 2.4 μg/m3,"" the report said. With the air quality deteriorating in the national capital, the CPCB has slapped Rs 1 crore fine each on three civic bodies of Delhi. According to the Central Pollution Control Board data, the overall air quality index (AQI) in the city was 443, which falls in the severe category. The CPCB has asked Reliance Industries why a fine of Rs 1 crore should not be slapped on it and prosecution not initiated over non compliance of the National Green Tribunal order on installation of anti-pollution ""vapour recovery"" systems (VRS) at fuel stations. The CPCB slapped Rs 1 crore fine each on three civic bodies of the city over open burning, dumping of waste, illegal running of plastic industries in non-conforming residential areas. In three separate notices to the East Delhi Municipal Corporation, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation and the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, the CPCB said it was observed that open dumping of garbage contributes over 13 per cent and open garbage burning over 11 per cent in the air pollution incidents in the Delhi-NCR region. Air samples taken from Delhi and Gurgaon in the last two months showed presence of alarming levels of toxic heavy metals, according to a report titled 'Death in Every Breath' released by NGO Lung Care Foundation. It analysed results of seven samples taken from New Delhi and Gurgaon. The air quality was 'severe' till Sunday but increased wind speed of 20 km/hr significantly improved it to the poor category on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the air quality again deteriorated as the wind speed dropped and was recorded in the very poor category. On Thursday, as many as 31 areas recorded 'severe' air quality and two 'very poor' air quality, the CPCB said. In the National Capital Region, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Noida and Greater Noida recorded 'severe' air quality while Gurgaon recorded 'very poor' air quality, it said. The overall PM2.5 level — fine particulate matters in the air with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers — in Delhi was 345, while the PM10 level was 513, it said. The Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting (SAFAR) said air quality index over Delhi touched the ""severe"" category. ""Both the components of particulate matters viz. PM2.5 and PM10 touched severe level. In all probability, the AQI is expected to go up further within severe range until Friday,"" the SAFAR said. Meanwhile, the CPCB also questioned Reliance Industries of why fines should fine not be slapped on it over non-compliance of the NGT order. In a letter dated January 8, the CPCB said Reliance Industries informed it that installation of VRS stage II at retail outlets selling less than 300 KL/month has been completed but no compliance status was submitted with respect to installation of VRS IB at these stations. Vapour recovery system 1B is used to control the vapour released during the offloading of fuel at distribution centres. Vapour recovery system Stage 2 is used to control the vapour while the fuel is transferred from holding tanks to vehicles. ""The above status indicates non-compliance of the NGT order and therefore, in view of above, a notice is hereby served to show cause as to why environment compensation of Rs 1 crore shall not be levied and prosecution not initiated against Reliance Industries for non-compliance of the order,"" CPCB chairperson S P S Parihar said in the notice. In three separate notices to the East Delhi Municipal Corporation, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation and the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, the CPCB said an environmental compensation of Rs 1 crore each has to be paid by the three bodies by January 31, failing which prosecution will be initiated in accordance with law. The CPCB also slapped fines on the Delhi Cantonment Board and the New Delhi Municipal Corporation of Rs 1 lakh over dumping of waste openly.

The study showed that daily fluctuations in pollution did not immediately affect the productivity of workers. However, a definite drop in output was witnessed when measured for more prolonged exposures of up to 30 days, the researchers said. In addition, working in a highly polluted setting for long periods of time could affect your mood or disposition to work. ""Our aim with this research was to broaden the understanding of air pollution in ways that have not been explored. We typically think that firms benefit from lax pollution regulations, by saving on emission control equipment and the like; here we document an adverse effect on the productivity of their work force,"" said Alberto Salvo, Associate Professor from the National University of Singapore (NUS). For the study, published in the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, the team gathered information from textile factories in China which involved interviewing managers before obtaining access to data. They compared how many pieces of fabric each worker produced each day to measures of the concentration of particulate matter that the worker was exposed to over time. ""We found that an increase in PM2.5, by 10 micrograms per cubic metre sustained over 25 days, reduces daily output by one per cent, harming firms and workers,"" said Haoming Liu, Associate Professor of the varsity. ""The effects are subtle but highly significant,"" said Liu. The researchers, however, remain agnostic about the reasons that explain why productivity goes down when pollution goes up, the study noted.

The Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting (SAFAR) said any trigger will make the air heavier, thicker and may lead to rapid deterioration in quality to severe-plus range. ""Any new trigger in terms of additional local emission, particularly from open fire, pyrotechnic display and fossil fuel burning, may make the air heavier, thicker, and with low ventilation it may lead to rapid deterioration in the quality of air to severe-plus range,"" the SAFAR said in its new year's forecast. It further said the quality of air over Delhi was in 'severe' category and forecasted it to remain in the severe zone for the next two days. ""Dense to moderate fog is likely to prevail, adversely affecting air quality. Increase in wind speed and change in direction (less moisture laden) can provide some respite, the probability of which is less,"" the SAFAR said. The last ten days of the year witnessed spells of severe pollution, episodes when air quality slipped to severe level by night and remained in the category and then slightly improved to very poor. Authorities have said that during the nights, combination of calm wind and colder conditions was elevating the pollution level. At many locations, the 24 hour rolling average (AQI) was touching severe levels for few hours. During the day wind speed was picking up slightly and temperature was increasing to keep the level at the very poor range.

All India Institute Of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Director Dr Randeep Guleria said there has been an increase in the number of patients visiting hospitals with complaints of respiratory problems and after suffering cardiac arrests during the months when pollution levels are high. Studies are being conducted to asses the impact of pollution on public health, he told reporters at the sidelines of an event at the AIIMS in New Delhi. Delhi's air quality remained in the 'severe' category for the fourth consecutive day Tuesday as meteorological conditions continued to be unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants. The city is facing its worst pollution crisis since Diwali. While the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data showed the overall air quality index (AQI) at 'severe' level of 416, the Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting (SAFAR) recorded an AQI of 423. While, the national capital has been battling air pollution for quite a few years now, air quality in Kolkata has dropped significantly over the last few months and in November it was the most polluted city in India. Guleria asked people to avoid visiting most polluted areas and taking preventive measures. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Health Minister JP Nadda Tuesday inaugurated water cooler facilities in AIIMS, donated by the Girdhari Lal Memorial Trust.

An AQI between 100 to 200 comes under the 'moderate' category, 201 and 300 is considered 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', while that between 401 and 500 is 'severe'. According to experts, under the 'severe' category, even healthy people find it hard to breathe and doctors advise physical activity to be kept at a minimum. The CPCB-led task force, during a meeting on Saturday, recommended minimising outdoor exposure for the next couple of days and avoiding use of private vehicles. On Sunday, 30 areas of the national capital recorded 'severe' air quality while it was 'very poor' in six, the CPCB said.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said prolonged period of light winds and low temperature are likely to continue for next three to five days, resulting in poor dispersion of pollutants and the air quality may continue to remain in the 'severe' category for the next two to three days. Officials said they are closely monitoring the situation and if these conditions persist for 48 hours, then stringent action would be taken. Stringent action includes emergency measures like car rationing and a ban on construction activities.

The action comes a day after the Supreme Court directed the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to initiate prosecution of government officials who have not penalised polluters despite receiving complaint against them. ""A total penalty of Rs 15.58 lakh has been imposed on violators (whose construction materials were uncovered) today. As many as water tankers have been pressed into service across the city for sprinkling water to check dust and air pollution,"" Chairman and CEO, Noida Authority, Alok Tandon said. ""I have asked authority officials for toughest action on violators of NGT orders. Officials, including junior engineers, assistant engineers and executive engineers have also been warned to ensure compliance as per court orders,"" he said. Amid severe environment concerns in the region, the CPCB had informed the Supreme Court on Monday that ""highest number"" of air pollution complaints in the Delhi-NCR pertain to construction and demolition activities, followed by burning of waste and road dust. Unpaved roads, traffic congestion and industrial emissions constitute other sources of pollution, it had said. Tandon said the authority has already implemented steps such as conducting plantation drives, creating dust free zones across the city to mitigate environment woes. ""Dust-free zones (planting grass to check soil erosion) have been created along 100 km of the city roads. Our target is to complete 375 km by March next year,"" he said.

Delhi’s air quality showed a deteriorating trend from Monday and is presently in the “very poor” category. Authorities have been mulling to use artificial rain as a solution to clear the pollution but clouds having sufficient water content that is required for inducing artificial rain are not currently available, a senior India Meteorological Department (IMD) official said. The other issue is getting clearance to fly the aircraft that will carry out cloud seeding. The scientists at IIT Kanpur have made all preparations to induce artificial rain in the national capital to mitigate the hazardous health situation caused by the pollution crisis. An IIT Kanpur professor who is working on the project said other than the availability of clouds with required water content for inducing artificial rainfall, they are also waiting for clearance from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to fly the aircraft that will be used for cloud seeding. Cloud seeding is the process of combining different kinds of chemical agents, including silver iodide, dry ice and even common salt, with existing clouds in an effort to thicken them and increase the chances of rainfall. The process also involves changing the amount and type of precipitation that falls from clouds by dispersing substances (mostly salts) into the air. The dispersion is done from an aircraft. While IIT Kanpur is supporting the plan of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to induce artificial rain by providing the salt mix and other logistical support, a group of students at IIT Delhi are also helping the weathermen in monitoring conditions to become favourable for creating the artificial rain. Delhi’s air quality has deteriorated to alarming levels in the past three weeks while the overall air quality in the national capital was in the “very poor” category on Tuesday, with some areas in the city experiencing “severe” pollution.

The team, from the University of Stirling in Scotland, analyzed the case of a woman who developed breast cancer after spending 20 years working as a border guard at the busiest commercial border crossing in North America. The woman was one of, at least, five other border guards who developed breast cancer within 30 months of each other and, at another nearby crossing, a cluster of seven other cases was noted. According to Michael Gilbertson, the findings ""infer a causal relationship"" between breast cancer and very high exposures to traffic-related air pollution containing mammary carcinogens. A link between nightshift work and cancer was also identified. ""This new research indicates the role of traffic-related air pollution in contributing to the increasing incidence of breast cancer in the general population,"" Gilbertson said. The group of women all developed a cancer believed to have been caused by exhaust fumes in what researchers have branded a 'new occupational disease'. There is a one in 10,000 chance the cases were a coincidence, the study published in the journal New Solutions said, because the cancers were all so similar and close together. A review of previous research confirmed that BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes -- which try to stop tumours growing -- can be ""silenced"" by exposures to dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons - both found in exhaust fumes. BRCA2 gets rapidly degraded in the presence of aldehydes - also components of exhaust fumes. ""There is much more research to be undertaken,"" Gilbertson said. ""But we now have plausible mechanisms for inferring how the BRCA1/2 tumour suppressors in this highly-exposed border guard became dysfunctional and likely contributed to the ongoing epidemic of sporadic, early onset, premenopausal breast cancer among her colleagues. ""With this new knowledge, industry and government can plan for new designs for industrial and commercial facilities to cut down on the occupational exposures to traffic-related air pollution,"" Gilbertson said.

Till now, we knew that the causes of diabetes are hereditary, lifestyle and diet disorders, but this study has added a new dimension. The study says, Type-2 diabetes is expected to rise by more than a fifth, from 406 million in 2018 to 511 million in 2030 globally. India, along with China and the US will share over half of these high blood sugar cases, and there will be need to improve access for the life saving insulin. By 2030, the study says, China will have 130 million and India will have 98 million Type-2 diabetics. The study says, airborne microscopic pieces of dust, smoke, liquid droplets and soot can enter the lungs and invade the bloodstream, which can contribute to stroke, kidney failure, cancer  and heart disease. Among prospective diabetics, air pollution can trigger inflammation that reduces the production of insulin. The research says, air pollution contributed to 3.2 million new diabetes cases during 2016. Already, 8.2 million lost their lives due to pollution linked diabetes, says the study. Scientists at the Washington University of Medicine, St. Louis, US, did a research for eight and a half years on war veterans, who had no family history of diabetes, and found that 2.5 PM (particulate matter) in air caused diabetes among most of them. The study showed that harmful particulate matter reached the pancreas, and disrupted the production of insulin. For India, this news is worrying. World Health Organization (WHO) has prepared a list of most polluted cities of the world, and the names of 14 Indian cities figure in that list. I asked my reporters spread in different cities to speak to doctors and experts to find out how pollution is causing diabetes, even though people follow a regulated lifestyle on medical advice. Our reporter Nirnay Kapoor spoke to doctors in Ahmedabad. Dr. Rucha Mehta, famous endocrinologist, who has worked and done research in the US, told him that pollution not only affects the lungs and heart, but it also disrupts hormone secretions in the body. Hormone imbalance causes several diseases, mainly diabetes. She said that most of the women patients were already either in the pre-diabetic or proper diabetic stage, due to pollution, but she added, the most worrying point was that children are now suffering from diabetes. Our reporters in Mumbai, Chandigarh, Lucknow, Kolkata and Jaipur also met diabetics and doctors and found the same pattern. In most of the cases, cases of diabetes have been attributed to pollution. Children suffering from diabetes are taking insulin injections on a daily basis at this young age. Two main diseases, cancer and diabetes, are spreading fast across the world. Both are silent killers and fatal. Every fifth Indian today is suffering from diabetes. A rough estimate puts the figure at nearly 25 crores. If we study the problem in depth, we can observe that overpopulation in metros and other cities is one of the major causes of pollution. This is not limited to Delhi NCR alone, other big metros are facing a similar problem. For example, the national capital has natural resources and public infrastructure to host a population of up to 50 lakhs only, but the population in Delhi now has already crossed 2.5 crore. On an average, five persons are utilizing the resources and infrastructure available for a single individual. The overcrowding of cities is due to lack of employment opportunities and better lifestyle options available in the villages. Millions of villagers have moved towards cities in search of job, food and basic civic facilities. Most of the rural areas lack proper schools, hospitals, job opportunities, and thus, the migration towards cities continues. The only way to stop migration to cities will be to improve the living conditions and job opportunities in rural areas. That is how we can address the root of the problems that relate to pollution and overcrowding of cities.

The tribunal has also asked the committee to prepare an action plan in this regard within a month. Marriage halls are violating norms by organising weddings and other functions without any permission, said a bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel. The green panel formed a joint committee with representatives of municipal corporations, the Central Ground Water Authority, the Delhi Jal Board, the Delhi Police and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee, which will be headed by the Delhi government's urban development secretary. An action plan on sewage disposal, groundwater extraction, rainwater harvesting, municipal solid waste management, systems for groundwater recharge will be in worked upon in the first meeting. It will also have to form a plan to check air quality due to traffic congestions and noise pollution because of use of DJ sets. The NGT said the action plan must involve all the stakeholders, particularly students and senior citizens. The committee will have the authority to close venues flouting norms and remove every illegal structures, it said. The committee will also look into allegations of whether members of the applicant are running swimming pools by illegally drawing groundwater without requisite valid sanctions and drawing of groundwater from critical or over-exploited areas, without any mechanism for groundwater harvesting and recharge.

People visited their kith and kin, exchanged festive greetings and sweets while social media, including the likes of WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter, was flooded with Diwali messages as many took the virtual route to convey their wishes. Meanwhile, Delhi air quality nosedived towards the ""very poor"" category on Diwali day as people violated a Supreme Court order and burst firecrackers before and after the 8 pm to 10 pm timeframe in many areas. The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 296 at 10 pm. The AQI was 281 at 7 pm. It rose to 291 at 8 pm and further deteriorated to 294 at 9 pm, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). However, the Centre-run System of Air Quality Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) recorded the overall AQI at 319, which falls in the ""very poor"" category. Watch: Delhi's air quality nosedives towards ‘very poor’ category on Diwali The Supreme Court had allowed bursting of firecrackers from 8 pm to 10 pm only on Diwali and other festivals. It had also allowed manufacture and sale of only ""green crackers"", which have a low light and sound emission and less harmful chemicals. The court had asked the police to ensure that banned firecrackers were not sold and said in case of any violation, the station house officer (SHO) of the police station concerned would be held personally liable and it would amount to committing contempt of the court. But despite the apex court order, there were reports of its violation from many areas in the national capital. Several areas showed a spike in the air pollution. Areas like Anand Vihar, ITO and Jahangirpuri recorded very high pollution levels. Violations of the Supreme Court order were reported from Mayur Vihar Extension, Lajpat Nagar, Lutyens Delhi, IP extension, Dwarka, Noida Sector 78 among other places. The police admitted that there were violations, adding that they would take serious legal action against those violating the apex court order. The online indicators of the pollution monitoring stations in the city indicated ""poor"" and ""very poor"" air quality as the volume of ultra-fine particulates PM2.5 and PM10, which enter the respiratory system and manage to reach the bloodstream, sharply rose from around 8 pm. According to the CPCB data, the 24-hour rolling average of PM2.5 and PM10 were 164 and 294 micrograms per cubic metre respectively. The SAFAR forecast ""bad"" air quality Thursday even though partially toxic crackers were burst as compared to 2017. It also said the pollution levels would peak between 11 am and 3 am Wednesday and Thursday. The situation was similar, if not worse, in the neighbouring areas of Delhi such as Gurugram, Noida and Ghaziabad, where crackers were burst as usual, raising question marks on the efficacy of the administration in enforcing the apex court's ban. A ""very poor"" AQI essentially means that people may suffer from respiratory illnesses on a prolonged exposure to such air. If the air quality dips further, the AQI will turn ""severe"", which may trouble even those with sound health conditions and seriously affect those with ailments. As many as 209 calls were received by the Delhi Fire Services on Diwali, including one related to a huge fire in a factory at Bawana, officials said. Of these, 89 calls were related to fire incidents at garbage and dumpyards, while the rest were related to fire incidents involving electric wires, at factories and residential areas, a senior Delhi Fire Services officer said. The officials said the number of calls related to firecrackers was comparatively low, but there was no decline in the number of calls related to fire incidents. The Centre, in collaboration with the Delhi government, has launched a 10-day ""Clean Air Campaign"" from November 1 to 10 to monitor and report polluting activities as well as to ensure quick action. About 52 teams deployed under the campaign are visiting different parts of Delhi and the adjacent towns of Faridabad, Gurugram, Ghaziabad and Noida. The teams are being led by the sub-divisional magistrates of the respective areas and comprise senior officials of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), representatives of the CPCB, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC). On Tuesday, the Supreme Court-empowered Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority or EPCA had banned the entry of trucks into Delhi between November 8 and November 10 amid projections of further rise in pollution level in the national capital post Diwali. The trucks carrying essential commodities, will, however be exempt from the ban, the EPCA said in the directive issued to the Chief Secretaries of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi.With PTI inputs) TOP NEWS Punjab: 'Bhagwant Mann Sarkar Tuhade Dwar' scheme benefits over 8 lakh people across state Sunny Deol's much-awaited pan-India film 'Jaat' locks its release date | Check new poster IND vs ENG: England make one change to their line-up for second T20I in Chennai LATEST NEWS ICC announces Women's ODI team of 2024, two Indians included ‘Chennai bole toh pehla chiz Mahi bhai aata hai mind mai’ - Tilak Varma ahead of India’s second T20I IND vs ENG: England make one change to their line-up for second T20I in Chennai Republic Day 2025: 5 tricolour dishes you can make at home © 2009-2025 Independent News Service.

""Despite issuing warnings every year, no strict action is being taken from the health perspective. There is awareness among people against bursting crackers, but it will still happen. So, post Diwali for 2-3 days, there is a chance of increase in patients with breathing or other problems,"" Dr Neeraj Jain of the chest medicine department at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital told IANS. What fuels a firecracker is generally charcoal. Burning this results in the release of a large amount of air pollutants, particularly sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter into the atmosphere. These get lodged in people's lungs, and there's an immediate danger for those with asthma or chemical sensitivities. ""The type of pollution that arises from crackers is different from that of particles like PM 2.5 and PM 10 in the air. However, the cracker pollution will add to the particulate matter,"" Dr Vijay Hadda, Associate Professor of Pulmonary Medicine at AIIMS, added. ""The toxic chemicals released from bursting crackers are ejected in high and dense concentration. Sudden exposure to such amount of toxic gas can be extremely harmful,"" Hadda noted. Talking about the hazards that pollution and firecrackers create, Dr Hadda pointed out that the concerns remain more or less the same, but what differs is the duration and time frame. ""The problem arising from bursting of crackers may remain on health for one or two days while that of air pollution is of long term. However, chemicals emitting out of crackers can have an immediate effect on health while in the case of pollution it has a steady impact,"" Dr Hadda said. According to the experts, people who are already facing breathing trouble like asthma or bronchitis are at a higher risk of facing danger from the combined pollution. ""It will be wrong to say that there has been a rise in new cases. Ofcourse, owing to bad air quality people did visit with health issues but few were fresh cases. Most of the patients who are already diagnosed with asthma or bronchitis or allergic to dust have been coming. Their frequency of visiting the hospitals has increased,"" Dr D.K Sharma of the Medicine department at Ram Manohar Lohia added. Apart from people with asthma or lung infections, experts noted that children and senior citizens who have higher chances for facing breathing trouble owing to pollution caused during Diwali. ""The harmful pollutants coming out from burning crackers enhance the inflammation within the respiratory system. Although the health hazards are temporary, it may turn life threatening if someone has severe asthma or other major breathing problem.

Talking about the several masks available in market which can be used as a precautionary measure to reduce the intake of harmful particles, the doctors said the N95 is of help and can be used.

On a scale of 0 to 500, the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi was recorded 403 on Tuesday at 9 a.m. On Monday, the AQI at the same time was 415. The AQI had worsened to 435 by Monday evening. The shallow fog in the morning got mixed up with the pollutants that lead to smog in the national Capital, according to the India Meteorological Department. On Tuesday, there was a slight drop in moisture, which was good for dispersion of pollutants. The pollution monitoring agencies said that the extra load of pollutants coming from stubble burning from neighbouring states also registered a slight drop, leading to slight improvement—though still in the danger zone. “The condition is expected to prevail till Diwali,” said the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). However, it might improve if no additional emission from firecrackers add to Delhi’s air, it added. The average volume of particle pollutant PM2.5 , or particles with a diametre less than 2.5 mm, was 257 microgrammes per cubic meters, considered “severe”. The safe limit of PM2.5 and PM10 is under-60 and 100 units, as per national standards. The international standards are 25 units for PM2.5 and 50 units for PM10.

Some of these tourists had to visit hospitals to seek treatment for breathlessness, allergy and irritation as the air quality turned “severe”, ahead of Diwali. On Monday, Delhi recorded its worst air quality of the season, with the pollution levels inching towards 'severe plus emergency' due to various factors including a change in wind direction and tampant stubble burning in neighbouring states. According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the PM2.5 (particles in the air with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres) and PM10 concentrations touched 365 and 503 respectively, touching the 'severe-plus emergency' category. PM2.5 levels above 300 and PM10 levels above 430 are considered ""severe-plus emergency"" category. Emily, from Amsterdam, said she was cutting short her visit to Delhi due to the deteriorating air quality. “I wanted to spend the Christmas with my friends but then the air quality is so bad that I have decided not to stay here anymore. I will rather go to Kerala and spend the rest of my holidays there,” she said. Sonia Aggarwal, who is in Delhi with her family to celebrate Diwali, said she had to take her daughter to hospital after she complained of breathlessness. “Doctors have advised my daughter to use inhalers for the time being. She took ill because of the bad weather conditions. We are concerned about her well-being,” Aggarwal, a mother of two, said. Watch: Thick haze engulfs national capital ahead of Diwali Anthony, from Cork city in Ireland, said he used to hear that winter is the best time to visit India but now he feels he should have chosen Bhutan or Nepal for vacation. Hoteliers too complained that they were suffering losses as tourists were leaving the city. “The business has started falling like every year at this time as several tourists are cancelling their stay due to the air quality deteriorating to hazardous levels. Those who were scheduled to visit Delhi have postponed their trip after reading reports of pollution; they are preferring other destinations,” said Harish Sharma, manager of a hotel in Old Delhi. In NCR, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida recorded severe pollution levels on Monday while Gurgaon recorded very poor air quality, according to Central Pollution Control Board data. The PM10 concentration in several parts of Delhi recorded ‘severe plus emergency’ levels, around 10 times the permissable limit. The overall air quality index on Monday was registered in the severe category at 434, a drastic decline from a day before when the AQI was moderate at 171. A thick haze has engulfed the national capital two days ahead of Diwali, following which, experts have warned, the air quality is likely to worsen further due to local factors.

The western disturbances, which caused the snowfall and rains accompanied, have left a positive impact over Delhi-NCR, Punjab, Haryana, Western Uttar Pradesh, with a drop in low moisture winds and temperature. This, experts believe, has provided a much-needed breather to Delhi-NCR which is seeing an improvement in air quality -- even if for a brief while. The western disturbance has however passed and hilly states will not see snowfall from Sunday onwards. ""The western disturbance is passing and the region will now see cold, but dry north-westerly winds, with a bit higher speed, which will bring down the temperatures across northern plains. Snowfall is not expected in mountain regions of Himachal and parts of Uttarakhand,"" India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientist M Mohapatra told IANS. The IMD has, however, forecast a possibility of snowfall in parts of J&K towards Sunday as well. According to weather analysts, the winds from north-west, due to their higher speed, will be good for Delhi-NCR air quality. Meanwhile, the mercury is likely to fall across Delhi-NCR region, Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh due to chilly winds from the mountains. ""The moisture in NCR is set to drop on Sunday and winds are expected to catch up. This will be good for the dispersion of the air pollution,"" said Mahesh Palwat, director private weather analyst group Skymet. On Saturday, the maximum temperature of Delhi was recorded at 30.6 degrees, while the minimum temperature was 18.5 degree Celsius. ""Sunday's minimum temperature in Delhi is likely to be around 15 to 16 degrees,"" an IMD official said. Delhi air quality on Sunday was recorded below 300, which is a vast improvement from an AQI of 370 on Friday and 340 on Saturday. However, the System of Air Quality Forecasting and Research (SAFAR)  report has attributed it to measures such as halt on all construction activities involving excavation, checking of polluting vehicles and sprinkling of water on roads imposed by authorities. The AQI has ""improved to the lower range of 'very poor' category despite adverse weather conditions, reflecting the impact of reduced base emission"", the report said. The SAFAR has predicted deterioration of air quality from Monday. The report said at this persistence stage of westerly disturbances, some instability is good for dispersion of pollutants. But, it warned that moisture in Delhi's atmosphere, fall in temperature and upper winds from stubble burning sites will ""adversely impact air quality and as per the SAFAR-forecasting model the AQI will touch upper level of very poor from November 5 afternoon onwards"".

However, the forecasts suggest that air pollution may worsen in coming days in the region. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) on Wednesday announced restrictions on construction activities, hot mix plants, coal and biomass-based industries, brick kilns and stone crushers in the NCR. The environment panel, that monitors the pollution levels in Delhi-NCR, also added that it can restrict movement of private vehicles and entry of trucks to Delhi, if needed. “The coming days could see a sharp deterioration in air quality in Delhi-NCR,” EPCA said. It also added that the coal-based Badarpur power plant was already shut and diesel generator sets were banned in Delhi since October 15. Meanwhile, cricketer Gautam Gambhir on Thursday took a jibe at Arvind Kejriwal for deteriorating air pollution in Delhi-NCR region. The Supreme Court, on the other hand, will further hear the plea on increasing air pollution in Delhi-NCR today. The apex court had asked the pollution control board and Delhi transport department to provide details of 10-year old diesel vehicles and 15-year old petrol vehicles on website. On Wednesday, despite a slight improvement due to winds, the air quality was still “severe” in many places. The air quality in Gurugram in Haryana was still in the “severe” category. Pollution levels in Delhi-National Capital Region are likely to see a spike in coming days, as farmers in neighbouring Punjab and Haryana step up stubble burning. EPCA has ordered closing down the entire industrial area of Mundka in north Delhi from November 1 to November 10 while the municipal corporation clears plastic, rubber and other wastes. EPCA has also requested people in Delhi to avoid using private vehicles between November 1 and November 10. At 4 p.m. on Wednesday, the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi was 358 or “very poor”, against 402 on Tuesday. The AQI of Gurugram was severe at 416. Meanwhile, Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh saw an improvement in AQI to 362. At Noida and Greater Noida, AQI was 347 and 383 respectively. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the “severe” levels affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases. The “very poor” levels cause respiratory illness on prolonged exposure. “There is increased burning of paddy straw in Punjab and Haryana, the direction of the wind is now from the northwest. All this, combined with Delhi-NCR’s own pollution sources, could lead to a spike in pollution in the coming 10 days,” EPCA said. On Wednesday, almost all places in the NCR saw a drop in the the major pollutants PM2.5 and PM10 -- particles in the air with diameters less than 2.5 mm and 10 mm respectively. Across 35 areas in Delhi where pollution is actively monitored, the average concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 was 221 and 408 microgrammes per cubic meters on Wednesday at 7 p.m., against 263 and 472 units on Tuesday. The same PM2.5 and PM10 concentration across 48 monitoring stations in the NCR was 209 and 386 on Wednesday, against 257 units and 457 units on Tuesday. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 units as per national standards and 25 units according to international standards. For PM10, up to 100 units is safe by national standards and 50 units by international standards. Both PM2.5 and 10 get into the lungs and cause cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, but PM2.5 is more dangerous because it mixes with the blood stream.

Across 35 active pollution monitored area in Delhi, the average concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 was 273 microgrammes per cubic meters and 487 units by 3 p.m. The same PM2.5 and PM10 concentration across 48 monitored area of National Capital Region (NCR) was 263 units and 470 units. Air quality is considered ""severe"" when either AQI is between 401 and 500 or PM2.5 is between 250 and 300 or the PM10 levels are between 430 and 500, according to CPCB. The safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 units as per national standards and 25 units according to the international standards. For PM10, up to 100 units is safe from national standards and 50 units international standards. At 3 p.m., the AQI was 425 at Gurugram, 412 in Faridabad, 410 at Sector-125 Noida, and 449 at Ghaziabad, all considered severe. At Greater Noida, AQI was 395, on the verge of being severe. The World Health organisation also came out with an analysis of 2016 data according to which over one lakh children under the age of five died after exposure to toxic air. The study noted that about 98 per cent of children in the same age group in low and middle-income countries, include nations like India, were exposed to air pollution. In the report, titled 'Air Pollution and Child Health: Prescribing Clean Air', deaths of about 600,000 children under 15 years of age in 2016 were attributed to the joint effects of ambient and household air pollution. India reported 60,987 deaths of children under the age of five due to exposure to toxic air in 2016, of which 32,889 were girls and 28,097 boys. Ban on old vehicles in Delhi In view of alarming deterioration in Delhi's air quality, the Supreme Court on Monday prohibited the plying of 15-year-old petrol and 10-year-old diesel vehicles in the national capital region. The apex court made it clear that such vehicles would be impounded if found on the roads in Delhi-NCR. Terming as ""very critical"" and ""horrible"" the prevailing pollution situation in Delhi-NCR, the apex court directed that a list of 15-year-old petrol and 10-year-old diesel vehicles be published on the website of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and transport departments of the NCR area.

Scientists at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) have developed ""environment friendly"" firecrackers which produce 30-35 per cent less particulate matter. Announcing the new invention at a press conference in New Delhi, Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan on Monday said the new crackers will not only be eco-friendly but at least 15 to 20 per cent cheaper than the conventional ones. These crackers, however, are unlikely to be produced this Diwali, he said in response to a question. They have been named as safe water releaser (SWAS), safe minimal aluminium (SAFAL) and safe thermite cracker (STAR), Vardhan said in a press conference. They have a unique property of releasing water vapour or air as dust suppressant and diluent for gaseous emissions, and they match in sound with conventional firecrackers, the minister said. SWAS crackers eliminate use of potassium nitrate (KNO3) and sulphur with a consequent reduction in particulate matter by 30-35 per cent. They match the intensity of sound of commercial crackers in the range of 105-110 decibels. STAR eliminates usage of potassium nitrate and sulphur with a consequent reduction in particulate matter by 35-40 per cent. It matches the sound intensity of commercial crackers in the range of 105-110 decibels. SAFAL has minimal usage of aluminium (only in flash powder for initiation) with a consequent significant reduction in particulate matter of 35-40 per cent compared to the commercial crackers. The minister highlighted that the Indian fireworks industry has an annual turnover of over Rs 6000 crore and provides employment opportunities to over 5 lakh families directly or indirectly. He said this endeavour of the CSIR is aimed at addressing pollution concerns and at the same time protecting the livelihoods of those involved in this trade. Vardhan said firecracker manufactures took a keen interest in the entire process with the laboratories and the new crackers would not be require changes in their manufacturing facilities. ""For the the first time in India, an emission testing facility has been established at CSIR-NEERI and extensive testing is in progress for conventional and green crackers for monitoring the emissions and sound,"" he said. This facility uses sophisticated instruments for measurement and sampling when firecrackers are used, he added. Vardhan said it was the responsibility of the firework manufactures to get a license to produce these firecrackers. Every Diwali, there is a rise in the pollution level and firecrackers are a major contributor.

The new study, titled 'Air Pollution and Child Health: Prescribing Clean Air', also noted that about 98 per cent of children in the same age group in low- and middle-income countries were exposed to air pollution. The report further says that due to the joint effects of ambient and household air pollution, in 2016, 600,000 children under 15 years of age died. The WHO study released Monday said, ""Globally, 93 per cent of the world's children under 18 years of age are exposed to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels above WHO air quality guidelines, which include the 630 million of children under 5 years of age, and 1.8 billion of children under 15 years."" Another report by Greenpeace presented a grim picture of India's pollution level. It said that three of the world's largest nitrogen oxide air pollution emission hotspots, that contribute to formation of PM2.5 and ozone, are in India with one in the Delhi-NCR. Delhi-NCR, Sonbhadra in Uttar Pradesh, Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh and Talcher-Angul in Odisha are the hotspots identified. Sonbhadra and Singrauli combined have one hotspot. The study said a total of 101,788 deaths under the age of five -- 54,893 were girls and 46,895 were boys -- were reported due to joint effects of exposure of children to ambient and household PM 2.5 and burden of disease by the country in 2016. Out of the over 1 lakh deaths in the country in 2016, 60,987 were due to ambient air pollution (32,889 were girls and 28,097 boys), it said. Industries, households, cars and trucks emit complex mixtures of air pollutants and form ambient air pollution. Due to household air pollution in 2016, about 66,890 deaths of children below five years were reported out of which 36,073 were girls and 30,817 were boys, the WHO report said. It said about 98 per cent of children under the age of five years in low- and middle-income countries, which include nations like India, were exposed to air pollution caused by finer particulate matters in 2016. Household air pollution from cooking and ambient air pollution caused more than 50 per cent of acute lower respiratory infections in children under five years of age in low- and middle-income countries, it said. Air quality in Delhi and neighbouring areas deteriorated on Sunday, with most parts recording a ""severe or severe-plus"" level of pollution while the air in Faridabad in Haryana was 21 times more polluted than safety standards. According to the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) monitoring station, the major effluent PM2.5 or particles with diameter less than 2.5mm was 1,515 microgrammes per cubic metres at 10 a.m., which dropped to 1,295 units by 3 p.m. and 1,290 units by 6 p.m. in Faridabad.

The doctors at the out-patient department of Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) are witnessing a huge number of patients with symptoms like wheezing and cough as a result of the rising pollution and a dip in the temperature, according to a report in The hindustan Times. “More than 80% of my patients were wheezing and coughing and had an increase in symptoms in the last one week. The levels are really bad and it is affecting not just the elderly and children and people with low immunity, but also healthy people. These look like pollution-related allergies and lung diseases,”  GC Khilnani,HOD, pulmonary medicine told Hinduatan Times. Doctors have reportedly enhanced the inhalers and are giving systemic asteroids, both in the form of tablets and injections, to treat these patients. Air pollutants trigger allergies, cough, lung infections, high blood pressure, asthma, anxiety, fatigue diabetes, heart disease and even irreversible lung damage. Doctors say that prolonged exposure to such high air pollutants levels leads to bad health conditions. RK Singhal, director, department of medicine, BLK Super Speciality Hospital told Hinduatan Times that apart from respiratory distress, sustained exposure to air pollutants like sulphur oxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide lowers immunity and raises the risk of viral and bacterial infections. Doctors suggest that repeated courses of antibiotics can be harmful. Symptoms such as cough, sore throat, shortness of breath and phlegm will continue for some days as it takes long to heal in this weather, the doctors at AIIMS said. Self-medication should be avoided and if the disease lasts for long, one need to see a doctor. People should also avoid stepping out during the mornings and evenings when pollutants hang in the atmosphere at a breathable level. High-risk people should avoid heavy traffic areas and crowded places. The AC fan should be kept on when indoors. N-95 masks should be used, which may initially cause breathing difficulty which eases with regular use.

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recorded the city's overall air quality index (AQI) at 252 at 11 am. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. On Sunday, the AQI had remained between 'poor' and 'very poor' categories. The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Protection Control Authority (EPCA) had last week held a meeting with officials of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi governments to discuss the pollution situation in the national capital. Here are the main causes of air pollution in Delhi 1) Motor vehicle emissions One of the main causes of poor air quality in Delhi is motor vehicle emissions. Emission by vehicles is increasing the hazardous effects of air pollution. Both, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) have declared emission by vehicles as a major contributor to national capital’s increasing air pollution. 2) Badarpur Thermal Power Station Built in 1973, it is another major source of air pollution in the national capital. As per reports, it used to produce 80 to 90% of the particulate matter. In November 2017, during the Great Smog of Delhi, the Badarpur Power Plant was temporarily shut down. However, it was later allowed to restart on 1 February 2018. From October 15, it is permanently shut. 3) Burning of woods According to the 2012 census, the national capital is kerosene free and 90% of the households use LPG for cooking. However, the remaining 10% uses cow dung, wood, crop residue and coal for cooking. This is another source of air pollution. 4) Crop burning With the states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, Delhi shares its border. Crop burning by the farmers in these states is another main reason for increasing air pollution level in Delhi. In Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, farmers burn rice stubbles. These states, approximately, set afire 35 million tonnes of crop and the wind carries all the pollutants and dust particles to Delhi. Lack of active monitoring and reaction by authorities and lack of political priority are some other reasons for air pollution in Delhi Some critical air pollutants are: (With PTI inputs) TOP NEWS Punjab: 'Bhagwant Mann Sarkar Tuhade Dwar' scheme benefits over 8 lakh people across state Sunny Deol's much-awaited pan-India film 'Jaat' locks its release date | Check new poster IND vs ENG: England make one change to their line-up for second T20I in Chennai LATEST NEWS Tamil Nadu TANCET 2025 registration begins, how to apply, fee, more ICC announces Women's ODI team of 2024, two Indians included ‘Chennai bole toh pehla chiz Mahi bhai aata hai mind mai’ - Tilak Varma ahead of India’s second T20I IND vs ENG: England make one change to their line-up for second T20I in Chennai © 2009-2025 Independent News Service.

The apex court in order said that only firecrackers having less noise and less emission will be allowed. The court made it clear that only license holders will be allowed to sale firecrackers. E-commerce companies like Flipkart will not be permitted to sale firecrackers. According to Supreme Court order, during Diwali and other festivals, firecrackers can be used only between 8-10 pm. However, on Christmas and New Year, the firecrackers can be used between 11:45 pm to 12:45 am. The apex court bench comprising Justices A K Sikri and Ashok Bhushan had reserved its verdict in this case on August 28. While hearing the plea, the apex court had said that there was a need to take into account all aspects in this case. The court pointed out that the case involved both the fundamental right of livelihood of firecracker manufacturers as well as the right to health of over 1.3 billion people in the country. The top court had said the Article 21 (right to life) of Constitution applies to both segments of people and it needs to maintain a balance while considering a countrywide ban on firecrackers. It had asked Centre to suggest measures to be taken for curbing the pollution and what will be the effect of firecrackers on the public at large. The apex court had on August 8 said a spike in PM 2.5 levels in the air is a severe problem as the particulate matter remains in people’s lungs, leading to serious health implications. Firecrackers manufacturers earlier told the court that use of firecrackers should not be completely banned and it should instead be strictly regulated. They have contended that the crackers are not the reason for increase in air pollution and there are other factors, like wind and temperature, which contribute to it.
They have said the firecracker manufacturers can be deprived of their right to do business based on statements which were not supported by facts. On October 9 last year, the top court temporarily banned the sale of firecrackers ahead of Diwali. Later, the court refused to relax its order while dismissing a plea by traders who had sought permission to sell crackers for at least a day or two before Diwali on October 19, 2017. The apex court said its ban order during Diwali that year was an experiment to examine its effect on the pollution levels in the region.

The 'Air Quality Early Warning System' is designed to predict extreme air pollution events and give alerts to take necessary steps as per Centre's Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). The air pollution system has been developed jointly by the scientists at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, India Meteorological Department and the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF). The warning system consists of a real time observations of air quality over Delhi region and details about natural aerosols like dust (from dust storms) and particulate matter using different satellite data sets, predictions of air pollutants from two different air quality prediction systems based on state-of-the-art atmospheric chemistry transport models and warning messages and alerts and bulletins. Speaking at the launch, Vardhan said the system will help in pro-actively warning 3-4 days in advance, any large-scale air pollution events which may occur over the Delhi region. Outlining a series of efforts undertaken by the central government, Vardhan said the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has constituted a 41-member team which will continuously monitor the air pollution levels in Delhi and the NCR region and will report to the board. ""Badarpur thermal power plant is being closed today, western peripheral expressway is likely to become operational in the first week of November, the Centre has released nearly Rs 600 crore to states concerned for in-situ management of crop-residue and a slew of mitigation measures have been taken by the government,"" the minister said. A new website developed for archiving all the observational and prediction products was also launched at the event. The website will be accessed by the officials of Environmental Pollution Authority (EPA) and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for taking necessary steps depending upon the requirements. The Ministry of Earth Sciences will be making further attempts to assimilate more data of other pollutants and also to improve accuracy of predictions with the technical support from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), USA and Finnish Meteorological Institute. Vardhan also released a mega emission inventory of Delhi which was made by scientists at IITM Pune who carried out a campaign involving around 140 students mapping all possible local sources of air pollution with around 37,500 hours of work.

The tenure of the last EPCA had expired on October 3. An order issued by the Environment Ministry on October 3 said, “the Central government hereby re-constitutes the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority.” The ministry said that while reconstituting the EPCA, it tried to broad-base the organisation and therefore brought in more members. Former secretary Bhure Lal continues to be the chairman, while the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) DG Sunita Narain is one of the members. The Centre had removed a JNU professor, accused of sexual harassment, from the EPCA back in July. The Environment Ministry, in an order issued on July 4, announced the removal of Atul Kumar Johri, a professor at the School of Life Sciences at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), who was arrested in March for allegedly sexually harassing several women students. The EPCA was constituted with the objective of protecting and improving the quality of the environment and preventing and controlling the environmental pollution in the National Capital Region. Several measures were enforced by the EPCA in November, which included closure of the Badarpur thermal power plant, ban on brick kilns, hot mix plants and stone crushers, and construction activities.

As per authorities, Delhi's air quality remained poor due to change in wind direction, which is now flowing from the stubble burning areas. The Centre-run System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) also advised residents in Delhi to avoid going out of home for longer durations. The overall air quality index (AQI) of 245 was recorded at 10 am Saturday which is the poor category. Ghaziabad and Gurgaon recorded 'very poor' air quality at 302 and 336 respectively, according Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. Yesterday, the AQI of Delhi was registered at 259. Earlier, it was predicted that a dust storm will hit the national capital which would further deteriorate the air quality, but, at present, there are no indications of a big storm. Authorities are closely monitoring the situation, a senior official at the Supreme Court mandated body Environment Pollution Control Authority said. The drop in the air quality is due to change in direction of wind, which is now flowing from areas in Haryana and Punjab where stubble burning is taking place, a CPCB official said. ""This is the period of monsoon withdrawals and a low pressure system in the Arabian Sea is developing. Such large scale processes tends to calm the wind speed which is usual for this time. ""This tends to increase pollution level. The impact of local transport is insignificant so far,"" Project Director SAFAR, Gufran Beig, said. An AQI between 0-50 is considered good, 51-100 satisfactory, 101-200 moderate, 201-300 poor, 301-400 very poor, and 401-500 severe. The PM10 level (presence of particles with diameter less than 10mm) was at 208 in Delhi and the PM2.5 level (presence of particles with diameter less than 2.5 mm) in the city was 104, according to a data by SAFAR.

NASA is all set to lend its helping hand to counter the air pollution menace in the upcoming winter season in the Delhi-NCR region. According to officials, the 'speciated air pollution data' from NASA's Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols (MAIA) satellite  will be used by Delhi researchers to analyse how the health impact of dust pollution differs from that of crop burning. The project is likely to be implemented by 2021, reported the The Hindustan Times. The payloads aboard the MAIA satellite will analyse electromagnetic radiations and waves to study the sizes, compositions and quantities of air particles. Delhi and its neighbouring areas are one of the 12 geographical locations for which the satellite will provide the data. Delhi is widely regarded as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Many factors such as road dust, vehicular emission and crop burning contribues to air pollution in the national capital during the winter months.

Researchers from the University of Michigan in the US, warn high risk patients who live in heavily populated areas to recognise the danger and take precautions. ""Similar to smoking, air pollution contains harmful toxins that can directly affect the kidneys,"" said lead author Jennifer Bragg-Gresham, from the varsity. ""Kidneys have a large volume of blood flowing through them, and if anything harms the circulatory system, the kidneys will be the first to sense those effects,"" she added.

The new study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, examined several prior studies on the issue. Looking at areas that are heavily polluted versus areas that are less polluted, you will find more chronic kidney diseases in the heavily polluted areas, said co-author Rajiv Saran, nephrologist at the varsity. ""In heavily polluted areas, consider wearing masks that cover your nose and mouth, limit hours outside and limit long hours commuting to work in high traffic as well,"" cautioned Saran, adding that the risk should be taken seriously.

Exposure to air pollution during pregnancy does not increase symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in the kid, finds a study. The study, led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), included data on nearly 30,000 children from seven European countries. Recent studies have concluded that prenatal exposure to air pollution could affect brain development in children, but the evidence on the effects of air pollution on ADHD symptoms is limited. The study estimated exposures to nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) throughout pregnancy at each participant's home address. ADHD symptoms were assessed using various questionnaires completed by parents and/or teachers. Joan Forns, lead author of the study, commented, ""Our findings show no association between exposure to air pollution during pregnancy and increased risk of ADHD symptoms."" Air pollution exposure during pregnancy linked to ADHD in the kid? ""Given the conclusions of this study and the inconsistent findings of previous studies, we hypothesise that exposure to air pollution might not increase the risk of ADHD in children in the general population,"" explained ISGlobal researcher Monica Guxens, who coordinated the study. ""However, we believe that exposure to air pollution could have harmful effects on neuropsychological development, especially in genetically susceptible children."" It has been shown that ADHD is the result of complex interactions between genetic background (heritability is approximately 75 percent), environmental factors and social determinants. ""We will continue to study the role of air pollution in order to rule out its association with childhood ADHD and improve our understanding of what causes this disorder,"" said Guxens.

From everyday consumer products and household habits such as paints, pet allergens to cooking gas, can be an additional source of air pollution. So, what now and how do we shield ourselves? According to Bornali Dutta, Associate Director Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, said: ""According to the World Health Organization (WHO) global air pollution database released in Geneva, India has 14 out of the 15 most polluted cities in the world in terms of PM 2.5 concentrations. It said 7 million people die every year because of outdoor and household air pollution...Reports like these suggest that the impact of pollution on human health is fatal. Air pollution has impact on most of the organs and systems of human body. The lung is one of the major sites of interaction with environmental particulates that causes and aggravates many respiratory diseases like COPD, asthma, and lung cancer. ""Air pollutants like particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and lead (Pb) can affect the lung in numerous ways like inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell cycle death. They have been shown to trigger acute episodes in asthma and COPD, other allergic airway diseases, strongly associated with lung cancer."" Arvind Chabra, Country Head, Blueair suggests some tips which will help us avoid indoor air pollution: Say no to scented incense sticks and candles: After reading this you might think twice before lighting up those decorative candles or using agarbattis. Studies suggest incense sticks and scented candles release undesired chemicals that can cause serious health problems like skin allergies and even heightens risk of respiratory cancer. Say yes to some greenery: Yes! Plants are your best friends. They provide fresh oxygen to our lungs and planting a few indoor plants in your home with help you breathe clean and off course it gives that extra punch to your indoor décor. So, go ahead, buy some beautiful indoor plants and give your house a chic look. Remove carpeting if possible: Those aesthetic carpets and rugs can actually be a source of indoor air pollution. Carpets can capture a lot of pollutants such small dust particles, food which fall on the floor, pet hair, dust mites, pesticides, cockroach allergens and other dirt. These pollutants may become airborne while vacuuming or during renovations. Children are more exposed to these pollutants are they tend to play on the carpet. Indoor smoking is deadly: Avoid smoking Indoor. It affects not only the smoker but also people around them. While we are all aware about the harmful effects of smoking, it is deadlier indoor. Since there is no space for the smoke to go out so you tend to inhale the same air repeatedly, harming your nostrils and lungs. Ensure good ventilation: Proper ventilation in your house will prevents air pollutants from affecting you and your family's health. Not only that, having a proper flow of air inside your home can help you get rid of all the unwanted smells arising from cooking or from carpets. Also, allergens such as dusts, pollen, and other irritants which tends to get trapped inside your house can be removed to a large extent if there is a proper ventilation. Give away your plastic habits: Plastics are a major cause of air pollution. The by-products of plastics called microplastics are small pieces of plastic between the size of 0.1 micron to 5mm in diameter. These microplastics are immensely harmful to our health. Shockingly microplastics have found its way to our homes also. Their contributors can be simple things like erosion of synthetic carpets, synthetic clothing or cosmetics. Hence it is advisable to use less plastics products at home and switch to a sustainable way of life. Get an air purifier: Air purifiers are the best way to clean the indoor air. In addition to investing in your health it can prevent microplastics, allergies and impure air from harming you and your dear ones.

586,IndiaTV News,https://www.indiatvnews.com/lifestyle/people-home-near-roads-cause-asthma-440330,Living near roads? Here’s why your house should be away from traffic,"Published : May 02, 2018 12:58 IST, Updated : May 02, 2018 12:58 IST","Living near roads? Here’s why your house should be away from traffic Do you know that there’s a connection between your house and the occurrence of asthma in your children? It turns out that traffic-related pollution can increase the risk of asthma in children. As per the research conducted by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, children living within a football field's length of major roadways had nearly three times the odds of pediatric asthma compared to children who lived four times farther away. While physicians have long known that smog and pollution can bring on an asthma attack among children and adults suffering from asthma, researchers have remained uncertain about what role long-term exposure to certain pollutants might play in the development of the disease in children. New research suggested that long-term exposure to traffic-related pollution significantly increases the risk of pediatric asthma, especially in early childhood. ""Our previous research demonstrated that living close to a major roadway and lifetime exposure to air pollutants were associated with lower lung function in seven- to ten-year-old children,"" said corresponding author Mary B. Rice. ""We suspected that these exposures would also be associated with pediatric asthma."" To find out, Rice and colleagues analysed data from 1,522 Boston-area children born between 1999 and 2002 whose mothers had enrolled in a long-term study called Project Viva, which was established to examine how behavioral and environmental factors - such as sleep and eating habits or exposure to pollution - impact children's health. As part of Project Viva, mothers provided comprehensive medical, socio-economic and demographic information, including residential address histories. Rice and colleagues used mapping technologies to determine the distance between each child's home address and the nearest major roadway. The researchers also linked home addresses to census data and satellite-derived atmospheric data to calculate each participant's daily exposure to fine particulate matter (PM) - tiny particles suspended in the air that when inhaled deposit in the terminal sacs of the lung. Fine PM originates from fuel combustion, including traffic, power plants, and other pollution sources. The research team also examined children's daily exposure to soot, a component of fine PM also known as black carbon. Incompletely burned fossil fuels expelled from engines (especially diesel) and power plants produce black carbon, which is a known carcinogen and potent contributor to climate change. Further analysis of the geographic data and Project Viva questionnaires revealed clear patterns. Most strikingly, living close to a major road was linked to childhood asthma at all ages examined. ""Children living less than 100 meters from a major road had nearly three times the odds of current asthma - children who either experience asthma symptoms or use asthma medications daily - by ages seven to 10, compared with children living more than 400 meters away from a major road,"" said Rice. ""Even in the Boston area, where pollution levels are relatively low and within Environmental Protection Agency standards, traffic-related pollutants appear to increase the risk of asthma in childhood"", added Rice. Lifetime exposure to black carbon and fine PM were also linked to asthma in early childhood (ages three to five years), but in mid-childhood (ages seven to 10 years), these pollutants were associated with asthma only among girls. ""Younger children spend a larger proportion of their time at home than school-aged children, and their airways are smaller and may be more likely to wheeze in response to pollution,"" said Rice. ""This may explain why pollution exposure was most consistently linked to asthma in young children. The study appears in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.

Gita Ramanan, Architect and Interior Designer, Founder, Design Cafe, and Anuj Srivastava, Co-Founder and CEO, Livspace, share some tips. Plants not only brighten up a space, but also are a source of fresh air. These Indian plants: Areca Palm, Mother-in-Law's Tongue and Money Plant (all common names) will actually grow fresh air for you indoors. No smoking should be allowed inside homes. Smoking and second hand smoke are the biggest contributors of air pollution indoors. Ensure you use low VOC (Volatile organic Compounds) paints in your home, which ensure that toxic gases and substances are not released indoors during hot/cold variations in temperature indoors. A common problem that is not addressed indoors is fixing your water leakages. Very often, we ignore water leakages into the home, which then allow the growth of fungus, mould, and mildew, which causes or worsens conditions such as asthma, wheezing, and sinus. Taking precautions such as fixing of leakages, maintenance repairs to prevent loss of heat/ cold indoors, will ensure better air quality inside. Keep a tab on your appliances. Appliances like your refrigerator and oven can emit harmful gases without regular maintenance. Make sure you take up the scheduled services and have a professional look at your devices at regular intervals. Regular dusting is important. Every home is prone to dust and dirt accumulation. While you clean your floors and upholstery regularly, you might miss out on the nooks and corners and also the roof of tall furniture sets. In this scenario, a deep cleaning can reduce the risk of dust particles that can become irritants. Open the windows. The air at home can be more harmful as it can high concentration of pollutants compared to the outdoors. Keep your windows open for 5-10 minutes daily or strategically place ventilation ducts to tackle the issue. Sunlight and ventilation can go a long way to keep you and your family healthy. Another good idea is to minimise the use of pesticides at home. Use bio-friendly products instead. Limiting the number of toxic products you introduce in to your indoor air will also make the space as less polluted as possible.

At the inauguration of a two-week ""Clean Air Campaign"" in  the national capital, Kejriwal said like the odd-even scheme, this campaign too was not a permanent solution to the problem of air pollution. ""Pollution is not a subject of the environment department, it just handles the symptoms. Until there is participation of all departments, particularly those contributing to air pollution, piecemeal efforts will take us nowhere,"" Kejriwal said. ""When we implemented the odd-even road rationing scheme, pollution levels came down. This campaign is also not a permanent measure,"" he added. Calling the campaign, a joint initiative of the BJP-led Centre and the Delhi government, an effort beyond politics, Kejriwal said the move sent a big political message. ""This campaign is an effort beyond politics and it should have happened long back for the welfare of people,"" he said, adding it must be emulated by all other departments to resolve various issues. Kejriwal pitched for a ""round-the-year study"" on pollution levels in Delhi and said pollution was dynamic in nature and reasons contributing to it changed everyday. ""A round-the-year study is the right approach to figure out modulations of pollution levels,"" he said. ""Besides, we are considering procuring international machines that accurately tells us what was causing high pollution on a particular day, be it dust or fire. If we figure out such sources, we can make priorities accordingly,"" Kejriwal said. ""We are seeking help from the Centre for all our initiatives,"" he said. Union Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan was also present on the occasion. To reduce pollution due to dust, he said, the Delhi government would create a green cover along 500 kms of PwD roads. ""We will also procure 2,000 buses and more if required to encourage public transportation. Procurement of 500 to 1,000 electric buses is also under consideration,"" he said. The campaign mandates to send 70 teams to monitor causes of pollution in the national capital and initiate remedial measures, including penal action against serious polluters on the spot. The campaign will be conducted between February 10 and 23.

""This research reveals that air pollution may have the potential ethical costs that go beyond its well-known toll on health and the environment,"" said lead author of the study, Jackson G. Lu of Columbia Business School. ""Our findings suggest that air pollution not only corrupts people's health, but can also contaminate their morality,"" Lu added. For the study, published in the journal Psychological Science, researchers examined air pollution and crime data for 9,360 US cities collected over a nine-year period. The air pollution data included information about six major pollutants, including particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide. The crime data included information about offences in seven major categories, including murder, aggravated assault and robbery. The researchers found that the cities with higher levels of air pollution also tended to have higher levels of crime. This association held even after the researchers accounted for other potential factors, including total population, number of law enforcement employees, median age, gender distribution, race distribution, poverty rate, unemployment rate, unobserved heterogeneity among cities and unobserved time-varying effects. To establish a direct, causal link between the experience of air pollution and unethical behaviour, the researchers also conducted a series of experiments. According to the researchers, previous studies have indicated that exposure to air pollution elevates individuals' feelings of anxiety. Anxiety is known to correlate with a range of unethical behaviour. The researchers hypothesized that pollution may ultimately increase criminal activity and unethical behaviour by increasing anxiety.

But there’s increasing evidence that such compounds can also harm brain development and contribute to behavioural and cognitive problems later in childhood. Babies' exposure to high levels of air pollution in the womb may lead to a type of DNA damage, typically associated with ageing, called telomere shortening, warned a study. Telomeres are the caps at the end of each strand of DNA that protect our chromosomes. Telomere shortening is the main cause of the age-related breakdown of our cells and has been linked to cancer and heart disease, cognitive decline, ageing, as well as premature death. Babies exposed to air pollution in utero, showed higher levels of PAH-DNA cord adducts -- a biomarker for exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, a toxic component of air pollution from coal plants. Elevated levels of these adducts in cord blood were associated with shorter telomeres as well as with lower levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) -- a protein involved in neuronal grown. ""An individual's telomere length at birth is known to influence their risk for disease decades later during adulthood,"" said Deliang Tang, Professor at the Columbia University in the US. For the study, which appeared in the journal Environment International, the team analysed telomere length in the umbilical cord blood of 255 newborns, born both before and after the closure of a coal-burning power plant in Tongliang, China in 2004. In May 2004, high levels of air pollution in Tongliang prompted the government to shut down the local coal-burning power plant to improve community health. ""Further follow-up is needed to assess the role telomere length plays in health outcomes in the context of early life exposure to air pollution,"" Tang said.

On Tuesday, the air quality in Delhi was ranked ""very-poor"", while it was ""severe-plus"" in Anand Vihar, Ghaziabad and Noida, even as the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) saw improvement over the last 24 hours. However, the air quality in the National Capital Region (NCR) is likely to drop to severe levels due to meteorological reasons, says the weather department forecast. ""India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted low winds, poor ventilation coefficient and stable atmospheric conditions likely to cause episodic severe air quality events particularly in the evening and night till December 29,"" a CPCB statement said. ""In view of this, concerned agencies requested to remain alert and take all necessary measures for preventing emergency situation,"" the CPCB added. The Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi was recorded 335 on Tuesday against 372 on Monday, both considered ""very-poor"".

Anand Vihar in east Delhi and Delhi Technical University in south Delhi were the most polluted regions with PM2.5 rated ""severe-plus"" measuring at 336 and 399 units, respectively. The safe limit for PM2.5 as per international standards is 25 units, while for national standards, it is 40 units. According to IMD, Tuesday witnessed the wind flow from northwest direction of Delhi which would lead to moderate or dense fog in the morning on Wednesday.

In his letter, Bhure Lal, chairman of the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, has also directed the states to intensify ground-level action to tackle the pollutant-laden haze which has shrouded the region. At around 1 pm today, the concentration of PM2.5 was 320.9 microgram per cubic metre (ug/m3), while PM10 was 496 ug/m3, four units short of the emergency limit of 500 ug/m3. Under the Centre-notified Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), pollution is considered severe plus or emergency when readings of ultrafine particulates PM2.5 or PM10 are above 300 and 500 ug/m3 respectively. Measures listed under the emergency category are rolled out when these conditions prevail for 48 hours at a stretch.  If the EPCA notifies the emergency action plan, which was done during the November smog episode, measures including a ban on entry of trucks, construction activities and the odd- even scheme may have to be enforced in the city.  In the first round, these measures were imposed on November 8 and withdrawn on November 16 after the smog lifted. The latest spell of pollution started on the night of December 19. Since then, the pollution graph has steadily risen, mainly due to a drastic fall in wind speed which is preventing dispersion of pollutants.

On Tuesday, the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi at 4 pm was 219 or ""poor"" against 361 or ""very poor"" on Monday at the same time. ""There is improvement but not enough, as rains had reduced the density of effluents however the moisture content is high,"" Shambhavi Shukla, a researcher at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) and member of the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority said. According to experts, the mixing height of pollutants have increased a bit, which will however not help with improvement of air quality due to low wind speed and moisture levels. ""This is certainly not a reason to celebrate.. the air quality is still poor,"" Shukla added. According to the forecast received by EPCA from India Meteorological Department (IMD), the scope of considerable improvement in the region's air quality are still low. On December 7, even as the drizzling was way too low compared to that between Monday and Tuesday, the AQI of the national capital improved to ""moderate"" from ""very poor"" earlier, due to the meteorological conditions. The most polluted regions across NCR, including Vasundhra in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad, Anand Vihar in east Delhi, Sector 125 in Noida and Delhi Technical University (DTU) in north Delhi saw ""very poor"" air quality despite rains, with the major pollutants PM2.5 or particles with air with diameter less than 2.5 micrometers ranging between 123 to 194.

This new study says ‘No’!,"Published : Dec 07, 2017 10:33 IST, Updated : Dec 07, 2017 10:33 IST","A recent study has claimed that even a two-hour of exposure to air pollution, especially in the form of vehicular exhaust can nullify the positive impacts of walking. It can affect the lungs and hearts of the elderly severely, researchers have warned. The findings of the study has inferred that even short-term exposure to traffic exhaust can have negative impacts on both healthy people as well as those who are suffering from lungs-relate disorders like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or coronary disease. The study comes at a time when north India is facing a serious crisis due to rising levels of pollution. ""This adds to the growing body of evidence showing the negative cardiovascular and respiratory impacts of even a short, two-hour exposure to motor traffic pollution,"" said Junfeng ""Jim"" Zhang, Professor at Duke University in North Carolina, US. On the other hand, people who walked for two hours in a large city park -- away from direct exposure to street-side traffic fumes -- reduced arterial stiffness by more than 24 per cent in healthy and COPD volunteers and more than 19 per cent in heart disease patients. However, those who got exposed to pollution experienced a maximum reduction of just 4.6 per cent in arterial stiffness, 16 per cent reduction in COPD and an 8.6 per cent reduction in heart disease. ""For many people, such as the elderly or those with chronic disease, the only exercise they very often can do is to walk,"" added Fan Chung, Professor at the Imperial College London. The study, published in The Lancet, highlights the need for stricter air quality limits and better traffic-control measures in our cities as well as greater access to urban green spaces for people to exercise, the researchers said. According to a UN Children's Fund (Unicef) report, children's exposure to air pollution can permanently damage their brains. ""Combined with evidence from other studies, our findings underscore that we can't really tolerate the levels of air pollution that we currently find on our busy streets,"" Chung said. Pregnant women who were exposed to traffic related pollutants especially PM2.5 were linked to 2-6% chances of low birth weight and 1-3% increased chances of being small for gestational age.

It’s high time to create awareness among all stakeholders to thrive towards green practices which will help reduce pollution levels. Haque told IANS in an interview on Wednesday on the release of a new global UNICEF paper. The paper claims that almost 17 million babies under the age of one lives in places where air pollution is six times higher than the safe limits. ""It is a global problem. Field burning happens in South Asia and Africa. Coal power plants are all over the world. As per the reports we have on climate change, action might be taken in a country but the reaction is (felt) in another country,"" Haque said. There is need for action by all countries so children are born and grow up in an environment that is healthy, she said. The paper -- Danger in the Air: How air pollution can affect brain development in young children -- noted that breathing in particulate air pollution can damage brain tissue and undermine cognitive development, with lifelong implications and setbacks. Even if a pregnant woman inhales toxic air, it might have an impact on her baby, she added. Haque said there was hope, citing the global momentum on climate change, but added the bigger hope comes from children themselves. ""In India, we have seen children are raising their voices, educating others. As future citizens of the country, they are raising the issues they are concerned about. That is very important,"" she said. Haque said government regulations would work but the more important aspect was involvement of all stakeholders such as agriculture groups and industries. ""There can be regulation but beyond that you need change in your behaviour. This is where industries have role to play. Cooperative groups, agriculture bodies can get farmers agreed on a code of conduct (field burning),"" she said. ""Conglomeration of various industries can come together and see how their practices can be greener. We need to invest time in educating people."" Haque also stressed that India could prompt hybrid, electric-operated vehicles especially public transport. The stern actions are required not by just the government but by all stakeholders.

A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar passed the direction while observing that the air quality in the national capital was never normal. “You all (states) tell us what steps you will take at what level of pollution. What are your normal steps to check pollution,” the bench said. During the proceeding, the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government filed an action plan to tackle the problems recommending ban on construction activities and entry of trucks and implementation of odd-even plan, among other steps. However, the bench asked the Delhi government counsel to file a detailed report, also including details of exemptions given in the vehicle-rationing plan. The NGT had on December 4 lashed out at the Delhi government for not filing a comprehensive action plan on ways to deal with severe air pollution in the city and slammed authorities for holding the India-Sri Lanka cricket match despite bad air quality. On November 28, it had asked the AAP government and four neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to submit an action plan on tackling pollution. It had earlier directed the Central Pollution Control Board, Delhi Pollution Control Committee and every state pollution control boards to file ambient air quality analysis before the tribunal on a monthly basis and also put up on their websites to enable the concerned authority to take effective steps to control air pollution.

Delhi Dynamos take on Jamshedpur FC in their second home match at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on Wednesday and a couple of players were seen wearing masks during the home side's training session. During the ongoing second cricket Test at Feroz Shah Kotla between India and Sri Lanka, the visiting players complained of breathing problems due to smog and continued to wear anti-pollution masks on the field. Dynamos coach Miguel Angel Portugal confirmed that his players wore masks but said they will not use them during the match tomorrow. ""This pollution is a problem but it's not solely for the players and me. It's for the people of Delhi. We have been training with masks, so it is fine. The players will not be donning the masks on match day tomorrow,"" Portugal said at the pre-match press conference. ""It is a home and away league and it (tomorrow) is our home match. So there is no question of not playing, we have to play here. I will have no objection if a player chooses to wear one,"" he added. Jamshedpur FC coach Steve Coppell said the football matches should not have been held in Delhi during this time of the year though he stopped short of saying that it's unsafe for players. ""Around Diwali last year I came to Delhi with the Kerala Blasters team. When we played last year, at that time the measure (level) of particulate matters was over 500. I think it's 300 today,"" Coppell, who was the head coach of runners-up side Kerala Blasters in the last edition, said. ""For the last three years I have been in Delhi at this time and there has been the exactly same commentary about doing something but nothing has happened. Last year I said that matches should not be scheduled in Delhi around this particular time of the year. Common sense should have prevailed."" Understandably, Coppell, a former Manchester United player and Manchester City coach, said he would have loved to play in better conditions. ""It's not for sportsmen to say, it is a decision the health officials will have to make. If you ask me if I want to play in these conditions I would say I don't think so."" Asked specifically if it's safe for the players, he said, ""I don't know. I would have loved to play somewhere else in better conditions. ""No, it is very difficult to play football with masks. I appreciate cricket players can play by wearing masks but it is very difficult for footballers. It shows the contrast between the two games. Football is a very intense game,"" he said. Delhi's viability as an international sports venue has been called into question after The Sri Lankan grievance came close on the heels of the furore that preceded last month's Delhi Half Marathon which took place despite high pollution levels and an appeal by the Indian Medical Association to cancel the event. The second day's play in the ongoing cricket match was halted for 26 minutes after Sri Lankans complained of breathing problems forcing Indian captain Virat Kohli to declare the innings at 536/7. The Indian team, however, has taken the conditions in its stride with pacer Mohammed Shami casually stating that they are ""used to suffering"" and did not want to make a big deal out of it.

While the observance of this day - December 5 - is inspired from the first day of the lethal smog that hit London in 1952 and which led to Britain’s Clean Air Act, UNEP said that “estimated 18,000 people die every day worldwide as a result of air pollution”. “Today is the first international #SmogDay, a moment to remember all of the people who have died prematurely, and avoidably, because of air pollution. #BeatPollution,” the US agency said in a tweet. Growing as an initiative to share the experiences of people living in London and New Delhi, the UNEP points out that each of us will breath about 250 million litres of air in lifetime “no matter where we live and how polluted the air is”. “On the worst day of the Battle of the Somme in 1916 during the First World War, 20,000 British soldiers are thought to have died. Yet, an estimated 18,000 people die every day worldwide as a result of air pollution,” said a report under a UNEP campaign—“clearing the air - a tale of two cities (Delhi and London)”. Meanwhile the air quality of Delhi and NCR deteriorated to “severe”, with major pollutant PM2.5 or particles with diameter less than 2.5 micrometeres ranging over 10 times the safe value across 21 monitoring stations in the region at 4 p.m. Of those 21 regions, five regions across Delhi-NCR saw an “emergency or severe plus” air quality, five other regions fell under “severe” category while the remaining 11 regions saw a “very poor” overall air quality. Air pollution is responsible for 6.5 million premature deaths globally every year according to the World Health Organisation. There were nearly 1.1 million early deaths in India in 2015 due to air pollution. “This is a global crisis, with 80 percent of urban dwellers breathing air that does not meet WHO health standards,” said a statement from “C40 CITIES”—an alliance of over 90 of the world’s greatest cities calling urgent action on climate change and air pollution. Six Indian cities - Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Jaipur, Kolkata and Mumbai - are members of C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan who is currently in Delhi as the Vice Chair on the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, on Tuesday announced “a new air quality partnership between London and Bengaluru”. “I’m proud today to announce London and Bengaluru will be leading a new air quality partnership. We hope to work with key cities across the world and in India, including with our good friends here in Delhi,” said Khan, who had earlier this year called for a new Clean Air Act. Aiming to control air pollution, Clean Air Act was passed in 1956 by the British parliament after its 1952 smog situation killed 9000 people. In India following the 2016 post Diwali smog situation, the Union Environment Ministry notified Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) under the Supreme Court appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority. The GRAP applies preventive measures based on the severity of air quality and the “severe and emergency” level measures were for the first time applied this November after the Delhi-NCR faced an environment emergency situation mostly due to emissions from stubble burning in the neighbouring states.

The government is trying to do its best. But to expect the government to clean up after you, I think that is not correct. So there is a lot of responsibility on ourselves (too),” Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma (retd), who is here with former US astronaut Mae Jemison and NASA’s chief climate scientist Paul Newman for a talk on the sidelines of the UN Environment Assembly on how a few humans who have left the surface of the earth have witnessed environmental changes from above, told IANS. “There is too much politics (in India) and it’s not going to help us. Realising our responsibilities is what is going to help us. “The problem with our country is we have too much politics, less democracy. It’s one thing to aspire a better life, it’s another to reach there responsibly and I do believe that we have not found that balance yet,” Sharma contended. “I don’t think we should keep blaming the government,” he said on the blanket of toxic smog over the Indian capital for weeks largely die to mass crop residue burning in the neighbouring states. Sharma was selected for a joint space programme between the Indian Space Research Organisation and the Soviet Intercosmos and flew aboard the Soyuz T-11 rocket on April 3, 1984 to dock with the Salyut 7 space station. At that time, he was a 35-year-old fighter pilot in the Indian Air Force. Also the recipient of the Ashoka Chakra, India’s highest peacetime military decoration, Sharma famously replied to then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi when she asked him how India looked from the space: “Saare jahan se achcha” (“The best in the world”). On pollution by world’s fastest growing economies India and China, he replied: “India and China are both at the threshold of reaching that point where their people are not being enabled to live that kind of lifestyles which are pragmatic with possibilities.” “There is bound to be an increase in the pollution levels from manufacturing to meet the demands of the new consumer group...So when you add the population of these two countries, we are looking at a disaster waiting to happen.” “So we really need to see that act upon, legislate and, if need be, take stringent action,” Sharma said. Favouring a commitment of not littering, he added: “It’s not that we don’t know the ramifications of our actions. We do.” The global political leadership and partnerships at all levels need to act in unison, a United Nations Environment report said on Monday, the first day of three-day third UN Environment Assembly. Over a dozen resolutions, including new approaches to tackle air pollution, the single biggest environmental killer that claims 6.5 million lives each year, are on the agenda of the assembly that is seeing a gathering of over 2,000 heads of state, ministers, business leaders, UN officials and civil society representatives to find new ways to deal with pollution. “The Executive Director’s Report: Towards a Pollution-Free Planet”, which the meeting is using as the basis for defining the problems and laying out new action areas, recommended political leadership and partnerships at all levels and action on the worst pollutants. It also favoured lifestyle changes, low-carbon tech investments and advocacy.

According to the pollution monitoring agencies, the air pollution situation is likely to worsen further over the next three days. On Thursday, the Air Quality Index (AQI) recorded by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) was 360 points in Delhi against 334 on Wednesday -- both considered ""very poor"", 453 points in Ghaziabad against 443 on Wednesday -- both considered ""severe"" and 359 (very poor) in Noida against 206 (poor) on Wednesday. Across Delhi-NCR, Anand Vihar in east Delhi, Vasundhara in Ghaziabad and Sector 125 in Noida reeled under ""severe-plus"" or ""emergency"" situation, while the air quality was ""severe"" at Mathura Road in south Delhi, Shadipur in west Delhi, R.K. Puram in south-west Delhi and Delhi Technical University (DTU) in north Delhi. The average value of major pollutant PM2.5 -- or particles in the air with diameter less than 2.5 micrometers -- was 227 units across Delhi-NCR at 7 p.m, which is nine times higher than the safe limit. However, at 10 monitoring stations of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) across Delhi-NCR, the PM2.5 oscillated between 309 and 443 units -- 12 to 17 times the safe limit. The safe limit for PM2.5 according to the international standards is 25 units per cubic meters and 60 units as per the national standards. According to SAFAR, Delhi-NCR will continue inhaling toxins, with PM2.5 concentration being almost certain to increase over the next three days. As per the satellite pictures from NASA, the stubble burning goes on even within Delhi, while it continues unabated in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The weather analysts said following an increase in wind speed in the next four days, the air pollution could see a slight improvement. ""The wind direction has changed and speed dropped on Thursday, due to which pollution levels increased. Delhi is receiving north-westerly winds that may continue for next three to four days. ""The wind speed is, however, likely to pick up in next four days due to which there is a possibility of marginal improvement in the air quality here,"" Mahesh Palwat, Director, private weather forecasting agency Skymet, said.

As stubble burning increases and spreads across districts of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, satellite images showed cases of crop-residue burning in north Delhi towards Haryana border where farming community resides. While the incidents of residue burning escaped the monitoring of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), which is responsible to check such cases within Delhi, officials say that appropriate action will be taken. ""We have not noticed any such cases and it should not be there... however we will check the incidents... If satellite images are showing this, then there is possibility of some garbage burning,"" an official of DPCC told IANS. As the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) expects the air quality to deteriorate further due to fog formation, weather analysts react predict change in the wind direction and type, from dry to moist, towards November 28 to further worsen the situation here. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Thursday, the average concentration of major pollutant PM2.5 or particles with diameter less than 2.5 micrometer at 7 p.m. in Delhi-NCR combined was 167, while in Delhi it was 172 as against a safe limit of 25 microgramme per cubic meters as per international standards and 60 units as per national standards. The average air quality recorded by 25 active monitoring stations of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and the CPCB was ""very poor"", except in Rajasthan's Alwar, where the air quality was ""moderate to poor"". Meanwhile, with PM2.5 values over 250 units, Ghaziabad, Bhiwadi and Delhi Technical University in north Delhi recorded ""severe plus"" or ""emergency"" Air Quality Index (AQI). According to the wether analyst, a western disturbance is likely around November 27 over Rajasthan and Haryana. However, this cyclonic circulation will only worsen the situation unlike the case of last week when the drizzling in Delhi-NCR due to the western disturbance bought the pollution levels down. ""The present dry and cold North-westerly winds coming from Punjab and Haryana have moderate speed today, which are suppose to change into moist south-westerly winds which will be of very low speed. Due to this the additional emissions collecting in Delhi will not dissipate while the mist and haze formation would further drop the air-quality,"" Mahesh Palawat, director of private weather forecasting agency Skymet, said.

According to the experts from Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA), the air quality may deteriorate further as fog formation is likely due to drop in temperature and lowering of wind speed towards November 23 and 24. ""Met has predicted that temperature and the wind speed will drop due to which their will be fog in the region. This may increase the air pollution, however the air quality will not reach the severe plus or emergency levels,"" Usman Naseem, researcher at the Centre for Science and Environment and member of the EPCA, said. On Wednesday, 25 active monitoring stations of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recorded ""severe plus"" or ""emergency"" Air Quality Index (AQI) at Delhi Technical University (DTU) in north Delhi, Anand Vihar in east Delhi and Ghaziabad. Punjabi Bagh in west Delhi recorded ""severe"" air quality while all remaining 21 stations recorded ""very poor"" AQI at 7 p.m. The monitoring agencies however abstained from proving the hourly index values of AQI, rather proving only concentration of the major pollutant PM2.5 and PM10, or particles with diameter less than 2.5 and 10 micrometers. At 7 p.m., the PM2.5 value at Ghaziabad was recorded at 322, at Anand Vihar, it was 341 and at DTU, it was 310 -- 12 to 13 times higher than the safe limits as per international standards. Weather analysts said that due to the low-speed northerly and northwesterly winds entering the national capital from Punjab and Haryana, the national capital and the surrounding regions are likely to inhale toxins for a few more days more. ""External emissions do have the impact on the air quality though it's difficult to access the percentage,"" A. Sudhakar, Member Secretary of the CPCB, said.

The average PM2.5 in Delhi-NCR according to SAFAR was recorded at 146 on Tuesday. As per SAFAR, all its nine active monitoring station including Dhirpur, Pitampura, Delhi University in north Delhi, Pusa and Lodhi Road in central Delhi, Mathura Road, Ayanagar in south Delhi, Noida and Gurugram had PM2.5 readings ranging between 307 to 344. Meanwhile, satellite images from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on Tuesday showed further stepping up of stubble burning in parts of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and almost all districts of Punjab. This came even as the National Green Tribunal on Wednesday ordered the Delhi government and the neighbouring states to come out with a ""definitive workable solution"" against it. The green court also ordered the Union Agriculture Ministry to hold a meeting with the states including Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajashtan on the issue on November 28.

According to SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research), an app instituted by the Ministry of Earth Science, Delhi's air quality on Saturday evening was ""very poor"" and is expected to remain ""very poor"" for next three days. Of 10 monitoring stations of SAFAR spread across Delhi-NCR, 7 recorded very poor air quality with Mathura road in south Delhi and IGI T-3 recording the worst PM2.5 concentration -- at least 320 units. Earlier in the morning, notably, most of the 17 monitoring stations of the CPCB in Delhi found air quality on Saturday in the ""poor"" bracket. In neighbouring Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurugram, the AQI also showed ""poor"" category. Experts said the rain in the national capital on Friday night and early Saturday morning was responsible for the improvement in air quality. Palawat said air quality had improved due to overnight rain, wind from the northwest and cyclonic formation in Rajasthan. ""The western disturbance has moved away from hills and hill states that have witnessed rainfall and snowfall. So winds from northwest with speed of upto 15 kmph are bringing pollution levels down. The situation will be better day-by-day,"" Palawat said in the morning. He said rains always had a washout effect on particulate matter. SAFAR records 24-hour rolling averages of PM10 and PM2.5 and uses this data to estimate the AQI. PM10 and PM2.5 are ultra-fine particles that are the dominant pollutants in Delhi. The acceptable levels of PM10 and PM 2.5 are 100µg/m3 and 60µg/m3 respectively. The larger particulate matter, measured by PM10, docked at 199 µg/m3 in the morning while PM2.5, which measures very poor and more dangerous particulate matter, hovered around 130 µg/m3. An official of the India Meteorological Department said the city recorded one mm rainfall in the 24 hours till 8.30 a.m. on Saturday. The Safdarjung observatory recorded 1 mm rainfall, Palam 0.4 mm, Lodi Road 0.2 mm, Ayanagar 0.3 mm and Ridge 0.4 mm.

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) deferred to Tuesday hearing on the Delhi government's plea on exemptions on the odd-even traffic scheme. On Friday, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) registered the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi-NCR at 299 at 7 pm as compared to 362 at 6 pm. on Thursday. Notably, seven of 17 monitoring stations of the CPCB in Delhi found air quality in those areas in the ""very poor"" bracket while remaining stations in Delhi showed air quality in ""poor"" category. In neighbouring Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurugram, AQI ranged between ""poor"" and ""very poor"". The major pollutant PM2.5 or particles with diameter less than 2.5 micro meter, recorded 299 units - putting it in ""poor"" category while PM10 concentration was found at 202 units - considered as ""poor"". Mahesh Palwat, Director of Skymet, a private weather forecast agency, said air quality had improved due to winds from north-west and cyclonic formation in Rajasthan. ""The western disturbance has moved away from hills and hill states have witnessed rainfall and snowfall. So winds from north west with speed of up to 15 kmph are bringing pollution levels down,"" Palawat said. Due to relatively cooler and drier winds, smog would not form and temperature would to go down by 2-3 degrees Celsius, he added. Palawat also said the possibility of increase in pollution due to dust storm in Saudi Arabia and UAE was ruled out as recently formed western disturbance over Pakistan would obstruct it. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), weather forecasting body under Ministry of Earth Science, has predicted levels of PM2.5 and PM10 in Delhi to remain in ""very poor"" and ""moderate"" categories, respectively, on Saturday. The NGT on Friday vacated its stay on construction activities in Delhi-NCR and ordered the concerned neighbouring states to submit an action plan to tackle the pollution menace in two weeks' time. However, it deferred the odd-even matter to Tuesday. The Supreme Court-monitored Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) on Friday wrote to the Delhi government that there was ""land available for parking of 2,000 buses within available infrastructure"" but no additional buses were procured. On Friday, Lieutenant Governor (LG) of Delhi Anil Baijal held a meeting with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot and EPCA officials to tackle the air pollution situation. In a tweet, the LG said ""Emergency measures lifted but measures like prohibition on open burning of garbage, mechanical sweeping of roads, increased frequency of metro and ban on use of generator sets to continue and to be strictly enforced by all agencies."" Later, Delhi government sent a release saying the transport department had finalised the roll-out plan for the procurement of 2,000 CNG propelled standard non-AC buses (1,000 each for DTC and Cluster scheme).

The environmental compensation of Rs 5,000 would be in addition to the fines mentioned under the Motor Vehicles Act, a bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar declared. The green panel directed shopkeepers and shoppers to park their vehicles in the multi-level parking lot, constructed by the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), which will remain open round-the-clock. The tribunal also directed the NDMC to cancel the contract of other contractors engaged in parking business in the popular market area. It directed the Delhi Traffic Police and the enforcement department of the Delhi government to be present continuously for two weeks near the multi-level parking lot and ensure compliance of its directions. ""It is conceded before us by the NDMC that the multi-level parking was constructed at high expenditure. But the parking lot has remained empty and the shopkeepers and the customers were parking their vehicles on the road causing heavy traffic congestion,"" the bench said. The contractors of the Corporation, it said, were making money at the cost of the environment and even preventing people from parking their vehicles in the multi-level parking lot. ""The huge investment by the public authorities was being wasted and serious air pollution is being caused."" The NGT directed the Corporation to consider decreasing parking fees for shopkeepers who live in the same area and directed the NDMC to notify the parking rates by Monday.

During the brief hearing, the AAP government told the bench that water was sprinkled at ITO area according to its direction and PM 2.5 levels had come down as detected by the monitoring centre of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. Some of the lawyers, appearing for builders and industries, requested the tribunal to lift its ban on the ground that air quality in the NCR had improved. The bench refused to pass any order, saying there was no urgency and no builder would be starting construction activity tonight. ""We will pass the order tomorrow (Friday) after going through the data,"" it said. On November 14, the NGT had expressed concern over the high pollution level, terming it as an ""environmental and health emergency"". The city should ""not gift infected lungs to its children"", it had observed. It had also refused to exempt women and two-wheelers from the Delhi government's odd-even vehicle rationing scheme and directed it to ensure that over 10-year-old diesel vehicles be taken off the roads without delay. It had also asked the city government to identify the most polluted areas and sprinkle water, while allowing the non-polluting industries and those manufacturing essential goods to operate in Delhi-NCR. The NGT had on November 11 stated that it would not exempt women and two-wheelers from the odd-even vehicle rationing plan to tackle pollution.

The Power Ministry today cleared a proposal to use parali with coal as fuel in thermal power stations to generate electricity. The Ministry has directed state-run NTPC Ltd to mix parali up to 10 per cent with coal to reduce stubble burning. The decision, it said, will surely help the government to tackle air pollution. NTPC will soon float a tender to buy farm stubble for power plants. “We are talking to generators of NTPC. We examined that 10 per cent of straw pellets, stubble or briquettes can be mixed with coal. NTPC is going to come out with a tender with the average price being Rs 5,500 per tonne. We are writing to states and to enforce this for all thermal plants. We are creating a market for straw and stubble,” Power Minister RK Singh said. To help the farmers deal with power plants easily, companies have been directed to set up collection centres at different locations. Delhi has been battling crippling smog and air pollution from last few weeks. Stubble burning in Haryana and Punjab was among other major reasons for pollution in entire northern India including Delhi-NCR. Earlier this week, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had met his Haryana counterpart Manohar Lal Khattar to discuss the ways to handle the situation.

The observation by a bench of justices S Ravindra Bhat and Sanjeev Sachdeva came as none of the authorities, including the city municipal bodies, were able to show they had complied with the court's urgent directions of last week to bring down the air pollution. ""Steps taken are woefully inadequate,"" the bench observed even as the municipal corporations and the Delhi government assured the court that they sprinkled water on the roads as ordered by it to reduce dust generation. The court also put tough questions to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), represented by advocate Sanjeev Ralli, on the number of prosecutions it has launched for violation of construction norms, the number of teams it has for inspection and whether any penalties was provided for under the Environment Protection Act. ""Where is the will (to take action)?"" it asked the DPCC. The pollution control committee told the bench that fines amounting to Rs 50,000 were levied for every violation of construction norms in the city and 25 per cent of the amount collected was remitted to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) for utilisation. The DPCC said the fines were levied on the directions of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) which had also ordered that remaining 75 per cent of the amounts collected be spent on mitigating air pollution in the city. The DPCC also informed the court that the quadrupling of parking fare in Delhi has been done away with. Amicus curiae and senior advocate Kailash Vasdev, assiting the court, submitted that apart from the fines, over Rs 700 crore has been collected as green cess for bringing to Delhi cars of 2000 cc or larger engine capacity. The bench, thereafter, directed the authorities, including the CPCB and DPCC, to inform it about the proposed projects on which money would be spent to mitigate air pollution in Delhi. ""We want to know what is being done with the funds,"" it said. It told the Delhi government to consider applying to the Centre under the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) Act for release of additional funds for utilisation under this law. The local bodies and the AAP government were directed by the court ""to indicate the most appropriate methods to ensure a coordinated approach to deal with polluting construction sites and effective implementation of the Air Act, the Environment Protection Act"" and the rules and guidelines framed under them. The authorities were also asked to provide the details before November 29, the next date of hearing. During the nearly two-hour long hearing, Vasdev told the bench that there has been no compliance of its November 9 order. On November 9, the high court had issued a slew of directions to improve air quality, including watering of the roads to minimise dust, and had also suggested exploring the option of 'cloud seeding"" in the meeting between the Centre and the state governments of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The Centre today placed before the court the minutes of the meeting held on November 10. Referring to the report, the amicus said that the Centre and state governments were looking at ""cost effectiveness"" of cloud seeding when the point of cost should not be a concern for them where health of the people is concerned. He also said that there was no reference in the report on how the Centre and states planned to prevent stubble burning in future. The report of the meeting also said that there is not sufficient scientific evidence to show that cloud seeding was an effective technology. Delhi government's additional standing counsel Naushad Ahmed Khan told the bench that its hospitals, dispensaries and mohalla clinics were ready deal with any health issues posed by the poor air quality. The court was hearing a PIL initiated by it to curb air pollution in the national capital. It has been issuing directions time-to-time in this regard.

Defending his government, AAP leader Saurabh Bharadwaj in a series of tweets said: ""Delhi government has never said we do not have money to tackle pollution. We have instead said we have budget to buy buses, but no space to park."" ""We have said we are even ready to pay for aerial water sprinkling, we just need support from central government and Civil Aviation Ministry,"" he wrote.

""Once you go above that, each additional 10 micrograms of pollution per cubic metre of air provided substantially higher risks,"" said lead investigator Benjamin Horne, clinical epidemiologist from the Intermountain Heart Institute in Utah, US. ""At levels higher than 25 micrograms per cubic metre of pollution, the increase in risk is linear, while below that level there's little, if any, difference in risk."" In the study, the researchers studied genetic differences between O blood types and non-O, which includes positive and negative A, B, and AB blood types. ""The one that's been found in genetic studies to be lower risk is O. The other three were higher risk,"" Horne said. However, ""this association between heart attacks and pollution in patients with non-O blood isn't something to panic over, but it is something to be aware of"", he said. Moreover, people with type O blood also have higher risk of heart attack or unstable chest pain in times of high air pollution. But their level of risk is much smaller, at 10 per cent instead of the non-O blood type's 25 per cent per 10 additional micrograms per cubic metre, Horne said. So at the 65 micrograms per cubic metre pollution level, a person with type O blood faces risk that is 40 per cent higher than if the air wasn't polluted. The results were presented at the 2017 American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in California. Staying indoors, exercising indoors, compliance with heart medication may help reduce risks, the researchers said.

In a joint statement issued here after 90-minute long between the two CMs at Khattar’s residence, it was said that they also discussed measures to ensure smog does not envelop Delhi in the winter of 2018. The meeting was primarily centred around air pollution and stubble burning that is a major contributory factor to smog, which has engulfed the national capital and parts of Haryana and Punjab over the past nearly two weeks. Environment ministers and other top officials from both states were also present at the meeting. ""We the Chief Ministers of Delhi and Haryana are happy to have had a very fruitful meeting at Chandigarh today. We recognised our deep and shared concern over the recent episode of heavy smog in our National Capital Region. We agreed upon the need for action on many measures aimed at preventing its re-occurrence in the winter of 2018,"" according to the statement. It said that during the discussions, the two sides agreed that ""serious health risks to which such episodes of smog expose one and all require concrete and quick action on a number of fronts."" ""In today's meeting we covered crop residue burning and vehicular pollution issues. We resolve to put in sustained efforts in pursuance of the jointly identified action points in the coming days, weeks and months. We look forward to covering other sources of air and water pollution in our future discussions,"" the statement added. The two Chief Ministers also briefly met the media later after their meeting. Kejriwal said that states may be separated by territorial boundaries, but nobody has control over air and joint efforts need to be put in by all stakeholders to check pollution. ""Therefore, it is very important that the country's top political executive, both of states and the Centre, everyone will have to collectively find a solution to this problem,"" he said. ""I believe today's meeting is just a beginning. It is an indication that to deal with this problem, we are ready to take whatever steps are required to be taken. We had a discussion on crop burning, on vehicular pollution, as also on bypasses which are being built, we had a discussion on how we can introduce CNG vehicles. They gave us suggestions that there are some stretches, like for example Delhi-Gurgaon has only one road stretch and if the Dwarka bypass can be expedited, likewise Badarpur-Ashram stretch...,"" Kejriwal said touching upon steps that can be taken to decongest traffic and bring down pollution levels caused by vehicles. He also said, ""I believe that message should go out that at the top level whatever steps are needed to be taken we are ready to take those steps. This is an indication to governments of both the states that strict steps should be taken to curb pollution."" Khattar said there is really genuine concern about smog, which has engulfed northern states, especially in NCR. ""It has been happening for the last two years. This problem is not related to only one state but it is a common concern. We are taking steps in our respective states whether it is stubble burning or vehicular pollution,"" he said. He said his government has decided to give subsidy to farmers and government procurement agencies on the purchase of 8-9 implements in order to tackle stubble burning problem. ""This year, the number of incidents of stubble burning has dropped in Haryana. Satellite pictures show that we have controlled it to a large extent in Haryana,"" he said. He said Delhi is the capital of India and ""we will collectively try to ensure smog does not envelop Delhi"". Kejriwal had earlier said that Khattar had invited him to Chandigarh today for the meeting as he could not meet him in Delhi because he was very busy. The Delhi CM had sought a meeting with his counterparts from Haryana and Punjab to find a solution to stubble burning in neighbouring states, a major source of high pollution levels in Delhi. The practice of burning of crop residue by farmers of Punjab and Haryana has been blamed for the toxic smog enveloping the region every winter. Kejriwal recently said the Centre, Haryana, Punjab and Delhi governments should keep political differences aside and come together to find a permanent solution to stubble burning. Yesterday, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh again ruled out a meeting with Kejriwal, asking him not to ""politicise"" the serious matter.

This is the second instance when roll out of such norms has been advanced by the government. The government’s latest decision raises concerns about ability of automakers to be ready in time with the BS-VI technologies for the national capital. Earlier in May, Automobile manufacturers had told the Supreme Court that it would be difficult to start making BS-VI compliant vehicles from 2019 to meet the April 1, 2020 deadline . The manufacturers had told the court that as per report of the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA), they have to start the conversion of their vehicles into BS-VI from 2019 so that it could be sold from April 1, 2020, but said that there were technological issues in it. In March, the apex court had banned sale and registration of vehicles which were not BS-IV compliant. According to a study, pollution caused over 9 million deaths worldwide in 2015 - accounting for 16 per cent of the deaths worldwide. The study had claimed that India had the world's highest number of deaths due to air, water and other forms of pollution in 2015. Pollution killed as many as 2.5 million people in India, highlighting that pollution disproportionately affects the poor.

The past few days have seen the AAP government in the city face stiff reprimand from the National Green Tribunal over its insistence on bringing the Odd-Even scheme while failing to take any other concrete measures to counter air pollution. A fresh revelation now claims that the Kejriwal government failed to specify its utilisation of the Rs 787 crore green cess collected during 2017. In response to an RTI reply to Sanjeev Jain, the Delhi government said that it received Rs 50 crore in 2015, Rs 387 crore in 2016 and Rs 787 crore as environment cess from January 1 to September 30 in 2017. Of this, the government has spent Rs 93 lakh of the environment cess in 2016, but there was ‘no mention of any expenditure’ in 2017. The revelation comes at a time when Delhi-NCR is facing severe air pollution level, especially smog over the past few weeks. With the crisis over toxic air garnering political undertones, the AAP government came under attack from the opposition parties following this RTI response. The Congress accused CM Kejriwal of not utilising funds for strengthening the public transport system and instead was involved in ‘blame game’. ""It is complete negligence on the part of (Chief Minister) Kejriwal's government. It has not been able to utilise Rs 787 crore which is lying idle. The public transport system in Delhi is in shambles,"" Delhi Congress Chief Ajay Maken said. Maken said that the AAP government could have bought new buses with this money and also augmented total parking capacity of the bus depots. He added that Kejriwal could have purchased road vacuum cleaners, as the dust ""is the single biggest contributory factor for air pollution"" in Delhi. ""Instead of using the money which is lying idle, he is busy aiming at the other state governments and the Centre instead of doing his bit. In Delhi, if we look at all the factors contributing to air pollution, then about 80 per cent of it is due to road dust, vehicular movement, industrial pollution and domestic pollution. And the Delhi government itself should deal with it,"" he said. ""He (Kejriwal) is passing the buck and trying to get attention. He could have utilised Rs 787 crore... they could have bought more than 1,500 Delhi Transport Corporation buses,"" Maken opined. BJP’s Delhi unit chief Manoj Tiwari said that the AAP government has failed to act on environment protection despite having ‘ample’ resources. He also demanded from the government to share details of spending of the environmental cess. “This year when the people are suffering badly and ₹775 crore lies at its disposal, the Kejriwal-led government has not found it worth spending on improving the environment,” Tiwari said. Earlier in the day, Kejriwal met Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar for nearly 90 minutes in Chandigarh to discuss steps to prevent a repeat of smog in the NCR next year. Speaking to the media after his meeting with Khattar, Kejriwal said that “ we all will have to make efforts to control air pollution"".

Over 200 workers from both the parties were gathered at the airport to protest against the Delhi Chief Minister. HERE ARE THE LIVE UPDATES: #We had a very positive discussion, we will take all steps possible to tackle the situation: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal #Joint meeting on pollution and stubble burning with Kejriwal and Khattar underway in Chandigarh #Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal meets Haryana CM ML Khattar in Chandigarh #Kejriwal flew to Chandigarh for his meeting with Khattar even as the air quality in the national capital witnessed a slight improvement. #Earlier, Kejriwal in a tweet said he along with Delhi Environment Minister Imran Hussain, Environment Department Secretary Keshav Chandra was on their way to the neighbouring state ""to discuss issues related to pollution"" with Khattar and his team. #The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief had earlier blamed stubble burning by farmers in Punjab and Haryana for the thick smog that has descended over Delhi. Besides Delhi-NCR, several cities in northern India are reeling under severe air pollution for over a week. #The Delhi Chief Minister had written to his counterparts in Punjab and Haryana requesting for a joint meeting to ""find solution"" to the problem that has led to widespread health concerns in the region. #On Tuesday, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh rejected Kejriwal's request to meet and instead asked him to refrain from ""trying to politicise a serious issue"". #Singh said that air pollution in Delhi-NCR was not an inter-state matter and needed the Centre's intervention. #Air quality in the national capital remained 'very poor' on Tuesday despite showing a marked improvement, prompting the EPCA to continue with the emergency measures such as ban on trucks and construction. #The air quality is expected to further improve today as light rains are expected, which will help in flushing suspended particulates away, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) member secretary A Sudhakar said. #According to CPCB and SAFAR scientists, the improvement has got much to do with the rise in mixing height (where air and suspended particulates mix), surface wind gaining speed, which aided rapid dispersion of pollutants, and measures implemented under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). #Union Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday said there is no need to spread panic among the people over the present air pollution situation in Delhi, adding it is not like the Bhopal gas tragedy which was an ""emergency"".

This followed Kejriwal’s request via Twitter for a meeting with Amarinder Singh in Chandigarh on Wednesday. The Delhi Chief Minister is scheduled to arrive in Chandigarh on Wednesday to meet his Haryana counterpart Manohar Lal Khattar. Responding to media reports triggered by Kejriwal’s tweet to once again seek a meeting with him, the Punjab Chief Minister said he “failed to understand why the Delhi Chief Minister was trying to force his hand, knowing well that any such discussion will be meaningless and futile”. “Kejriwal’s tendency to indulge in petty street politics is well known,” Amarinder Singh said, adding that the Aam Aadmi Party leader was “evidently trying to divert public attention from his own government’s failure to check pollution in Delhi, as exposed by National Green Tribunal response to the ill-conceived odd-even scheme”. Amarinder Singh said: “The problems faced by Delhi and Punjab on this count are completely divergent, with no meeting ground. Unlike Punjab, the Delhi problem is mainly the result of urban pollution caused by mismanaged transportation and unplanned industrial development. Instead of focusing all his attention on resolving these issues, Kejriwal wants to waste time with holding useless discussions. He said he did not have the same luxury of time (as Arvind Kejriwal). “The Delhi Chief Minister has often been accused of leaving the national capital in the midst of a crisis and travelling to other places when his presence has been needed the most back home,” Amarinder Singh said. Amarinder Singh said the Supreme Court was already seized of the pollution problem and had already made it clear that it was in favour of a comprehensive long-term solution. “That is what Punjab is also seeking. I am hopeful that the apex court will show the way to resolve the crisis, with the Centre also pitching in, as requested by Punjab,” the Punjab Chief Minister said. “As far as stubble-burning is concerned, it is not a political issue that Arvind Kejriwal is trying to project it as. It is an economic problem crying for economic solutions, which the central government alone is in a position to provide,” he said. Amarinder Singh said he would continue to pursue with the Centre the matter of compensatory allowance for farmers to enable them to opt for alternatives to the dangerous practice of stubble-burning. Most of north India, including national capital New Delhi, is witnessing smog that is causing environmental and health concerns and leading to serious accidents.

With wind speed almost doubling as compared to last week and chances of drizzle in NCR and neighbouring states, the air quality is set to improve further, falling under ""very poor"" or ""poor"" category, experts said. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) the average AQI of Delhi-NCR was 398 while the major pollutant PM2.5 or particles with diameter less than 2.5mm recorded 397 units at 6 p.m. -- considered ""very poor"". However, the average AQI of Delhi at 6 p.m. was 407 with PM2.5 at 406 units, considered ""severe"". This is considered an ""improvement"" as for past seven days since November 7, Delhi had been breathing toxic air with average AQI ranging between 460 to 500, on a scale of 0 to 500 and PM2.5 reached a dangerous 945 units at some places including Ghaziabad -- 37 times the safe limit. ""Delhi is out of emergency but not out of danger. In the coming days by November 16 and 17, the conditions are expected to get better. Unfortunately we are happy even though the air quality is very poor. In many countries there is an emergency-like condition at this air quality which we are cherishing as improvement,"" Usman Naseem, researcher at Centre for Science and Environment and member Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA), said. According to data from System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), six out of 10 monitoring stations across Delhi-NCR fell out of ""severe"" zone to ""very poor"". However, Lodhi Road in Central Delhi, Delhi University North Campus, Ayanagar in South Delhi and Pitampura in North Delhi continue to be 'severe'. The most polluted region according to CPCB in Delhi-NCR includes Ghaziabad where at 6 p.m. the AQI was 471, Anand Vihar with AQI 458, Noida sector 125 with AQI 464 -- all considered 'severe'. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), the wind speed so far towards Delhi was 5 to 7 kmph coming from eastward, however the wind speed had suddenly increased to 10 to 15 kmph from north-west which would help in dispersing the pollutants hanging in the air. ""There are fair chances of drizzling tonight or early morning on Wednesday, November 15 in parts of Haryana and Punjab. Since the winds are coming from there with good speed, the pollutant there would first settle due to rains, so the winds entering Delhi would be pure and then speed would disperse the smog here,"" Charan Singh, chief weather forecast officer at IMD, said. According to IMD, the improvement in air quality is also evident as the visibility has increased from 200 meters last week, than over 1,000 meters on Tuesday. ""The major reason for emergency situation in Delhi was stubble burning. The winds coming from Punjab were carrying pollutants and then there was moisture coming from the east. Both winds collided at low height in Delhi causing smog. We do not see improvement,"" Usman Naseem added.

The capital saw a foggy Monday morning with the minimum temperature at 12.4 degrees Celsius, a notch below the season's average. The national capital has been experiencing dense smog for the past a few days, forcing authorities to enforce emergency measures such as banning construction activities and brick kilns due to worsening air pollution. The ""odd-even"" rationing of cars, which was scheduled to begin on Monday, was however deferred by the Delhi government after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered the withdrawal of exemptions given to women and two-wheelers under the scheme. The Delhi government has said that it would appeal before the NGT on Monday seeking modification of the green court's order. Earlier today, the green court had rebuked the city government over its no-show, wondering if its statement of filing a review petition on odd-even was for media consumption alone. Responding to the NGT's observation, the AAP government said that it will file a review petition in the tribunal today and that the day wasn't over yet. ""We said we will file the plea today. Does today mean 9 am only?"" said Naginder Sharma, media advisor to the Delhi chief minister. Meanwhile, a plea was filed before the Supreme Court on Monday seeking immediate action against stubble burning and construction dust. A bench of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) bench will hear the matter at the end of the board today. Schools in Delhi reopened today after being for closed for three days due to severe smog. Schools in Gurgaon, however, will stay close even today. Heavy smog has brought down visibility in Delhi and neighbouring districts, affecting the movement of rail traffic. Eight trains have been cancelled, 22 rescheduled and 69 are running late due to the shallow fog in northern India, railway officials in Delhi said. The Rejandra Nagar Terminal-New Delhi Sampoorna Kranti Express was delayed by over 24 hours while the Sitamarhi-Anand Vihar Lichavi Express was delayed by over 25 hours. The cancelled trains include -- New Delhi-Varanasi Mahanama Express, Delhi-Azamgarh Kaifiyat Express, Anand Vihar-Mau Express, Sriganganagar-Delhi Intercity, Delhi-Fazlika Intercity, Delhi-Alipurdwar Mahananda Express and Raxual-Delhi Sadbhawana Express. According to the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), no flights were delayed or cancelled. The pollution monitoring authorities said there may be some respite from today evening from smog and pollution as surface winds will gain momentum. ""The sky will remain mainly clear during the day with moderate fog in the morning,"" the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. Humidity at 8.30 a.m. was 93 per cent and visibility was 400 metres. Light rains have been predicted in the national capital on November 14 and 15, which, the MeT officials say, could clear the smog, giving some relief to Delhiites. The MeT department has forecasted moderate fog in the morning and mostly clear sky during the day.

The organisers of Delhi Food Truck Festival (DFTF) have taken the decision to push the event to the next month, citing the obnoxious air of the city. The two-day food extravaganza was scheduled to be held on Saturday and Sunday at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium. ""Delhites, wait for a while for the fun to begin at the second edition of Delhi Food Truck Festival. We care for you.

The authority has decided to spray water over the city to settle the toxic particles of the air. Delhi has been facing severe air pollution since Monday. Illegal crop burning in the neighbouring states is being blamed to add up to the already deteriorating air quality of Delhi.

The scheme, which will run from November 13 to November 17, will see an estimated 13 lakh cars go off the roads on each of these days. The policy mandates private vehicles to ply based on the last digit on their number plates - odd-numbered cars on odd dates and even-numbered cars on even dates. This will not be Delhi’s first brush with the AAP government’s scheme – it was implemented twice in 2016, January 1-15 and April 15-30. The feedback from the people to the government’s ‘knee-jerk reaction’ were mixed when the move was implemented previously. While some saw merit it the government’s plans due to the smooth flow of traffic – half the cards were off roads – others pointed to the troubles faced in travelling through public transport. As the scheme marks its return for its third time around again for a five-day period, one must look closely to ascertain whether the odd-even scheme will help in addressing the environmental emergency that Delhi finds itself battling. Data from Delhi's past experience with the odd-even scheme suggests there is little that the move would deliver this time around too. 1. It’s about air-pollution, not traffic The entire idea of implementing this rule in Delhi again is to counter air-pollution. While the move to reduce traffic on roads will no doubt help counter pollution as well, the impact will only be minimal. Most of the reactions to the measure on social media have been limited to the impact on traffic, which is hardly any measure of change in pollution levels. On the contrary, an analysis of PM (particulate matter) 2.5 data by IndiaSpend in January this year showed that air-pollution levels in Delhi rose 15 per cent during the January 1 to 15, 2016 period of the state government’s odd-even measure over the 15 days a year ago. This has been said time and again but appears to have fallen on deaf ears. As per a study by IIT-Kanpur, four-wheeled vehicles account for no more than 10 per cent of Delhi’s overall vehicular pollution load, making the need for other drastic measures obvious. The crucial PM 2.5 levels, which the WHO considers the best measure to indicate the health risks from air pollution, fluctuated during the odd-even implementation last time around. While the first week’s average showed an increase in particulate matter, the subsequent week showed signs of improvement, but due to wind speeds increasing. This certainly dies not mean that lesser vehicles on roads translates into higher levels of air-pollution. What it does imply is that measures such as odd-even cannot suffice if we are really serious about dealing with the problem at all. Vehicular pollution does not figure in the list of top four reasons behind Delhi’s alarming levels of air pollution. As per a study done through National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) at the behest of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), road dust contributed up to 52 per cent of Delhi's PM 10 levels, industrial pollution constituted 22 per cent and open burning and other area sources contributed 18 per cent. Vehicles, as per the study, only contributed 6.6 per cent to Delhi’s PM 10 levels. The results of a different study by IIT Kanpur for PM 2.5 levels also identified road dust, at 35 per cent, as the leading contributor, though vehicles stood at second spot at 20 per cent. The findings were also submitted before the Supreme Court. Kejriwal appears to have made up his mind that his focus as far as combatting air pollution is concerned will be limited to vehicular pollution. Apparently, this measure is the easiest to implement as hard-working masses have little option to contest what the government orders. The National Green Tribunal, however, has taken strong exception to this. Besides examining the re-implementation of the odd-even scheme, the green court also rapped the city government over its failure to address other identified causes behind Delhi’s toxic air. It rapped the AAP government for failing to act against polluting industries and road dust, issues that were part of his government’s promises. Even if one were to assume that the government has identified vehicular pollution as a primary contributor and will go after it, nothing beats the list of exemptions that are part of the government’s response to what the IMA has termed a public health emergency. Not only do four-wheelers have a long list of those exempted from road restrictions, two-wheelers, that account for a majority of vehicular pollution in Delhi, have been left out altogether. As per the IIT-Kanpur study cited above, two wheelers, which are exempt from the odd-even rule, account for 33 percent of all PM10 and PM 2.5 emissions by vehicles. Trucks emit 46 percent of all PM10 and PM 2.5, among vehicles, much above the 10 per cent contribution by private cars. Click here for full coverage.

Singh said that Kejriwal is a ""peculiar person with views on everything but no understanding"". Singh said this while reacting to Kejriwal’s comments in which he blamed the neighbouring state saying the “thick, deadly smog covering the capital is mainly on account of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana”. “Kejriwal is a peculiar person who has views on everything without understanding the situation. There is 20 million ton of paddy straw, where do I ask farmers to store? So Kejriwal doesn't understand this problem,” Singh said. Singh said that he has also written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking compensation for farmers for crop residue management to check the dangerous trend of stubble burning, which has triggered a major smog crisis in the northern belt of the country. Singh also requested the Prime Minister to convene a meeting of Chief Ministers of the affected states along with the Union Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Environment on the issue. Reiterating his request, earlier raised in a letter on July 5 this year, the Chief Minister sought the Prime Minister's intervention for arresting the problem of paddy straw burning by providing a bonus of Rs 100 per quintal as incentive to compensate the farmers to manage the crop residue scientifically. He pointed out that most of north India, including Delhi-NCR, is currently in the throes of a pollution crisis, induced largely by burning of paddy straw in the paddy-growing areas of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. ""The higher courts of the country and the National Green Tribunal have also taken cognizance of the matter. However, what is probably not being understood in proper perspective is that a problem which is essentially scientific and economic cannot be tackled through other means, including coercion,"" the CM said. ""Scientific management and disposal of paddy straw entails significant cost for the farmer and he naturally prefers the cheaper and easy solution of burning the crop residue,"" he pointed out, adding that at present there are no technical or biological systems for managing this farm operation that is economically attractive to the farmer.

The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), which administers several upscale markets, including Khan Market, Sarojini Nagar Market, Central Market, however, in an order said the four-time hike, would be in place for a ""week's time"". The North and East Delhi Municipal Corporations (NDMC and EDMC) also effected the hike as per the instructions from Lt Governor Anil Baijal. ""We have increased the parking fees till further order,"" a spokesperson for the NDMC said. The NDMC runs 104 parking lots while the EDMC has over 40 under its jurisdiction. The revised rates for cars are Rs 80 per hour and Rs 400 for 24 hours, according to the SDMC order. ""For two-wheelers, it would be Rs 40 per hour and Rs 200 hours,"" it said.

""We really hope it would discourage people from using more private cars, one of the factors for environmental pollution,"" he said. The civic bodies were initially dilly-dallying in executing the EPCA's orders. However, yesterday they said they would be implementing the order, as it will discourage people from using private cars. Baijal had directed that agencies such as the municipal corporations and the Delhi Metro should strictly enforce the decisions taken by the EPCA, including hiking parking fares by four times, in the wake of severe air pollution in the city.

The party also asked why they have not framed a policy in the past six months to control it. ""The Narendra Modi-led central government and AAP government in Delhi are responsible for Delhi pollution. They cannot run away from their responsibility by blaming others,"" said Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala. ""PM Modi goes to Paris and talks about climate change but doesn't he see climate change in Delhi when the toxic smog envelopes the city,"" asked Surjewala. ""Be it Modi or Kejriwal government, they cannot run away from their responsibility,"" he said. Surjewala added: ""What steps have the central government taken to ensure the farmers around the National Capital Region (NCR) don't burn stubble. Have they been incentivised. Have special machines been provided in these regions -- which roll the stubble and dispose them."" ""Do Modi and Kejriwal government even know that if the stubble is left behind in the farmland, new crop can't be produced there,"" asked Surjewala. The Congress leader further said: ""No farmer would burn their farmlands willingly. So, the government should have come up with a policy planning, parameters to ensure that such a situation was controlled. These arrangements should have been made about six months back."" He also said the Supreme Court has taken many steps to control the pollution in Delhi. ""The UPA government was even criticised for not constructing the peripheral expressway around Delhi. But this government is there for the past 41 months. Why have they not been able to construct the 300-km peripheral expressway in this period, when they boast of constructing 52-km road each day. In 41 months, they could have constructed more than 20,000 km,"" said Surjewala. ""What steps have they taken to stop the construction work and vehicular pollution in Delhi. what is their long-term policy to ensure a pollution-free environment?"" Surjewala asked. Asked why Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh was refusing to meet Kejriwal, Surjewala said: ""There is no objection in meeting. Kejriwal is more than welcome to meet Captain Amarinder Singh or anybody else."" ""However, the responsibility has to be shared between Modi and Kejriwal. Meetings can also be photo-ops. We need to go beyond photo-ops and optics into real action to protect the environment,"" he said.

In India, the levels of PM 2.5 and PM 10, which are ultrafine particulates, remained multiple times above the permissible limits in Delhi, forcing people to breathe noxious air and triggering health complications. While in Pakistan, large swathes of Punjab remained engulfed in toxic smog. Air quality indicators show high levels of particulate matter, with breathing conditions in urban areas ranging from highly unhealthy to very hazardous. Calling smog a regional issue, Punjab province Minister for Environment Zakia Shah Nawaz Khan said that both India and Pakistan need to collaborate to find a sustainable solution to this problem. ""The only proper forum to do that at the moment is through the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). The nature of this emergency is such that let's say Pakistan effectively tackles smog and India is still struggling, we will, regardless of our efforts, still be affected by air pollution. Hence, it has to be a joint effort,"" she said in a statement here. ""Smog is pollution, plain and simple, and it is harmful to us. No one wants it to linger any longer. We have to clean our air. Now to do that, we need to have a three-pronged strategy - a long-term solution, a medium one and a short-term solution. Punjab is already implementing some urgent, short-term measures,"" Khan said. Khan said to nip this evil in the bud, ""we have to be sure of its root cause. Is the smog caused only by agricultural factors? How much do urban factories and polluting cars contribute? Even if we ban crop stubble burnings, we have to provide farmers with an alternative"". ""As for India, the federal government can initiate contact across the border. The Punjab government cannot do this on its own. Parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and upper Sindh are also being enveloped in smog so the matter is no longer limited to one provincial government. It should be on the state's agenda,"" she said.

The toxic chemicals in the air containing soot, smoke and acid severely affect your skin, snatching away the moisture, which in turn causes allergies and pigmentation. Rough skin and dryness on the cheeks are few of the symptoms of skin damage by air pollution. Not only skin, but pollution also sucks life out of your hair. It starts looking dull, lacking vitality. All those who live in an urban area need comprehensive protective beauty care, whether they stay in their houses or work outside. Cleansing of the skin assumes more importance in order to get rid of the impurities and pollutants that are deposited on the skin. If you have a dry skin, use a cleansing cream or gel. For oily skins, cleansing milk or face wash may be used. For oily skin, also use a facial scrub after cleansing. Look out for products with ingredients like sandalwood, eucalyptus, mint, neem, tulsi, aloe vera, etc., when you buy cleansers. The anti-toxic and tonic properties of such ingredients have helped in clearing the skin congestion and eruptions that result from exposure to chemical pollutants. Aloe vera, for example, is also a powerful moisturizer and an anti-oxidant. So are ingredients like apricot kernel oil, carrot seed, wheatgerm oil, etc. the skin needs to be protected. If the skin is prone to eruptive conditions like acne, pimples, rash, it should protected with specialized creams that not only protect but also reduce oiliness and deal with the problem. After cleansing, wipe the skin with a rose-based skin tonic or rose water, to complete the cleansing process and refresh the skin. Soak cotton wool in chilled rose water and tone the skin with it, patting briskly. It also improves blood circulation to the skin surface and adds a glow. Green tea also makes a good skin toner. If there is a rash or eruptions, add a little rose water to sandalwood paste and apply on the face. Wash off with plain water after 15 minutes. Anti-pollution cosmetics help to provide protection and reduce the damage caused by environmental effects. These are basically ""cover creams"" that form a barrier between the skin and pollutants. sandalwood protective cream is very useful to protect the skin from environmental effects. It forms a transparent protective cover. Sandalwood soothes the skin and protects it from irritative reactions and eruptive conditions. It suits all skin types and increases the skin's moisture retention ability too. The hair also needs frequent washing if one regularly travels long distances for their work. Pollutants also collect on the scalp. Shampoo, hair rinses, serums and conditioners help to restore the normal balances if they contain ingredients like amla, brahmi, trifala, bhringaraj and henna. They also coat the hair and form a protective cover. Mix one teaspoon each of vinegar and honey with one egg. Massage the mixture lightly into the scalp. Leave on for half an hour and then wash the hair. Rinse well with water. Or, give the hair hot oil therapy. Heat pure coconut oil and apply on the hair. Then dip a towel in hot water, squeeze out the water and wrap the hot towel around the head, like a turban. Keep it on for 5 minutes. Repeat the hot towel wrap 3 or 4 times. This helps the hair and scalp absorb the oil better. Leave oil on overnight and wash hair the next day. The impurities and pollutants can also affect the eyes, causing burning or redness. The eyes should be washed with plain water several times. Soak cotton wool pads in chilled rose water and use them over the eyes as eye pads. Lie down and relax for fifteen minutes. This really helps to remove fatigue and brightens the eyes. The views in the above article are that of international beauty expert and India's Herbal Queen Shahnaz Husain.

The argument that we have a burgeoning population does not hold water, because Beijing, teeming with population, has brought about 5 percent improvement in air pollution level in the last five years. On the other hand, air pollution level in Delhi-NCR rose by nearly 13 percent. Face-saving measures like ban on crackers on Diwali night or odd-even rules for plying of vehicles will not do. None of the state governments tried to stop burning of stubble in fields of Delhi, Haryana and Punjab. No stern measure was taken to stop pollution from nearly 20,000 factories. No water was sprinkled on 40,000 tonnes of dust that emanated from construction sites. Not a single among the one lakh-odd trucks and 89 lakh vehicles that enter the capital daily was stopped. In a belated move, the Lt. Governor of Delhi on Wednesday imposed a ban on entry of all trucks, except those carrying essential goods, into Delhi and all construction activity inside the capital. But these are not permanent solutions. It appears that the government takes decisions only when a big crisis occurs. The government only wakes up when it finds its citizens facing trouble even to breathe. The air in Delhi will not become clean through such ad hoc measures. We need to change our overall attitude.

The decision was taken at a meeting of the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Prevention and Control Authority (EPCA) here to discourage people from using private vehicles as air pollution worsened further and touched more alarming proportions on Tuesday. The National Capital Region saw its worst air quality and smog situation of the year -- which was even worse than a day after Diwali, as a yellow blanket of smog hung heavily in the sky. The pollution level rose to dangerous levels, with 18 out of 21 active pollution monitoring stations recording ""severe"" air quality.

A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar lambasted the state governments for not being prepared in advance to tackle the emergency situation. The national capital woke up this morning to ‘severe’ air quality under a blanket of thick haze, as pollution levels breached the permissible standards by multiple times. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recorded ‘severe’ air quality, meaning that the intensity of pollution was extreme. “The ambient air quality is so bad that children are not able to breath properly. Why didn’t you not spray water using helicopters as per our direction? You take instructions and inform us day after tomorrow,” the bench said. It asked the state governments to explain why they had not taken preventive and precautionary measures as it was reported earlier that such a situation was likely to arise. The green panel also directed the CPCB to state what emergency directions it has issued in excercise of its powers to tackle the situation. The tribunal was hearing a plea for immediate action against the worsening air quality in Delhi-NCR stating that it was an ‘environmental emergency’ which was affecting children and senior citizens the most. The plea said that according to CPCB report, post Diwali the ambient air quality of Delhi on October 17, 18 and 19 was found to be “very poor”. The plea also said that despite such elaborate orders from the NGT last year, the authorities have slept over it. 
 
Highlighting the increasing number of cars in the city, the plea filed by environment activist Akash Vashishta said it was “imperative that the government should take a view” with regards to putting a cap on vehicles to reduce air pollution. The plea has also sought direction to Delhi and the neighbouring states to file a status report with regard to the steps taken to educate people regarding waste burning and the pollution caused by it.

The city saw a sharp fall in air quality with places including India Gate and Rajpath enveloped in smog. According to reports, more than 20 flights have been delayed due to runway closure and smog at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport. Meanwhile, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has asked his deputy and Education Minister Manish Sisodia to consider shutting schools for a few days in view of the high pollution in the city. Declaring public health emergency in Delhi due to high pollution, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) today suggested closing down of schools and urged people not to venture out. PHOTOS | Smog envelops Delhi-NCR, air quality drops The Indian Medical Association has also written to Delhi CM Kejriwal calling for cancellation of Airtel Delhi Half Marathon on November 19 owing to 'high level of air pollution'. The rapid fall in air quality and visibility began on Monday evening itself as moisture combined with pollutants shrouded the city in a thick cover of haze. By 10 am today, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recorded 'severe' air quality, meaning the intensity of pollution was extreme. In light of the sudden dip, measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) such as a four times hike in parking fees may be rolled out by the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution Prevention and Control Authority. If the situation deteriorates further and persists for at least 48 hours, the task force under the GRAP will mull shutting schools and enforcing the odd-even car rationing scheme. The last time air had turned 'severe' was on October 20, a day after Diwali festivities, when firecrackers were set off. Since then, the pollution monitors have been recording 'very poor' air quality, which is comparatively better than 'severe' but alarming according to global standards. A 'very poor' AQI comes with the warning that people may develop respiratory illness on prolonged exposure while exposure to 'severe' air affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing respiratory or cardiovascular diseases. The CPCB has said high moisture level in the air has trapped emission from local sources and hanging low over the city in the absence of wind. ""Total calm conditions, marked by the complete absence of wind has led to the situation. The moisture has trapped emissions from ground level sources,"" Dipankar Saha, CPCB's air lab chief, said. According to private weather forecasting agency Skymet, wind from neighbouring Punjab and Haryana, where paddy stubble burning is in full swing, has started entering the city during the afternoon hours. The CPCB also recorded 'severe' air quality in the neighbouring Noida and Ghaziabad. The real-time pollution monitors displayed alarmingly high concentration of PM2.5 and PM10, which are ultrafine particulates having the ability to enter the respiratory system and subsequently the bloodstream of humans and animals, causing harm. On Monday, the MeT office predicted shallow fog in some parts of the city. ""The maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to settle around 31 and 16 degrees Celsius, respectively,"" the official had said. Humidity levels also soared high in the national capital on Monday. ""The maximum temperature was recorded at 30 degrees Celsius, a notch above normal, while the minimum settled at 16.6 degrees Celsius, two notches above normal, in the national capital,"" a MeT official had said.

According to the Central Pollution Control Board, on Sunday, the Air Quality Index (AQI) at Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad, and Noida was 439 (396 on Sat) and 423 (365 on Sat) respectively, while at Rajasthan's Bhiwadi it was 407 (369 on Sat), all considered ""severe"". Delhi's air quality was placed under ""very poor"" category with AQI recorded at 368 against 351 on Saturday. Meanwhile, at Haryana's Gurugram, AQI was 345 against 338 on Saturday and Faridabad had an AQI of 334 against 338 on Saturday. Delhi also saw, due to several meteorological reasons, a shoot in the major air pollutant PM2.5, or particles with diameter less than 2.5 mm, around the morning hours with volume ranging 12 to 19 times the permissible limits at several places. Meanwhile, the satellite images from NASA's FIRMS web Fire Mapper showed a slight hike in the stubble burning in neighbouring Punjab and Haryana, where farmers are trying to make up for the small window between summers and winters crops. As the wind direction changed on Sunday, the fine particles are being carried from Punjab and Haryana. According to the data from Delhi Pollution Control Committee, PM2.5 ranged between 317 to 492 microgramme per cubic metre at different locations between 10 am to 11.30 pm. The permissible range for PM2.5 is 60 as per national standards and 25 by the international standards. The worst PM2.5 situation was at Anand Vihar in east Delhi, ranging highest between 410 and 492 between 10 to 11.30 am. Mandir Marg in central Delhi saw PM2.5 peaking up at 339 at 10 a.m., while in Punjabi Bagh in west Delhi, it was at 372 and the level ranged between 224 to 317 from 9 am to 11.30 am at R.K Puram in south Delhi. The air quality improved slightly from 1 p.m. onwards, but PM2.5 levels was still four to seven times over the safe limit, ranging between 123 to 184 at 17 different areas across Delhi. According to the weather analysts, the sudden drop in air quality could be due to sudden change in the wind directions, as the north-westerly winds from neighbouring Punjab and Haryana started entering Delhi again, changing from earlier short-spanned south-easterly winds. ""The speed of the winds is about 10 kmph. However, this time, north-westerly winds shall be short spanned,"" Mahesh Palawat, director of private weather analyst Skymet told IANS. Sunday also saw a slight dip in the minimum temperature over past 24 hours.

According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) was at 311 on Thursday against 355 on Wednesday, both considered ""very poor"". Several places in NCR, which were earlier suffering with ""severe"" air quality on Thursday saw improvement with the CPCB recording AQI at 325 in Haryana's Gurugram (against 354 on Wednesday), 321 in UP's Noida (344 on Wednesday), 352 in Ghaziabad (402 on Wednesday) and 372 in Rajasthan's Bhiwadi (417 on Wednesday). Haryana's Faridabad, where air quality was being placed at ""severe"" or ""very poor"" since the past week, saw a considerable improvement on Thursday, with the AQI at 82 or ""satisfactory"" against ""very poor"" (347) on Wednesday and ""severe"" (410) on Tuesday. In Delhi, the major pollutant PM2.5, or particles with diameter less than 2.5mm, also saw a slight drop mostly because the wind stopped entering from Punjab where stubble burning continues unabated. The average PM2.5 value at 16 different areas of Delhi was 280, still 4.5 times more than the permissible limit. Shadipur area in central Delhi was however most polluted with AQI still ""severe"" at 436 at 5 p.m. The PM2.5 value there was around 500 till 7 a.m. while it ranged between 382 to 305 from 8 a.m. onwards till 6 p.m. Safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 (microgrammes per cubic metre) as per national standards and 25 internationally. The PM2.5 levels at eight out of ten monitoring stations of System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) were placed under ""very poor"" category, while slight improvement was seen at Pusa and Dhirpur (north Delhi). The PM2.5 value at Dhirpur, Pitampura, Delhi University (north Delhi), Pusa (central Delhi), Lodhi Road, Mathura Road, Aya Nagar (south Delhi) and Delhi Airport (T3) as well as Noida and Gurugram ranged between 260 and 322 on Thursday, against 392 and 326 on Wednesday and 362 and 302 on Tuesday. The trend in air quality improvement could however be short-lived, warn weather analysts as the wind are likely to change again Sunday onwards. According to the weather forecast, from Wednesday onwards, cold and dry north-westerly winds which were bringing toxins from neighbouring Punjab and Haryana, due to stubble burning there, to Delhi had changed into warm but moist south-easterly winds, thereby giving slight breather to the Delhi-NCR for next two to three days. ""The south-easterly winds have a speed of about 13-14 kmph which is helping with dispersal of fine particles in Delhi-NCR's air. This for next three days would provide some window to cleanup,"" Mahesh Palawat, Director, private weather forecasting agency Skymet, said.

""There is no safe time to be outdoors,"" the advisory said. According to the advisory, while the city with high volume of pollutants in the air is bad for exercising, running or participating in a marathon can add at least two tablespoonfuls of toxic ash to the lungs. Wednesday saw a further fall in Delhi's air, with Air Quality Index (AQI) ranging from 440 to 400 considered ""severe"" being recorded at different locations including RK Puram and Siri Fort in South Delhi, Delhi Technical University (DTU) in North Delhi, ITO in Central Delhi, Anand Vihar in Northeast Delhi and Punjabi Bagh in West Delhi. The data was based on the readings of monitoring stations of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). All other regions in Delhi and NCR recorded either ""severe"" or ""very poor"" air quality, with PM2.5, or particles with diameter less than 2.5mm, acting as the major pollutant. ""Running a marathon in these air conditions can deposit approximately two tablespoonfuls of toxic ash in your lungs,"" the advisory stated, adding that it was vital to plan exercise environment very carefully. The PM2.5 value of 10 monitoring stations of the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) was found ranging between 392 and 326 units against the permissible limit of 60 units as per national standards and 25 units as per international standards. ""The current level of air pollution in Delhi affects even the unborn child in mother's womb,"" advisory added. The advisory points out that while a normal adult breathes approximately six litres of air per minute at rest, during exercising it increases to 20 liters. With current air-pollution in Delhi and NCR, this increases toxins in lungs. ""Exercising is vital for health but not when we are breathing poison."" The advisory endorsed by seven medical practitioners, including those from the Department of Respiratory Medicine and Chest Surgery of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital states that even N-95 standard masks, which stops fine particles, ""could be suffocating while exercising"". ""Exercise areas should be at least 200 meters away from roads, construction sites and smoke-emitting industry,"" advisory says, adding that ""even this does not guarantee clean air"".

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recorded an air quality of index (AQI) of 'very poor' with a score of 319 for the city. Neighbouring Gurgaon was a shade better with 'poor' AQI, while Noida and Ghaziabad were 'very poor'. Dipankar Saha, the CPCB's air lab head, said wind speed went up to 12 km per hour at certain points, leading to the dispersal of suspended particulate matter, which was aided by the creation of an air passage from the west to east. ""The weakening of a depression, which had formed over the Bay of Bengal, and its gradual shift towards Assam has helped create the passage. This coupled with strong winds have cleaned the air considerably,"" Saha told PTI. Post Diwali, on October 20, Delhi's air had turned 'severe' for the first time in 2017. Since then, it has markedly improved. He said the situation was likely to further improve tomorrow. The forecast of System of Air Quality Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) held out hope as well. According to SAFAR's forecast, the 24-hour-average levels of coarse particulate PM10, which measure around 10 microns in diameter, will come down to the moderate level tomorrow. It recorded PM2.5 and PM10 at 151 and 256 micrograms per cubic metre today (24-hour rolling average). The corresponding prescribed standards are 60 and 100. The air quality index or AQI is basically a figure and a series of colour codings shared by agencies on the level of pollution. For example, the one CPCB shares ranges between 0 and 500. An AQI between 0-50 is considered Good, 51-100 Satisfactory, 101-200 Moderate, 201-300 Poor, 301-400 Very Poor, and 401-500 Severe.

Data released by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) showed that air quality in the national capital remained ""very poor"", two days after Diwali. According to the CPCB, the Air Quality Index (AQI) touched the figure of 389 on Saturday, which comes under the ""very poor"" category. The air quality index for Delhi was same on November 1, 2016 -- two days after Diwali. According to Mahesh Palawat, Director of private weather forecaster Skymet, it is due to calmness in wind speed as compared to last year. ""Last year, wind blowing at a higher speed played a crucial role in improving air quality after Diwali. But this year, wind is blowing at a speed less than 10 km per hour and therefore is not able to suspend particulate matters' spread around us,"" Palawat said. However, he predicted that things would improve in the coming days as there were chances of rise in wind speed. ""Coincidentally, the air quality index two days after Diwali remains the same as last year,"" Vivek Chattopadhyaya, air quality expert at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), told IANS, adding that weather also played a crucial role in air quality. However, he pointed out that an increase in number of monitoring stations over the last one year might also have contributed to recording higher level of pollution. However, he said compared to last year, there was slight improvement in the visibility and air quality index post Diwali and for this, ""credit goes to the Supreme Court which has banned the sale of firecrackers"". ""There were six monitoring stations in 2016, while this year it is 16,"" he said. He cited October 21, 2016's air quality index which was 264, falling under ""poor category"". High humidity, low wind speed and low temperatures meant the pollutants hovered very close to the surface and could not be dispersed, he added. The Supreme Court ban on sale of firecrackers did not prevent people from lighting sparklers, rockets and loud Diwali ""bombs"" though the volume was lower than previous years. Some people claimed to have travelled out of the city or shopped online to buy firecrackers, while many claimed they used last year's leftover stock to celebrate Diwali. The court on October 9 affirmed the ban it had imposed on the sale of firecrackers in Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR). The court said the ban would be in effect till November 1. Expressing concern over poor implementation of the Supreme Court ban on the sale of fire crackers in Delhi-NCR, industry chamber Assocham on Saturday said ensuring a clean environment should be a combined responsibility of the Centre, the state governments, civil society and public at large and not of the apex court alone. ""The economic interest of the traders and the manufacturers was involved; but once the Supreme Court had banned sale of firecrackers, the enforcement of the order should have been ensured by the Union Environment Ministry, Delhi government and the state governments of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana in entire NCR,"" said D.S.

This despite a full ban on sale of firecrackers in the entire National Capital Region by the Supreme Court, which is being enforced till October 31. Firecrackers were burst on a large scale on Diwali night, but it would be difficult to make comparisons of air pollution with last year's figures. The amount of harmful particulates in air depends on the weather of that particular day. Last year, when Diwali was celebrated, winter had almost set in, whereas this was not the case this year. Normally smogs do not occur if the temperature is on the higher side. Moreover, the pollution level was lower this year because of harvesting is yet to be over in neighbouring states, whereas last year harvesting was over and farmers were openly burning stubble in the fields. This year there is widespread awareness against burning of stubble. One major contribution to air pollution in Delhi comes from emission of carcinogenic gases from diesel vehicles. The National Green Tribunal, in November 2014, had ordered ban on plying of all 10-year-old diesel vehicles in the NCR, and last month, it dismissed the Centre's plea for modification to this order. According to experts, one old diesel vehicle causes pollution equivalent to 24 petrol vehicles or 36 CNG vehicles.There are more than seven lakh diesel vehicles in Delhi. Firecrackers are burst only on Diwali night in the capital, whereas diesel vehicles run daily, contributing massively to air pollution. Therefore, to assume that air pollution in Delhi-NCR this year post-Diwali was less would be incorrect, because there has been no major curb on plying of diesel vehicles so far.

Some people have however, claimed to have found a different way to get firecrackers. But there are many who got the message to celebrate the festival without adding to the already deteriorating air quality in the national capital. Many firecracker lovers spoke to IANS that they managed to get firecrackers online or have brought them from places close to Delhi. Despite reports about an upswing in the black market of crackers, one of the traders approached by an IANS correspondent simply refused to deliver any products but said people were welcome to come and buy on November 1 -- by when the Supreme Court ban will be over. Amit, 42, from Ajit Fireworks near Jama Masjid, said he was getting calls from a lot of people, especially kids, requesting for some crackers, but they were simply told - ""No, you will have to wait till the end of this month."" ""It is certainly difficult to explain it to the kids. I am trying to convince them like their parents must be doing,"" he said. Others in the market, he said, had switched off their phones to avoid calls from buyers. Amit said his own children and family were using some of the previous stock he had accumulated for Diwali sale. ""Our kids will be bursting some. We are distributing the rest among our relatives."" Last year on Diwali, PM2.5 levels in some areas of Delhi increased to 1,238. The World Health Organization recommends that PM2.5 is kept below 10 as an annual average, as exposure to average annual concentrations of PM2.5 of 35 or above is associated with a 15 per cent higher long-term mortality risk. Delhi and NCR are one of the worst polluted regions in the world, with an annual average PM2.5 measurement of 122. On Tuesday, average air-quality index reading for Delhi was said to be ""very poor"" and ""severe"", amid apprehensions that firecrackers on Diwali would further worsen the air quality. ""We have made arrangements in our society and somehow made it available to everybody in our area,"" said Pramod Shah, 51, an east Delhi resident. Anmol Agrawal, 22, a Saket resident, said: ""Those who are desperate to burst crackers and cause pollution must be making arrangements from somewhere or the other. If not from Delhi, they can certainly source them from nearby cities in other places beyond NCR. ""I support a pollution free Diwali...won't be sourcing crackers from anywhere,"" she said. Vikrant Tongad, an environmentalist with Social Action for Forest and Environment (SAFE) NGO, said the Supreme Court order would ""surely"" help in preventing further deterioration of air quality in Delhi and NCR. But expecting a noise-free Diwali was asking for too much. ""The Supreme Court ban will help. Crackers are not easily accessible. It is good. But the problem is larger. It will be less toxic and less noisy but not a completely a cracker-free Diwali,"" Tongad said.

Delhi Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (DTIDC), which maintains inter-state bus terminals in the city, has issued an order enforcing the fines at all the three ISBTs in the national capital -- Kashmeri Gate, Anand Vihar and Sarai Kale Khan. Roadways buses of several states -- Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu Kashmir and Rajasthan -- operate from all three ISBTs. According to the DTIDC, it has been observed that noise pollution at ISBTs has reached an alarming level and immediate steps were required to combat this problem. The DTIDC stated it had been observed that frequent usage of horn and soliciting of passengers by roadways staff with loud noise were the major sources of noise pollution at ISBTs. Meanwhile, steps are also been taken to bring down the alarming levels of air pollution. The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Prevention and Control Authority (EPAC) has proposed a slew of measures that will be implemented in national capital if pollution levels show any rapid spike. The EPAC, a body empowered to enforce the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), has proposed hiking parking fee and is also implementing the odd-even formula to keep vehicles away from roads. On the other hand, strict measures under the GRAPs including shutting the Badarpur power plant and hundreds of brick kilns, banning use of diesel generators among others steps came into effect on Tuesday. The EPAC has also made it clear that parking fees would be increased four times the current amount if the air quality worsens and it will not hesitate to enforce the odd-even plan, order cars off roads, and shut schools. The EPCA said that two other thermal power plants in the region, at Dadri and Jhajjar, will also have to be shut if pollution reaches emergency levels and also directed that Bawana gas-based plant be run at full capacity. The measures under the GRAPs are expected to remain in force till March 15. Under the GRAP, strict measures under very poor and severe categories are rolled out when levels of PM2.5 are between 121-250 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) and above 250 µg/m3 respectively. PM10 levels have to be between 351-430 µg/m3 PM10 levels add above 430 µg/m3 respectively. The 24-hour-average safe standards of PM2.5 and PM10 are 60 and 100 respectively and anything beyond that can harm living beings as these pollutants measure up to 30 times tinier than the width of a human hair. The severe plus or the emergency action plan under GRAP, which proposes a ban on construction activities, odd-even scheme, ban on entry of trucks and closure of schools, shall come into force when PM2.5 levels cross 300 µg/m3 or PM10 levels cross 500 µg/m3 (five times above the standard level) and persist for 48 hours or more. Experts say that Delhi's air quality is likely to worsen and turn 'severe' after Diwali, mainly due to meteorological conditions that will trap pollutants from local sources such as firecrackers. This time, the atmospheric conditions are such that the post-Diwali air quality is entirely tied to the level of firecrackers the city witnesses on the night of the festivities. With an air quality index (AQI) of 306, the city's air quality was recorded as 'very poor' by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Tuesday and the possibility of it turning 'severe' is looming large. However, in Rajasthan's Bhiwadi, which is an industrial hub barely 80 kilometres from Delhi and part of the National Capital Region, AQI was severe, the worst in the entire country. Last year, the air quality of Delhi had plunged and a dense blanket of smog had kept the city shrouded for over a week in November, soon after the Diwali festivities, prompting the authorities to announce closure of schools among other emergency measures.

The move came in line with the Supreme Court order, banning the sale and purchase of firecrackers in Delhi due to pollution concerns around Diwali. After the apex court order, Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik had directed the DCPs of the 13 police districts to ensure that crackers are not sold in the city. Besides, special teams were also deployed in all districts to monitor the situation. Madhur Verma, PRO, Delhi Police said that 29 FIRs were also registered. He said that eight cases have been registered in the north district against the people found selling firecrackers, the maximum among all the districts. He informed that officials seized 368 kilogram of firecrackers from the southwest district, the maximum among all districts with Rohini a close second at 344.5 kg. ""No firecracker shop in the capital would be allowed to open till November 1. We have seized more than 1,200 kg of firecrackers and made 29 arrests so far from various areas of Delhi. Dozens of firecracker shops were forced to shut on Tuesday. We are following the apex court guidelines against shopkeepers found selling firecrackers and taking action as per law. The police is vigilant to ensure that no one violates the court directive,"" Verma said. Meanwhile, two Delhi Police personnel posted at the Mangolpuri Police Station in outer district were suspended for allegedly failing to curb the sale of firecrackers in their beat areas. The apex court had last week refused to modify its October 9 order to ban sale of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR this Diwali and expressed anguish that the order was being given a communal twist. The top court had earlier slapped a temporary ban on the sale of firecrackers in the Delhi-NCR till October 31, pointing to the adverse impact of bursting of the firecrackers witnessed year after year.

Further worsening of air quality may trigger an increase in parking fees by up to four times across the city in the next few days, they said. The measure, if required, will be enforced under the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority's (EPCA) Graded Response Action Plan, under which a series of measures will be taken based on the severity of air pollution during winter months. Measures under the ""very poor"" and ""severe"" categories of the plan came into force on Tuesday, under which the Badarpur Thermal Power Station has been shut and diesel-run generators banned in Delhi, among other actions. EPCA chairman Bhure Lal and member Sunita Narain announced the decision following a review meeting here. Narain said parking fees could be hiked in Delhi, despite the fact that a parking policy was still being worked out, if air pollution aggravated further. In case it touched alarming proportions, ""cars will have to be off the roads"", she added. ""DG sets will be banned only in Delhi, conditional to air quality index reaching to very poor or severe,"" said Narain. The environment body has also advised the residents of Delhi-NCR to use face masks whenever possible. It has also raised concerns over the existing landfill sites in the capital.

According to the medical experts, most of the patients are being diagnosed with bronchitis and advance asthma. Experts however believe the volume of patients would be lesser than previous year, counting on factors including the apex court's ban on cracker sales in Delhi and attempts to control stubble burning in neighbouring states. ""Patients have started coming to the OPDs complaining chest pains, breathing issues, asthma complications and exertion. Cases of asthma complications have increased already,"" All India Institute of Medical Sciences' Director Randeep Guleria, who is a pulmonologist himself, said. Experts also suggest cautions, suggesting use of air purifiers indoors if possible. In 2016 after Diwali, the major pollutant PM2.5 or particles in air with diameter less than 2.5 mm, reached an all time high with its level crossing 600 against the permissible limit of 60. According to the officials, Pulmonary OPD at AIIMS saw a 35 per cent hike after Diwali 2016, while Safdarjung Hospital saw 20-25 percent surge in the number of patients complaining of chest congestion, lung and respiratory issues. Dr A.K Rai, outgoing medical superintendent at Safdarjung Hospital, said the post-Diwali 2016 situation seems to be returning in the OPDs, while he expects the number of patients to go up in the coming days. ""Patients have started complaining of chest pains and other respiratory issues. Basically this is related to the smog, as when the temperature will drop, the patients will certainly increase... however, we expect that the surge to be lesser than last year due to different measures being taken this year, which last years were discussed only after situation worsened,"" Rai said. Air pollution intensified in the National Capital on Saturday, with the the average PM2.5 level in Delhi till 5.30 p.m. placed under 'very poor', according to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). While the stubble burning goes unabated in neighbouring Punjab, Haryana and even parts of Delhi, as per satellite images by NASA FIRMS Web Fire Mapper, and health advisories cautioning people against prolonged exertion, patients have already started flocking OPDs. ""Last year after Diwali, we saw several cases of pneumonia... some patients died too,"" Arvind Kumar, Chairman, Centre for Chest Surgery at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, and former Professor of Surgery at AIIMS, said. With forecasts warning further worsening of situation over the period of next 4 hours, SAFAR had already cautioned those with lung issues, the very young or old and those with breathing problems to take precautions.

The division bench headed by Justice VM Kanade said that the shops should ideally be set up in open spaces to minimise the damage caused in case of any accidents. “Shops where firecrackers are stored should not be located in residential areas,” it said, adding that the civic bodies must ensure strict compliance of the rules related to the storage of small explosive devices. The court noted that it is a common knowledge that there is a large demand for firecrackers. It said that there is nothing wrong with businessmen taking advantage of this demand and taking efforts to supply firecrackers. However, they have to ensure safety regulations are strictly adhered to while storing the same. The Chhattisgarh government too imposed a ban on the use of firecrackers with high decibels and those highly contributing to air pollution during Diwali. Besides, a special public awareness campaign will be undertaken seeking support of people to prevent air and sound pollution during the ensuing festival. Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board (CECB) Chairman Aman Kumar Singh in a circular to all division commissioners, collectors and superintendents of police has asked them to take effective steps to ensure restriction on sale and use of high decibel firecrackers in their respective areas. Moreover, as per the circular, the bursting of the firecrackers will be prohibited between 10 pm to 6 am. Also a distance of at least 100 metres should be maintained from hospitals, educational institutes, religious places while bursting crackers. The development comes a day after the Supreme Court banned the sale of firecrackers in Delhi-NCR till November 1. Meanwhile, the RSS has termed the apex court order as anti-Hindu. On the other hand, Tripura Governor Tathagata Roy took to micro-blogging site Twitter to express his views on the matter. He said the SC could next impose ban on the Hindu cremations. “First Dahi Handi, now crackers.

However, on Friday, the Ambient Air Quality Index (AQI) for Delhi shown by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) was recorded at 182, under 'Moderate' category, against 'Poor' on Thursday and Wednesday. Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10), as per the CPCB monitoring stations, were the major reason behind the deteriorating air quality. Meanwhile, the officials from CPCB said to have received information about incidents of stubble burning in parts of Punjab and Haryana, where farmers face short deadline to prepare their fields for potato and wheat cultivation, slated from November first week. ""The incidents (of stubble burning) are being reported now, but not on a large scale yet. The condition of air is however dependent on many factors, including the concentration of emissions that reaches Delhi and that which is dispersed,"" an official from the CPCB told IANS. The areas where stubble burning is being reported are at the aerial distance of about 150 to 200 kms from Delhi. According to a forecast by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), Delhi will see moderate air quality for the next three days, though the PM2.5 and PM10 (particles in air with diameter less than 2.5 and 10 mm) was still higher than the permissible limit. PM2.5 is one of the major and common pollutant with direct consequences on life expectancy. On Friday, Delhi's PM10 was recorded at 142 microgrammes/cubic metre and PM2.5 at 74 microgrammes/cubic metre. For Saturday, SAFAR has projected it to be 138 and 70 respectively. The standards prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for PM2.5 is 10 microgrammes per cubic m annual mean and 25 for 24 hours mean, and for PM10, prescribed international standards is 20 microgrammes per cubic m annual mean and 50 for 24 hours mean). However, the Indian standard keeps it at PM2.5 at 40 (annual) and 60 (24 hour mean), while for PM10, it's 100 units (24-hour mean). According to the private weather forecasting agency Skymet, the present strong north-westerly winds (from Punjab and Haryana) entering Delhi are also a reason for slight deterioration in the air quality. However, the wind direction is projected to change in the next two days, which may aggravate the air quality situation of Delhi. ""From October 18 onwards, easterly winds from Uttar Pradesh will start. The wind speed would be less, thus concentration of pollutants may be slightly higher,"" Mahesh Palawat, director Skymet said. On Wednesday, farmers from Punjab registered their protest at National Green Tribunal (NGT), stating that the state government, as directed by the tribunal, is not providing them with adequate resources to dispose the stubble and other residue in an environment-friendly way. This, they said, is forcing them to opt for the traditional method of burning it -- a major reason leading to poor air quality of the national capital. ""We are not left with any option but to burn the residue. The state machinery is not helping and managing the stubble otherwise is very expensive,"" said Omkar Singh, a member of farmer organisation Bhartiya Kisan Union in Punjab. ""This is the reason many farmers have already started burning the paddy residue."" The National Capital last year (November to December) suffered from one of the major air quality crises of the decade after Diwali. The after-Diwali effect (emissions from crackers and other sources), large-scale stubble burning in neighbouring Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh led to a cumulative effect of dragging the AQI under 'Severe' category, thereafter the AQI (PM2.5 and PM10) breached the 500 mark at all locations in Delhi. Schools were closed following government advisories and outdoor activities were officially discouraged.

The day-long average of PM 2.5 and PM 10, which are ultrafine particulates, were 178 and 94 micrograms per cubic metre (ug/m3), while the air quality index of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) was poor. A ""poor"" AQI essentially means that people will have breathing discomfort on prolonged exposure to such air. On further dip in air quality, AQI will turn ""very poor"" and ""severe"". An official of the CPCB attributed the rise in pollution levels to ground-level activities such as burning of paddy stubble in neighbouring Punjab and Haryana and meteorological conditions including a cyclonic circulation and a fall in wind speed that traps pollutants. According to the forecast of SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research), the level of PM 2.5 may breach the 100 mark while PM 10 will be around 190 ug/m3 in the next three days. The prescribed standards for PM 2.5 and PM 10 are 60 and 100 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively. Nine out of 17 monitoring stations of CPCB recorded poor quality air, while two recorded very poor quality air. Four stations of SAFAR had air quality in the poor category. Winter is a critical time in Delhi as meteorological conditions trap air pollutants near the earth's surface. The volume of pollutants also rises alarmingly due to the burning of paddy stubble in Haryana and Punjab and bursting of firecrackers during the festive season. Last year, the air quality of Delhi had plunged and a dense blanket of smog had kept the city shrouded for over a week in November, soon after the Diwali festivities, prompting the authorities to announce closure of schools among other emergency measures.

Air pollution has reached an alarming rate. In metropolitan cities where there is more vehicles and less of trees, air pollution is increasing at a fast pace. It is already known that air pollution poses a big threat to health, now, a recent study has found that even less exposure to air pollution can also harm kindeys and increase their damage risk. The study suggests that there really is no ""safe"" level for air pollution, as even the lowest levels of particulate matter in the air can do great harm to the kidneys and lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD), a decline in glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)- the rate of blood flow through the kidneys as well as end stage renal disease (ESRD) - the last stage of CKD. ""Even levels below the limit set by the EPA were harmful to the kidneys. This suggests that there is no safe level of air pollution,"" said Ziyad Al-Aly, Director at the VA Saint Louis Health Care System in Missouri, US. ""Our findings demonstrate a significant association between exposure to PM2.5 and risk of incident CKD, eGFR decline, and ESRD,"" Al-Aly added. When we breathe, tiny particles present in the dirty air pass through our lungs and enter our bloodstream to finally reach kidneys. Kidneys -our body's main filters - sift these particles out of the blood. However, excess exposure to these harmful pollutants reduces the efficacy of the process, Al-Aly explained. For the study, which will appear in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (JASN), the team examined information on 2,482,737 US veterans who were followed for a median of 8.5 years. Air pollution levels were also assessed using space-borne sensors from NASA satellites. The researchers found a linear relationship between air pollution levels and risk of experiencing kidney function decline and of developing kidney disease or kidney failure. Each year in the US, 44,793 new cases of chronic kidney disease and 2438 new cases of kidney failure are attributed to particulate matter air pollution exceeding the Environmental Protection Agency's recommended limit, researchers said. Besides causing cardiovascular problems, air pollution may also increase the risk of asthama. Air pollution is more dangerous for those having respiratory problems. It also messes up with immune system making the body weak.

The court, which lifted ""for the time being"" its earlier order suspending permanent licences for sale of fire crackers in the national capital region, said no specific action plan has been laid down by Delhi government to make children aware of the hazards of bursting crackers. ""Have the steps already taken by the concerned authorities reduced air pollution during Diwali? It seems to us that the steps so far taken by Government of NCT of Delhi are limited to issuing directions, which is merely paperwork,"" a bench of Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta said. It observed that only general directions were issued in the past to schools to sensitise the students and staff about the ill-effects and health hazards of bursting fireworks. ""No specific plan of action has been laid down by the Government of NCT of Delhi to make children aware of the hazards of bursting fireworks and the existing awareness campaigns have been allowed to drift over the last one year,"" it said, adding ""there is no information on the success or failure of these campaigns"". The bench noted that the Delhi government's response was ""lethargic with the absence of any keenness to take proactive steps"". ""This is disconcerting. It is high time that governmental authorities realise that the cost of ill health (particularly among children) is far greater in psycho-social terms than in financial and economic terms. The adage that 'prevention is better than cure' is fully applicable in the present circumstances,"" it said. The bench also noted that there was no response from the states within the NCR, which gave the impression that air pollution was not a problem for them despite the ill-effects and health hazards of bursting fireworks. ""There must be a concerted effort by the powers that be to ensure awareness and sensitisation of the people in Delhi and NCR, particularly children, of the health hazards of indiscriminate use of fireworks,"" it said. The top court said that unless urgent steps are taken, there could be an adverse impact on children's health and it would be to ""nobody's benefit but to everybody's detriment"". Referring to the dangerous levels of air pollution in Delhi after Diwali last year, the bench said persons living in Delhi during that time would have experienced choking effects of breathing in polluted air and tremendous increase in the use and sale of face masks and air purifiers. ""In the absence of any concerted plan of action implemented by the governmental authorities, the residents responded in an ad-hoc manner by purchasing face masks and air purifiers. There is no doubt that an effective and longer lasting solution is necessary,"" the bench said. It also observed that there was no doubt that residents of the NCR were entitled to breathe unpolluted air and protection of their health from the adverse consequences of breathing in polluted air caused by bursting of fireworks. The Delhi government, in its affidavit filed in the apex court, had said that school children were being informed about the hazards of indiscriminate bursting of fireworks and there were 'anti-fire crackers' campaigns also.

661,IndiaTV News,https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/world-china-planning-to-ban-petrol-diesel-cars-to-boost-production-of-electric-vehicles-400887,"China planning to ban petrol, diesel cars; to boost production of electric vehicles","Published : Sep 11, 2017 17:45 IST, Updated : Sep 11, 2017 17:45 IST","In an attempt to control air pollution and restrict traffic congestion, China, the world’s leading automobile market, is now planning to ban petrol and diesel cars and increase the production of electric vehicles. Attending an automobile forum over the weekend, Xin Guobin, China's vice minister of industry and information technology said that Beijing has started research on a timetable to phase out production and sales of fossil fuel cars. Though Xin gave no details on the timeframe, he said, ""The measures would surely bring profound changes to the sector's development."" The plan would follow decisions by France and Britain which have announced plans to ban the manufacturing and sales of cars running on traditional fuels. Several Chinese cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, have already imposed severe restrictions on sale of new cars to contain air pollution and to restrict traffic congestion. The minister's statement followed similar moves of several countries to end the era of gas-powered vehicles to cut emissions and reduce pollution, state-run Xinhua news agency reported today. In July, French Ecology Minister Nicolas Hulot had announced that France would end sales of petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040 as part of the country's plan to meet its targets under the Paris climate accord. The same month, the British government followed suit with a similar plan eyeing 2040 as a deadline to stop sales of new fossil fuel cars. Analysts say that while there is little doubt that new energy vehicles (NEVs) will eventually prevail, how long the switch takes remains to be seen and depends a lot on infrastructure and technology improvements as well as how fast automakers can adapt. China manufactured and sold over 28 million vehicles in 2016, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers. China has been implementing a slew of measures, including tax exemptions, discounts for car purchases and an order for government organisations to buy more new energy vehicles (NEVs). Last year, China sold 507,000 NEVs, an increase of 53 per cent year on year. Sales of pure electric vehicles surged 65.1 per cent year on year to 409,000, accounting for 80 per cent of new energy vehicle sales, the Xinhua report said. An earlier guideline by the State Council, China's cabinet, said the country would build more than 12,000 new charging stations before 2020 to fulfil the demands of over 5 million NEVs. Zhong Shi, an industry analyst, said that China might adopt a deadline earlier than 2040 as it would be easier for the country to make the change given its relatively short history of car use. Meanwhile, proposing a date later than 2040 would mean China being left behind in the green drive, a scenario the government is seeking to avoid, Zhong said. According to a road map compiled by the Society of Automotive Engineers of China, entrusted by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the share of NEVs sales should reach more than 40 per cent of total auto sales by 2030. Qiu Kaijun, an industry observer, holds a different view, believing it will take much longer for China to make the switch, due to its massive market. China may adopt a differentiated timetable with big cities like Beijing and Shanghai achieving the goal as early as 2030 while less developed regions at a later time, he told CNR News. In light of recent global development, it is only a matter of time for traditional fuel cars to fade into history, Qui said. The most sensitive to market trends, leading industrial players have been quick to respond. Carmaker Volvo said in July that all its models would have an electric motor starting in 2019. GM, Volkswagen, Ford, Daimler and many other automakers also have plans to beef up NEVs production. China now leads the world in new energy vehicle (NEV) development, according to Xinhua report. Chinese auto companies including BYD, BAIC and Geely ranks among the top brands worldwide in terms of electric car sales last year, according to the China Passenger Car Association. International cooperation on NEV production is also gearing up. China has pledged to cut its carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030 and raise the share of non-fossil energy use in total consumption to about 20 per cent.

According to the study, hotter temperatures speed up the chemical reactions that create air pollutants like ozone and fine particulate matters, which impact public health. Locations that get drier may also have worse air pollution because of less removal by rain and increased fires and windblown dust. As trees respond to higher temperatures, they will also emit more organic pollutants, the researchers said. ""As climate change affects air pollutant concentrations, it can have a significant impact on health worldwide, adding to the millions of people who die from air pollution each year,"" said lead researcher Jason West, Associate Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. For the study which appeared in the journal Nature Climate Change, the team used an ensemble of several global climate models to determine the number of premature deaths that would occur due to ozone and particulate matter in 2030 and 2100. For each model, the team assessed the projected changes in ground-level air pollution that could be attributed to future climate change. They then overlaid these changes spatially on the global population, accounting for both population growth and expected changes in susceptibility to air pollution. Five out of eight models predicted there will be more premature deaths in 2030, and seven of nine models in 2100. ""Our finding that most models show a likely increase in deaths is the clearest signal yet that climate change will be detrimental to air quality and health,"" West noted. In addition to exacerbating air pollution-related deaths, climate change is expected to affect health through changes in heat stress, access to clean water and food, severe storms and the spread of infectious diseases, the researchers said.

But we’re childishly wrong! If you too believe the same, then let us correct you. According to a new study, the car cabins contain extremely high levels of harmful particulate matter, twice the amount previously thought. The findings revealed that the pollution levels inside the cars contain twice the amount of harmful chemicals that cause oxidative stress. It is capable enough to cause respiratory and heart diseases, cancer and some neurodegenerative diseases as well. ""We found that people are likely getting a double whammy of exposure in terms of health during rush-hour commutes,"" said Michael Bergin, professor at the Duke University in North Carolina.

In combination, the exposure triggers an overreaction that can be destructive to healthy cells and DNA, the researchers said, in the paper published in the journal Atmospheric Environment. To analyse what car drivers go through when they drive the car during rush hour, the researchers from strapped specially designed the sampling devices that draws in air at the same rate to human lungs. They fit the device on the passenger seat of cars and completed more than 60 rush hour journeys in downtown Atlanta. The devices showed detestably dangerous results. It had twice as much particulate matter as the roadside sensore. It is because, ""the chemical composition of exhaust changes very quickly, even in the space of just a few feet"", explained Heidi Vreeland, doctoral student at the Duke University. ""And morning sun heats the roadways, which causes an updraft that brings more pollution higher into the air,"" Vreeland added.

A study of nearly 280,000 women in the United States has found that living in areas with a high level of fine particles from air pollution may increase a woman's chance of having dense breasts - a well-established risk factor for breast cancer. The University of Florida study found that for everyone, unit increase in fine particle concentration (PM2.5), a woman's chance of having dense breasts was increased by 4 per cent. Women with dense breasts were around 20 per cent more likely to have been exposed to higher concentrations of PM2.5. Conversely, women with less dense, or breasts with more fatty tissue, were 12 per cent less likely to have been exposed to high concentrations of PM2.5. Breast density is measured by mammography and reflects the relative amounts of different tissue types in the breast. Breasts with a majority of fatty tissue are easier to interpret by mammography and so abnormalities become easier to spot. Dense breasts contain a higher percentage of fibroglandular tissue which obscures mammography and makes it difficult to identity abnormalities such as a breast tumour. Lead author Lusine Yaghjyan said: ""Our findings suggest that previously reported geographic variation in breast density could, in part, be explained by different air pollution patterns in urban and rural areas. Breast density is a well-established and strong breast cancer risk factor so future studies are warranted to determine if the observed associations are causal, which if confirmed may have implications for risk prevention."" Also Read: Beware Girls! Colouring hair can increase the risk of ‘Breast Cancer’ The researchers also looked at the association between ozone exposure and breast density among the 280,000 women included in the study. They found that every one unit increase in ozone concentration was associated with a 3 percent lower chance of having dense breasts. Yaghjyan explained: ""We found a positive association between fine particle concentration exposure and breast density but an inverse association between ozone exposure and breast density. This is an intriguing result that warrants further investigation to unpick any possible biological mechanism that might cause ozone exposure to reduce a woman's chance of having dense breasts."" The study is published in the journal Breast Cancer Research.

The blueprint was submitted to the standing committee of the municipal People's Congress for deliberation on Tuesday, Xinhua news agency reported. Beijing, one of the world's most polluted city, aims to cut the concentration of hazardous fine particle matter PM 2.5 to 56 micrograms per cubic metre in 2020 and 35 micrograms per cubic metre in 2030, according to the document.


Authorities will use tough environmental standards to force industry upgrades and step up regional environmental inspections to tackle air pollution, said Wei Chenglin, head of the Beijing Municipal Planning and Land Resources Management Committee.


In 2016, the average density of PM 2.5 in Beijing was 73 micrograms per cubic metre, down 9.9 per cent from the previous year, official data showed.


Restricted by water resources, Beijing aims to cap its population at 23 million in 2020 and keep it at that level for the long term, said Wei.


The number of the city's permanent residents grew marginally by 0.1 per cent to 21.7 million in 2016.


Besides the restriction on population growth, the city plans to shrink the rural and urban construction land while expanding its ecological control area.


Meanwhile, the city seeks to tackle other ""urban illnesses,"" including traffic jams, through more subways.


In 2020, the total length of the metro rail system in Beijing will reach 1,000 km, said Wei. At the end of 2016, the total metro rail length hit 574 km.


Beijing will give priority to the development of its public transport system and use it to steer city expansion, the official said.

Delhi and the neighbouring region’s air quality has fallen beyond limits, Professor Raj Kumar, head of the Pulmonary Medicine Department at the National Centre of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (NCAAI), confirmed it in a seminar conducted by Director of Environment and Social Development Association (SEDA) Jitendra Nagar ""In winter, the particulate matter (PM) 10 and PM 2.5 pass critical limits. The particulate matters contain hazardous elements of carbon monoxide, SO2, nitrous oxides and lead. Children and older persons are more vulnerable to its effects, which surface after 24 hours of exposure,"" Kumar said. ""The time periods between 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. are critical, during which the air emits the highly polluted elements,"" he added. ""Indoor air pollution, which is largely ignored, is also very hazardous to human beings,"" Kumar said. ""In fact, it has been found that indoor air pollution is the second largest factor for human death. Kitchens, especially in rural areas, are the main sources of indoor air pollution as meals are cooked on open fire. In urban areas also, coal is used in down-trodden sections of the society which generates carbon monoxide,"" he added. Kumar said that with the ongoing state of affairs, Delhi is being termed as the 'asthma capital' of the world. He suggested that carpets should not be used as they contain pests and one cannot disinfect them despite dense cleaning. Ganesh Hospital Managing Director Archana Sharma, who was a co-sponsor of the seminar, said that during the first three months of pregnancy, indoor air pollution affects the unborn child hazardously. She demanded that the study of the environment should be included in medical education. Chief Architect and Town Planner of Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA) Ishtiyak Ahmad said that in view of the deteriorating air quality due to construction activities, the authority has increased financial penalty on violators of environment rules from the minimum of Rs 10,000 to Rs 5 lakh. The seminar, conducted at the Institute of Management Technology here. Besides IMT students, was atteded by Ghaziabad Mayor Ashu Verma and Uttar Pradesh legislator from the city Suresh Bansal.

According to a new study, the air Indians breathe is turning more toxic by the day and an average of two deaths take place daily due to air pollution. Children and senior citizens are at the high risk of getting affected due to inhaling of unhealthy air. The study published in medical journal The Lancet, said that over a million Indians die every year due to air pollution and some of the worst polluted cities of the world are in India. The study released this week but based on 2010 data estimated that globally 2.7-3.4 million preterm births may be associated with PM2.5 exposure and South Asia is the worst hit accounting for 1.6 million pre-term births. The study said that causes of air pollution and climate change are intricately linked and needed to be tackled together. The Lancet concluded that climate change posed both a potentially catastrophic risk to human health while conversely being the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century if the right steps are taken. The smog over northern India is extracting a heavy toll, every minute two lives are lost in India due to ambient air pollution, the study said. Recently, 48 leading scientists released the study and they find that Patna and New Delhi the worst polluted cities of the world for PM 2.5 levels or the fine particulate matter that hurts the heart most. The study noted that a broader evidence base on interrelated health and climate change trends will notably help demonstrate clear co-benefits of action. An estimated 18,000 people die every day due to air pollution exposure, making it the world's largest single environmental health risk. The World Bank in turn estimated that it costs the global economy USD 225 billion a year in related lost labour income. Contradicting some of the Indian reports, The Lancet said that coal-fired power stations contribute to 50 per cent of the ambient air pollution. Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Anil Madhav Dave recently admitted in Parliament that the country spends a mere Rs 7 crore annually on monitoring air pollution for a vast country of India's size with a 1.3 billion population. He had also said no credible study to quantify number of people who have developed lung and allied diseases or number of deaths directly as a result of air pollution is available. Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan, a trained physician himself, says, ""Pollution when it starts affecting lungs especially in little children can be a killer, it is like a slow poison and there is no reason for me not to be worried, a lot has been done, but still a lot that needs to be done."" Meanwhile, called The Lancet Countdown, this study will report annually in The Lancet. With inputs from across the world, some 16 institutions are academic partners of the initiative, including University College London, Tsinghua University and the Centre for Climate & Security among others. This is special collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) to promote synergies, collaborate on data sources, and ensure strong engagement with Ministries of Health. Dr Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum, Head of the Health andClimate Change team at the World Health Organization, said, ""The Paris Agreement was a landmark achievement - the challenge now is to meet the targets agreed by world leaders. The WHO is working directly with countries to provide evidence of the specific health risks that each of them faces, and the health opportunities of a resilient, low carbon future - as well as the support that they need to respond to this defining health issue of our time."" According to the WHO, compared with a future without climate change, the following additional deaths for the year 2030 are projected, 38,000 due to heat exposure in elderly people, 48,000 due to diarrhoea, 60,000 due to malaria, and 95,000 due to childhood undernutrition. The WHO projects a dramatic decline in child mortality, and this is reflected in declining climate change impacts from child malnutrition and diarrhoeal disease between 2030 and 2050. On the other hand, by the 2050s, deaths related to heat exposure (over 100,000 per year) are projected to increase. Impacts are greatest under a low economic growth scenario because of higher rates of mortality projected in low- and middle-income countries. By 2050, impacts of climate change on mortality are projected to be greatest in south Asia. These results indicate that climate change will have a significant impact on child health by the 2030s. The World Bank estimated that 5.5 million lives were lost in 2013 to diseases associated with outdoor and household air pollution, causing human suffering and reducing economic development. The reports calls air pollution and climate change a potentially catastrophic risk to human health. The silver lining is that citizens are waking up and the study finds that almost 60 per cent of the people surveyed in India feel climate change substantially harms people.

The air that Indians breathe is turning more toxic by the day and an average of two deaths take place daily due to air pollution, according to medical journal The Lancet. The study released this week but based on 2010 data estimates that globally 2.7-3.4 million preterm births may be associated with PM 2.5 exposure and South Asia is the worst hit accounting for 1.6 million pre-term births. Causes of air pollution and climate change are intricately linked and needed to be tackled together, the study said. Climate change posed both a ""potentially catastrophic risk to human health"", while conversely being ""the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century"" if the right steps are taken, the study published in The Lancet says. The smog over northern India is extracting a heavy toll, every minute two lives are lost in India due to ambient air pollution, it says. Further, according an estimate by the World Bank, this would amount to a whopping USD 38 billion loss in income towards labour in India. Air pollution has also emerged as the deadliest form of pollution and the fourth leading risk factor for premature deaths worldwide, it says. Recently, 48 leading scientists released the study and they find that Patna and New Delhi the worst polluted cities of the world for PM 2.5 levels or the fine particulate matter that hurts the heart most. The study notes that a broader evidence base on interrelated health and climate change trends will notably help demonstrate clear co-benefits of action. An estimated 18,000 people die every day due to air pollution exposure, making it the world's largest single environmental health risk. The World Bank in turn estimates it costs the global economy USD 225 billion a year in related lost labour income. Contradicting some of the Indian reports, The Lancet says coal fired power plants contribute to 50 per cent of the ambient air pollution. Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Anil Madhav Dave recently admitted in Parliament that the country spends a mere Rs 7 crore annually on monitoring air pollution for a vast country of India's size with a 1.3 billion population. He had also said no credible study to quantify number of people who have developed lung and allied diseases or number of deaths directly as a result of air pollution is available. Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan, a trained physician himself, says, ""Pollution when it starts affecting lungs especially in little children can be a killer, it is like a slow poison and there is no reason for me not to be worried, a lot has been done, but still a lot that needs to be done."" Meanwhile, called The Lancet Countdown, this study will report annually in The Lancet. With inputs from across the world, some 16 institutions are academic partners of the initiative, including University College London, Tsinghua University and the Centre for Climate & Security among others. This is special collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) to promote synergies, collaborate on data sources, and ensure strong engagement with Ministries of Health.

Expressing concern over the report, the government on Friday said that though the menace was a serious issue, air pollution was not the only reason that led to so many deaths. Environment Minister Anil Madhav Dave said that India does not work on reports from ‘outside’ and trusts its own reports. ""We do not work on reports from outside. India trusts its own reports. We decide based on our own reports. Pollution is a subject and (people) are affected due to it. We will stress on research done by Indian institutions,"" Dave said when asked about the recent reports. Asked if the reports were not correct, he said, ""I am notsaying that. People can make reports."" Asked whether he thinks pollution is a cause for death, Dave said, ""No that is not the (only) reason. There can be various other reasons."" Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan said that pollution destroys lungs of children and can also be a ‘killer’ as he asserted that any report coming from bodies like the World Health Organization (WHO) should be taken ‘seriously’. ""Pollution starts destroying your lungs. It starts affecting the lungs of young children, the kids, the infants, when their lungs have not developed that immune system or the capacity to fight it out, and many times, it can be a killer also. A lot has been done and is being done and is being planned, thought of and implemented. But there is still a need for a lot more to be done. Anything which is being published by the WHO, as a person who has worked with the WHO for many years, I feel that it should be taken seriously by everyone all across the world,"" he said. Earlier this week, a recent study, 'State of Global Air 2017', stated that surpassing China, India now accounts for the maximum number of premature deaths from air pollution in the world. It also noted that both India and China together accounted for 52 per cent of the total global deaths attributable to PM2.5 and recorded some 1.1 million early deaths each due to it in 2015. The World Health Organization (WHO) had earlier said that air pollution is killing nearly eight lakh people annually in the South East Asian Region with India alone accounting for over 75 per cent of the casualties caused by cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer.

According to a new study, the Asian country, second most populous in the world, has witnessed a 150 per cent rise in lives lost over the past two decades from ozone pollutants. The 'State of Global Air 2017' report said that over half of the deaths across the world caused by air pollution were in India and China where 2.2 million (22 lakh) people died in 2015. The two countries together accounted for 52 per cent of the total global deaths. ""As the most populous countries, India and China account for most of the ozone-attributable Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) deaths across all years, but India accounts for much (about 67 per cent) of the global increase since 1990. Over the last 25 years, India experienced a nearly 150 per cent increase in ozone-attributable deaths, while China's number remained about the same,"" the report said. It suggested that India outpaced China in 2015, with 8.6 ozone-related deaths for every 100,000 people, compared to China's 5.3. According to the report, while 11,08,100 deaths were attributed to PM2.5 exposure in China in 2015, in India, it was 10,90,400. Around 92 per cent of the world's population lives in areas with unhealthy air. COPD mortality rate decreased by about 1 per cent over this time period in the US and Indonesia and remained relatively stable in Russia and the European Union. As with PM2.5-attributable mortality, the increases in deaths attributable to ozone exposure from 1990 to 2015 were driven by increases in concentrations of ozone throughout most of the globe by population aging and by the increased rates of mortality from COPD, especially in South Asia. The report said that among the 10 most populous countries and the European Union (EU), Bangladesh and India have the highest exposure to PM2.5, the ""steepest"" rise since 2010. ""In 2015, long-term exposure to PM2.5 contributed to 4.2 million deaths and to a loss of 103 million years of healthy life. China and India together accounted for 52 per cent of the total global deaths attributable to PM2.5. It found that increasing exposure and a growing and aging population have meant that India now rivals China for among the highest air pollution health burdens in the world, with both countries facing some 1.1 million early deaths due to it in 2015,"" it said. The 'State of Global Air 2017' is the first of a new series of annual reports and accompanying interactive website, designed by Health Effects Institute in cooperation with the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington and University of British Columbia.

According to a Times of India report, in economic terms, air pollution cost the two cities USD 10.66 billion (approx Rs 70,000 crore) in 2015, which is equivalent to about 0.71 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product. With higher pollution levels, the national capital recorded more premature deaths due to ingestion of PM 10 (fine particulate matter measuring 10 microns) from vehicle exhaust, construction dust and other industrial processes. Moreover, the casualties went up from 19,716 in 1995 to 48,651 in 2015. In Mumbai, the comparative figure rose from 19,291 to 32,014 in 20 years. According to the study, air pollution was also responsible for 23 million cases of restricted activity days (RAD) – either less productive days or days off work for individuals – in Mumbai in 2015. The economic cost of PM 10 exposure rose by around 60 per cent in Mumbai, from USD 2.68 million in 1995 (approx Rs 18 crore) to USD 4.26 billion (approx Rs 29,000 crore) in 2015. Cost to Delhi jumped by 135 per cent in the same period to hit USD 6.39 billion (approx Rs 44,000 crore), the study found. According to the report, researchers believe that these estimates are likely to be an undercount of actual costs, mortality and morbidity, since the study looked only at the impact of PM10 and to a lesser extent PM2.5.

Expressed concern over the increasing air pollution, a bench of Justice MB Lokur and Justice PC Pant on Tuesday said that some victims of air pollution suffer due to inefficient systems and non-implementation of norms. ""This pollution problem is very serious. If you talk for years for a solution, then it is a problem,"" said the bench after it was told by amicus curiae and senior advocate Harish Salve that there was a need to ensure 100 per cent compliance of Pollution Under Control (PUC) Certificates and linking them with the insurance of vehicles done every year. The bench asked Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar, appearing for the Central government, to specify the number of PUC centres in Delhi, and was told that there are 962 such centres in the capital with each of them inspecting around 5,000 vehicles every three months. Show cause notices have also been issued to some 174 centres for irregularities and licences of 14 centres have been cancelled, he said, adding that licences of 75 centres have been suspended and warning notices issued to 78 such centres, Kumar told the bench. Hearing this, the court asked the Central government to file a status report regarding show cause notices issued to PUC centres. It also directed the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) to inspect all 962 PUC centers and submit the report about their functioning. After the bench was informed that consultations among all stakeholders is being done regarding banning of petcoke and furnace oil as industrial fuel in Delhi-NCR region, it asked the government to file the status report in this regard before the next date of hearing on February 6. The bench also sought from Centre an Action Taken Report on setting up of real time Air Quality Monitoring Centres in Delhi-NCR region in compliance with its earlier order.

According to a report in Hindustan Times, the study released by Greenpeace on Wednesday says that millions of Indians are facing serious health hazards due to toxic air in major cities including Delhi. The study reveals that outdoor air pollution killed 3,283 people every day in India in 2015, compared to 3,233 in China. “The data shows that China’s strong measures in tackling pollution have resulted in a steady reduction in the particulate levels. With India, however, the trend is downward. The year 2015, especially, has been the worst-ever recorded for premature deaths by exposure to pollutants,” Sunil Dahiya, Greenpeace’s India campaigner, was quoted as saying by HT. The Greenpeace study was based on data from the Global Burden of Diseases project by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle. The study further adds that there is a direct relation between exposure to outdoor air pollution — ozone and particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers — and premature deaths. The new study comes days after Delhi faced one of the worst spikes in air pollution that left the city blanketed in thick smog for more than a week since Diwali on October 30. Last year, the World Health Organisation (WHO) had ranked Delhi as the most polluted city in the world.

It said that the smog in India's capital and its adverse impact on the daily lives of its citizens will become a commonplace phenomenon if not dealt with. “With every breath, children in Delhi are suffering. Delhi is a wake up call to the world on air pollution. It is a wake up call to all countries and cities where air pollution levels have resulted in death and illness amongst children. It is a wake up a call that very clearly tells us: unless decisive actions are taken to reduce air pollution, the events we are witnessing in Delhi over the past week are likely to be increasingly common,"" UNICEF said in a statement. Air pollution level hit record high in New Delhi in the past week following Diwali celebration. The capital's smog, said to be its worst in 17 years, lead to the closure of the city's over 5,000 schools to minimise the risk for children to be exposed to the polluted air and resulted in an estimated 4.41 million children missing three days of school, the United Nations Children's Fund said. According to estimates, air pollution levels hit 999 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter in some areas of the national capital, more than 15-16 times the limit considered safe. The agency underscored that the alarming level of air pollution, which is major contributing factor to some of the most deadly diseases children face, is not just a challenge in Delhi but for many cities around the world. Sounding an alarming note, the agency said almost a million children under-5 die from pneumonia per year – and about half of those cases are directly linked with air pollution. ""Air pollution levels in other Indian cities, such as Varanasi and Lucknow, have been equally extreme in recent days. And over the past year, air pollution levels in London, Beijing, Mexico City, Los Angeles and Manila have exceeded international guidelines - in some cases by considerable margin,"" it said. UNICEF had said in a recent analysis that globally 300 million children live in areas with the most toxic levels of outdoor air pollution - exceeding six times international guidelines. It emphasised that nations need stronger measures to cut back on the sources of air pollution, which cannot be contained within borders and spreads across regions. ""Air pollution moves across borders, both national ones as well as subnational ones, and so we will need coherent government policies to address these transboundary risks,"" it said. UNICEF said providing children with access to good quality healthcare is a major part of protecting them from air pollution and treatment and prevention programmes for pneumonia, as well as other respiratory conditions, can significantly reduce the chance a child falls sick or dies. ""At a global scale, we need better monitoring of air pollution. When a child, a mother, a father or caregiver know how bad the air is on a real-time basis, they can begin to take actions to reduce exposure,"" it said, adding that pregnant mothers, and others who are at especially high risk, should do their best to avoid areas where air pollution is at its highest.

In addition to Delhi government’s inaction, the High Court also held stubble burning in Punjab robbing 20 million Delhiites of three years of their life expectancy, which amounted to ""genocide"" and ""murder"". ""It is killing us,"" a bench of justices Badar Durrez Ahmed and Ashutosh Kumar said, adding that the grave situation was leading to the ""decimation"" of more than 60 million life years or one million deaths. “As per the report, air pollution in a city like Delhi deducts three years from your life expectancy. Delhi has a population of over 20 million. So 60 million life years are being decimated and killed. It is akin to one million deaths. If this is not murder, what is? This is genocide. Government inaction is the culprit for shortening of life. Look at the enormity of the matter. Something drastic needs to be done. Is vote bank more important or the man or woman behind the vote,"" it said, adding ""Punjab (stubble burning) is killing us"". The court said as per various reports, Delhi has been termed as the worst city in India in terms of air quality. Bad air quality not only kills people, but also leads to respiratory ailments, the court said and added that these led to reduction in working population and loss of productivity. ""In pure economic terms, look at the cost-benefit you would have if this issue of air pollution is addressed,"" the bench said while hearing a PIL initiated by the court on the issue of air pollution in the city. Last month, while hearing the air pollution matter, the high court had asked the states of UP, Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana to prevent stubble burning for which the national capital every year grappled with the menace of haze even after orders of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to stop the practice of burning of crop and agriculture. Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), meanwhile, showed the court satellite images from NASA showing the extent of biomass or crop burning in northern India. Referring to the images, the bench and amicus curiae Kailash Vasdev said the main culprit was Punjab where majority of fires were happening. Vasdev said that while Haryana and Rajasthan have taken steps like training farmers, employing new tools for cutting crops, recycling the biomass and using it for power generation, Punjab was only asking for money. He also said that as per Punjab's affidavit, it was bringing in political issues and angles as well as citing economic constraints in preventing biomass burning. Agreeing with the amicus, the bench also said the state appeared to be ""in denial"" even though the extent of biomass burning was ""much, much more"" there than in other states, with resultant smoke reaching as far as Madhya Pradesh. The bench then asked the counsel for Punjab how it would apologise to the people who have died and those who continue to suffer respiratory diseases due to air pollution caused by biomass burning. The court also asked how the state would make good the huge national economic loss that would have been caused due to closure of schools in Delhi and people falling sick and not being able to work. ""You have failed as a state,"" the bench remarked while referring to Punjab waiving off agricultural loans of over Rs 80000 crore, but being unable to arrange Rs 9900 crore for procuring ""rota and re-seeding machines"" to reduce biomass generated after harvesting. The counsel for Punjab, while defending the state, said the government may have been slow to start but it has taken steps like setting up biomass power plants. He said the state required around Rs 9900 crore for the machines and has written to the Centre. Rejecting the contentions, the bench said it had warned all the states well in advance on these issues. ""But you (Punjab) did nothing. There is dereliction of duty. Does your Chief Secretary intend to continue in that position? We are contemplating issuing contempt notice to him. You can reply to that,"" the court said and added ""put a stop to it immediately"". It also said that despite the advance warning, ""damage has been done"" and the actions of Punjab was akin to ""capital punishment"" for the people of Delhi. ""Literally capital punishment as the capital is punished and that too for no offence. People are being killed in the capital,"" the bench said.

Owing to the air pollution, there has been around 400 per cent surge in demand of air purifiers in the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR), a report said today. According to HomePunch, an e-commerce platform for home and kitchen appliances, more and more consumers are logging in to their platform to buy air purifiers. ""The sales surge is unexpected. We have alerted all our brands, their wholesale and retail networks to be ready with available stocks,"" said Sachin Goel, CEO, HomePunch, in a statement. E-commerce platforms such as Snapdeal, Flipkart and Amazon have recorded an unprecedented surge in the sale of air purifiers and masks as customers see them as viable option to protect themselves from the health-threatening thick cloud of smog that has been enshrouding Delhi since Diwali. According to Snapdeal, the category has seen an overall three-fold increase in demand this year compared to the same time last year. ""Between pre-Diwali and post-Diwali, we have already seen a seven-fold increase in the number of air purifiers and masks sold on Snapdeal,"" it added. Interestingly, the city-based portal has curated a special store for the category and is expecting a 10-fold surge in orders placed for air purifiers. Consumers are also opting for air purifiers on the go. Unit sales of car air purifiers in the first 5 days of November was 140 per cent more than that seen in the month of October for the devices on Snapdeal. Since the morning post-Diwali, the Delhi-NCR, parts of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana have been reeling under severe air pollution. The city’s air quality has steadily worsened over the years, a result of pollution from vehicles and industrial emissions. Apart from atmospheric dust, burning of crop stubble in farms also contributed to the thick cover of hazardous haze that has been shrouding the city for nearly a week. The air quality have levels of harmful PM 2.5 particles hovering at dangerous levels, something that has been seen in cities like Beijing. These fine particles less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter are linked to higher rates of chronic bronchitis, lung cancer and heart disease. E-commerce giant Flipkart, too, has seen a year-on-year growth of 2.5 times in sales in terms of units sold and 2.8X rise in revenue. The country’s largest e-commerce player said about 50 per cent of the air purifier demand is coming from Delhi, while 71 per cent of the demand is from the north zone. Amazon.in has also witnessed three-fold increase in unit sales of air purifiers in October this year (compared to the previous month) and 4X increase as against last October. ""About 50 per cent of our orders are coming from customers belonging to cities like Delhi, Gurgaon and Bangalore apart from other metros. With the onset of winters and the growing smog/fog situation in cities during this time of the year, we expect the customer demand for Air Purifiers to peak over the next three months,"" an Amazon.in spokesperson said. Sales of pollution masks have also jumped six times in the last few days on the US-based e-tailers India website with customer demand rising 13 times over last year. ""The highest number of orders for pollution masks were placed by customers on November 1 this year. The demand continues to be high from northern India with most orders coming from Delhi,"" the spokesperson said.

The Centre has been asked to inform the apex court about the policy, if any, to tackle the issue of rising hazardous haze in the national capital. Earlier in the day, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directed Delhi and the four neighbouring states to give complete mechanism on implementation of its directions to curb air pollution. ""What major step you have taken to curb the pollution?” the NGT asked the Delhi government. “This is a matter of life and death. You have forced the children to confine themselves to their houses. Even a mask has a limit. Beyond a degree of pollution, masks may be detrimental,” it observed. The tribunal said that all the three had done ‘nothing’ to combat the menace till yesterday. “Officers present here aren't revealing ground reality. All we see is construction work on Delhi-Chandigarh route that violates guidelines,” it said. “You have any data that shows reduction of smog? Why are you sprinkling water through cranes and not helicopters? Why couldn't you deploy helicopters for sprinkling water to improve air quality? You are playing jokes. Cranes which fix lights are given for sprinkling water,” the tribunal said, rebuking the city government. Lawyers, representing the three states admitted before the court that they had ‘not fully read’ a series of orders by the NGT against pollution. “Why you (three state governments) skipped reading our six judgements? Read all judgements first, analyze. What steps you propose?” it said. The green body ordered that no stone crusher and brick kiln will operate for one week. The Delhi government, in a first, yesterday issued a health advisory asking people to avoid highly-polluted areas and cautioned those with asthma and lung ailments not to venture out for any activities, even as the city continued to battle its worst smog in 17 years. Cases of severe breathlessness, asthma and allergy have sharply risen in Delhi as the city remains blanketed in thick layer of toxic air due to the smog. The situation earlier had prompted Delhi High Court to observe that it was akin to ‘living in a gas chamber’. The Centre had termed it an ‘emergency situation’ and called a meeting of Environment ministers of all neighbouring states. Meanwhile, schools in Delhi have been shut down till tomorrow, with reports suggesting that the city government was considering to include another session of the odd-even scheme to restrict the use of private cars on roads.

Lawyers, representing the three states admitted before the court that they had ‘not fully read’ a series of orders by the NGT against pollution. “Why you (three state governments) skipped reading our six judgements? Read all judgements first, analyze. What steps you propose?” it said. It also slammed the government for halting construction activities. “You are only issuing challans to poor people, not builders for pollution. How many challans for creating pollution? Builders have kept construction material on roads not covering it,” it said. On its decision to close the schools till tomorrow, the NGT said, “Delhi Schools closed? Did you do a study if outside or indoor pollution is more harmful?” The tribunal also asked the Punjab government about the major steps that it has taken to reduce crop burning. “How many machines have you provided to the farmers for agriculture waste disposals? If you had provided even Rs 1000 to the farmers, they would not have burnt the agriculture wastage like this,” it questioned. The Delhi government, in a first, yesterday issued a health advisory asking people to avoid highly-polluted areas and cautioned those with asthma and lung ailments not to venture out for any activities, even as the city continued to battle its worst smog in 17 years. The announcement comes on a day when the administration put into effect a number of measures, including halting of construction and demolition activities, starting of process of deregistration of 15-year-old diesel vehicles and imposition of ban on use of fire crackers. Cases of severe breathlessness, asthma and allergy have sharply risen in Delhi as the city remains blanketed in thick layer of toxic air due to the worst smog the capital has seen in 17 years.

The plea was filed by the Environment Pollution Control Authority which has sought proper monitoring of the worsening pollution level in the national capital and adjoining areas. Saying that the situation is a public emergency, the plea urged the apex court for stringent action. Director General at the Centre for Science and Environment, a Delhi-based organisation of environmental activists, Sunita Narain said, the Delhi government is coming up with an emergency action plan, but the court should monitor the measures. Agreeing to hear the matter, a bench of Chief Justice TS Thakur, Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice L Nageswara Rao yesterday said that the court has already passed the orders and they need to be implemented. The apex court was also given the report by the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority for NCR on the state of air pollution in the national capital territory. Narain also told the court that Uttar Pradesh and Haryana were diverting the heavy vehicles and other traffic so that they don't pass through the national capital but because of shortage of manpower, the diversion of traffic was not upto the desired levels. The EPCA in its report, titled Delhi's worst smog incident, says that the ""levels of PM 2.5 has increased by 1.4 times on November 5, 2016 as compared to Diwali. It is 14 times the standard on November 5, 2016 - a situation, which is both alarming and dangerous for human health"". Appreciating the steps announced by Delhi's Arvind Kejriwal government on Sunday to curb the alarming level of air pollution, the EPCA report says that ""if pollution is not reduced within the next 48 hours then Delhi government must take further steps to drastically reduce pollution, including odd-even (without exemptions) and further restrictions on commercial vehicle entry"". The report has called for short-term emergency measures to drastically reduce the current level of air pollution and strict enforcement of top court's December 16 directions for effective control of toxic and dangerous air pollution. It says that the current level of air pollution in Delhi was ""higher than what was recorded during the London smog incident of 1952 and certainly higher than what has been seen in Delhi ever"". The key cause of this extremely high pollution in Delhi and its vicinity,"" the EPCA report says, ""is a combination of factors that includes already high pollution because of numbers of vehicles, unchecked construction and road dust, garbage burning which got compounded by Diwali crackers and the burning of paddy residue by farmers in Punjab and Haryana including onset of winter and no wind"". The report says that the severe smog condition caused by all these must be ""treated as a public health emergency"", and sought strict enforcement of environment compensation charge (ECC) on Delhi-bound trucks and other steps directed by the top court in December last year.

However, monitoring agency SAFAR had 24-hour-average (rolling) level of respirable pollutants PM 2.5 and PM 10 in the 'severe' category at 622 and 808 micrograms per cubic metre respectively at 5 pm. The alarming levels of pollution failed to dissuade Chhat revellers though from bursting firecrackers early in the morning. The 24-hour-average Air Quality Index (AQI) recorded by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) was 423 as against Sunday's 497 which was the season's worst. The visibility also improved as the city witnessed sunshine after several days. ""The air quality has improved due to a little increase in wind speed, although the wind direction continues to be north-northwest. By Wednesday wind speed is likely to increase more and wind direction will also be easterly which is likely to further improve the air quality and turn it very poor from severe,"" project director of SAFAR Gufran Beig told PTI. The wind direction is important from the point of view of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, which falls in the northest region. Wind blowing from that direction brings pollutant-laden smoke to Delhi. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee's (DPCC) real-time readings displayed a downward trend cutting across its monitoring stations. The city's pollution hotspot Anand Vihar had a PM 10 reading of 1640 micrograms per cubic metre at 4 am. It came down to 580 by 5 pm while PM 2.5 was at 145 micrograms per cubic metre. At Punjabi Bagh, PM 10 came down to 214 micrograms per cubic metre at 5 PM from a high of 1270 recorded at 10 am. Other stations like Mandir Marg and RK Puram displayed similar trends. PM 2.5 and PM 10 are ultrafine particulates, the dominant pollutants in Delhi, which has recently been described as a ""gas chamber"" by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. The 24-hour prescribed standards of PM 2.5 and PM 10 are 60 and 100 respectively and prolonged exposure to anything beyond that harms the respiratory system and may cause cardiac complications.

Delhi Environment Minister Imran Hussain wrote to his Union counterpart Anil Dave urging him to instruct the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to undertake the scientific investigation. His letter came on a day neighbouring Haryana and Punjab rejected the city government's argument that biomass burning in their states was largely responsible for the capital's foul air and alarming levels of smog. ""...satellite imagery from NASA shows large scale crop burning and pollution from the industries of nearby states like Punjab and Haryana, which have tremendous amounts of pollution. ""In this scenario, it is imperative that the source of emissions and their respective pollutant load contribution is investigated for the entire NCR,"" Hussain wrote. This, he said, will ensure that states ""own up"" to their responsibilities. Union Environment Minister Anil Dave today urged all the political parties to stop playing blame game. ""There must not be blame game here. Right now the priority is to make air pollution free so that the people can breathe. We will issue an environment protection calendar which will be state specific. Dust is one of the major reasons for pollution,"" Dave told ANI. Early this year, a team led by IIT-Kanpur Professor Mukesh Sharma had submitted a report titled 'Comprehensive Study on Air Pollution and Green House Gases (GHGs) in Delhi'. The widely quoted report had put the contribution of biomass burning in pollution within the city (during winters) at 17 per cent (for PM 10) and 26 per cent (for PM 2.5). PM 2.5 and PM 10 are ultrafine respirable pollutants that are harmful to the respiratory system and can lead to cardiac issues in human beings. Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal today said that the state has no role in environment pollution in Delhi. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi has ""miserably failed"" on all fronts and now they were trying to shift the onus of their non performance on others, he said while refuting charges that stubble burning in Punjab is one of the reason for pollution in Delhi.

Skymet Director Mahesh Palawat said strong winds from Punjab and Haryana will push the pollution away. ""Due to adverse weather condition like slow wind speed, high humidity and low temperature, pollutants are hanging close to the surface. However, strong winds of about 15-20 kmph are expected from the northwest in next 24-48 hours, which will help in fast dispersal of pollutants from the air,"" Palawat said. ""On Tuesday morning, people may find mist due to low temperature. However, pollution level will go down and visibility will increase later in the day."" Thick smog have shrouded Delhi since last Sunday as levels of particulate matter - PM 2.5 and PM 10 - shot up to the maximum level of 500 across the national capital due to fire crackers, stubble burning in neighbouring states, dust from construction activities and vehicular traffic. Palawat added that air quality will improve further if strong winds continue for several more days, due to change in pressure in the Bay of Bengal. The development may cause rains in Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, and increase in pollution levels in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, he said. He also noted that stubble burning by farmers in the neighbouring states, which has added heavily to the current pollution scenario, will be over in next few days, which will stop further addition of pollutants in the air. Palawat called the plan of artificial rains ""infeasible"" saying ""there are no clouds to carry it out"".

Doctors and experts say that besides spike in fresh cases, health complications have aggravated in people having a history of asthma, allergy or other related ailments. ""Earlier 15-20 per cent pollution-related ailment cases were reported at our hospital. But now these have gone up to 60 per cent. ""The most common problem is related to respiration. But this time we are seeing a rather large number of cases of severe breathlessness, coughing and sneezing and bronchiolitis due to the smog,"" says Dr S P Byotra, senior consultant and chairman of the department of medicine at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH). Bronchiolitis is inflammation of the bronchioles, the smallest air passages of the lungs. ""Children and elderly are the most vulnerable to infections and allergies due to smog and pollution. So, they should take extra care, and try not to venture during early morning and at dusk when the toxic level is highest,"" Byotra says. A thick shroud of menacing grey haze blanketed the national capital yesterday even as pollution level breached the safe limit by over 17 times at places, prompting Chief Minister Arvind Kerjriwal to also describe Delhi as a ""gas chamber"". Kejriwal cited smoke from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana as the main reason for pollution. He appealed to people to minimise the use of private vehicles in view of the situation and switch to public transportation facilities. The Chief Minister has called for an emergency cabinet meeting at noon today. Kejriwal met Environment Minister Anil Dave yesterday and sought Centre's urgent intervention to deal with the challenge. Dave termed it an ""emergency situation"" and called a meeting of environment ministers of all neighbouring states tomorrow to curb stubble burning by farmers. ""There is an emergency situation in Delhi. The situation is bad, particularly for children, patients, women and elderly. We need to take immediate steps to deal with the situation,"" Dave told reporters, adding he was also exploring the possbility to call a meeting of chief ministers of all neighbouring states on the issue. According to experts, it is estimated that over 20 per cent of the world's population suffers from allergic diseases such as allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis, atopic eczema and anaphylaxis. ""We are seeing a rise of 60-70 per cent in ailment cases related to pollution. Breathlessness, asthma, eye and skin allergies case have jumped. We are getting patients as young as a two-month-old baby who had bronchiolitis. ""People who had a history of or are predisposed to such ailments, such cases have also risen. Children getting affected more, as their immunological state is low. Besides, the infections are taking longer time to subside,"" says Dr Rahul Nagpal, Director and Head, Pediatrics, at Fortis Hospital in Vasant Kunj. ""Children should as far as possible avoid venturing out in the open early morning and late evening, and peak hours of the pollution. The number of cases have increased due to the smog in the last few days,"" says Dr V K Paul, pediatrician at AIIMS. Cases of asthma and allergy have also doubled at Apollo Hospital in south Delhi, with doctors saying cases of coughing, sneezing, and eye and skin allergy on the rise in the wake of thick smog that has engulfed the city for past few days. ""The incidences have surely risen, and in many ailments it has doubled almost. Asthma, allergy and other ailments triggered by pollution have increased and it is the elderly, who are suffering the most,"" consultant (internal medicine) at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Dr Suranjit Chatterjee says. ""Vehicular pollution is a major factor and it is my view that private vehicles should be limited and people should take up public transport more. The vehicles should have compliance with international green norms, but more than that we need sustained efforts to address this issue,"" Chatterjee says. Nearly 17,000 schools running under the three municipal corporations of Delhi were yesterday closed in view of the heavy smog and pollution. Asthma is a worldwide problem, with estimated 300 million affected individuals and global prevalence which ranges from 1-18 per cent in different geographical regions. Air pollution is killing nearly eight lakh people annually in the South East Asian Region with India alone accounting for over 75 per cent of the casualties caused by cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer, according to WHO. According to a recent WHO report, a few Indian cities, including Delhi, Patna and Gwalior were identified as among the severely polluted cities in the world. Experts say global warming and pollution are among the major factors responsible for causing allergic ailments.

About 10 lakh students are enrolled in these schools administered by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) and the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC). He further said that the Sanitary Inspector and the Assistant Sanitary Inspector concerned will be held responsible for burning of garbage at 'dhalaos' (covered space for storing garbage). ""We have ensured that one responsible employee remains present at each dhalao. The SDMC is striving hard to impose ban on burning of garbage. In case any employee of the Corporation is found burning garbage strict action will be taken against him,"" he said. Arya also appealed to the citizens, social organisations and RWAs to come forward to curb the rising pollution. ""It may be mentioned that as per the National Green Tribunal's orders to take action against burning and throwing of garbage in open, the Corporation has instructed for imposition of Rs 5,000 fine,"" Arya said. The Corporation has also issued instructions to teachers and students to avoid outside activities in the coming days, in view of the rising pollution levels. ""The schools have also been instructed to hold prayers inside the classrooms and not in the ground.

Delhi's air quality deteriorated to alarming levels and witnessed its worst smog situation in 17 years on Wednesday and Thursday. On Wednesday, the levels were 9.4 times the standard norms. However, as per official data, the air quality of Delhi and Gurgaon 'luckily' improved yesterday, as light wind from Rajasthan helped disperse the smog and particle pollutants in the air. The Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi improved from 432, labelled 'severe' on Thursday and Wednesday, to 372 labelled 'very poor' on Friday. The AQI of Gurgaon also improved from 454 on Thursday to 263 on Friday. The AQI of Faridabad worsened further from 427 on Thursday to an alarming 453 on Friday. As per weather experts, low wind speed and local emissions could be the reasons for that. According to data from the Indian Meteorological Department and private weather forecaster Skymet, wind speed on Friday was 8-10 km per hour, while on Thursday and Wednesday it was nil. Due to this, besides some other factors, the smog in Delhi brought down the air quality to alarming levels. Experts have suggested the ailing persons to stay indoors and cautioned people to avoid outdoor exercises for a few days. The Central government on Friday asked the states to strictly enforce the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)'s 42-point order issued last year in December. The order contains short, medium and long-term measures to control pollution by curbing crop burning, open garbage burning, among others.

Admitting that the enforcement of rules for tackling air pollution was weak, the Ministry said that crop burning has been controlled in almost all neighbouring states of Delhi except in Punjab where large scale burning has been reported. At today’s review meeting with secretaries of NCR states here, Union Environment Secretary AN Jha said that Punjab has assured that it will make efforts to check the crop burning. ""Stubble burning has been controlled to a large extent in most of the states except in Punjab where there have been instances of stubble burning on a large scale between the last few days of October and first few days of this month. However, the Punjab government has assured us that they will make all efforts to check them. There are certain medium and long term measures to wean away the farmers from burning the crop. We have taken them on board and we shall be pursuing them in terms of making funds available to them and through schemes,"" Jha said. In December last year, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had instructed states on 42 points (to tackle air pollution). There were short, medium and long term measures. After issuing these orders, five or six meetings have already been held at the ministerial as well as CPCB level. Many steps have been taken. ""There are many areas where much more needs to be done. Special focus needs to be given on enforcement of these orders. Because enforcement mechanism is still weak, states have been asked to make enforcement stricter and take whatever steps which needs to be taken,"" Jha said. Jha said various issues related to air pollution, including crop burning, dust pollution, pollution from landfill sites, building construction, vehicular pollution, industrial pollution were discussed during the meeting. ""Delhi government has been asked to regulate and check the fly ash which is coming out of the Badarpur plant. We will also issue orders to NTPC so that while transportation whatever fly ash is going into the atmosphere, it stops. Delhi government has also assured us that it will immediately come out with an plan of action to utilise the money available with it from the collection of environmental tax and one per cent cess for steps to improve the environment,"" Jha said. He said although various steps have been taken separately by states, ""much more"" needs to be taken and all the states have agreed on the ""seriousness"" of the problem. Jha said around Delhi, all states have agreed to review and check pollution arising out of brick kilns and the ministry has also asked states to take immediate action against them. ""Those brick kilns which are functioning on old technology, instructions have been given to states to check and review them and possible shut them down if they are polluting,"" he said. Among other instructions, states, especially Delhi, has been asked to check, monitor and review all the check points where PUC certificates are given to vehicles as to how many vehicles are coming in and getting certificates by the state traffic police and transport department. He said that cleaning of roads is another focus area where states have been asked to take measures. He said the CPCB will check the 17 critically polluting industries in the NCR region and see whether they are following norms while it will also monitor if diesel generator (DG) set guidelines are being followed or not. The CPCB chairman will review these measures with states every month so that the air quality of the national capital improves. Meanwhile, MCD schools will remain closed tomorrow as thick blanket of smog continues to cover the national capital.

The green court also asked them to immediately enforce a ban on diesel vehicles more than 10 years old from plying on roads in the national capital. Air pollution continues to be severe in Delhi with visibility on Thursday dropping to the second lowest recorded in at least 10 years for November. On Thursday morning, the city's air quality index again went off the scale at 500+, a level it had reached a day after Diwali. The Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government informed the NGT that the high air pollution the capital is witnessing is due to crop burning in Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan. The NGT had earlier ordered to phase out diesel vehicles more than 15 years old to bring down air pollution in Delhi, rated among the dirtiest capitals in the world. In an affidavit filed on July 29, the Ministry of Heavy Industries told the NGT that its orders were in “contravention” of the Motor Vehicle Act. “At present no legal provisions exist under which diesel vehicles that are more than 15 years old and are BS-I or BS-II compliant could be scrapped,” it said. Earlier this year, a division bench of the Delhi high court had directed Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to ensure that crop stubble is not burnt in the states. Although the states have failed to implement the court’s order, no further measures have been taken.

News agency IANS, however, quoting experts reported that the smog that enveloped the national capital on Wednesday was worse in the last 17 years. On Thursday morning, the city's air quality index had again gone off the scale at 500+, a level it had reached a day after Diwali. At the Safdarjung area, the visibility was 50m at 5.30am, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) data. “We checked November data of the last 10 years and found that only once had visibility fallen below 50m (on November 20, 2011),” Ravinder Vishen, head, Regional Weather Forecasting Centre, said. Also several schools in the city and neighbouring towns suspended classes and outdoor activities. The IMD also showed that visibility at Safdarjung and Palam on Thursday between 11.30 a.m. and 2.30 p.m. was 400 and 500 metres respectively due to smog. Based on the IMD data, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) experts pitched for emergency steps to save people from respiratory and heart diseases. The emergency steps, they suggested, includes staying indoors. “The government should aggressively advise people to stay indoors and avoid outdoor exercises. At the same time, it should roll out stringent winter pollution control from all sources along with emergency action,” Anumita Roychowdhury, head of CSE's air pollution division, said. As per the experts, unending burning of paddy stubble in Punjab, Harayana and Uttar Pradesh, low winds and pollution during Diwali and other sources of pollution along with weather-related factors led to such abnormal levels of smog. As per meteorological scientists, there was virtually no wind in the vertical column, which is expected to persist for a few more days. ""Satellite images from National Aeronautics and Space Administration's fire mapper have showed that paddy burning in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have increased after Diwali. The images clearly revealed that after October 30, crop residue burning in these states became more aggressive, which contributed to the severe smog in the national capital,"" the CSE said. On Wednesday, Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport recorded the worst smog in 17 years with visibility as low as 300-400 metres. Data from Delhi Pollution Control Committee shows that the levels of PM2.5 (particulate matters with diameter less than 2.5 mm) have increased by 62.7 per cent on November 2 as compared with that on Diwali. On November 2, the levels were 9.4 times the standard norms. Urging the central government to intervene as it would take several state governments to work together, experts suggest the ailing persons to stay indoors and cautioned people to avoid outdoor exercises for a few days. ""Delhi needs an effective winter pollution mitigation plan that can make a difference. Without strong action, smog is only expected to get worse this winter at serious public health costs,"" Roychowdhury added. Meanwhile, the Centre has called a meeting with Delhi's neighbouring states today to discuss the national capital's deteriorating air quality. The Secretary of Union Ministry of Environment, AN Jha, will be meeting the Secretaries of neighbouring states -- Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab -- of the national capital, the government said on Thursday in a statement.

The tribunal also ordered the Chief Secretary to file a status report before it by tomorrow. According to global air pollution data, air quality in Delhi was among the world's worst and between 40 per cent and 100 per cent worse in five north Indian cities than at the same time the preceding year. Even four days after Diwali, Delhi-NCR resembled a ‘gas chamber’ as it came under a thick cover of pollutant-laden smog of scary proportions, forcing the residents to inhale severe quality air. Residents of Delhi complained about irritation in eyes, cough and other discomfort due to the plunging level of air quality. System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) showed levels of PM (particulate matter) 2.5 and PM 10 exceeding 500 at most locations early in the morning. Values above 500 are considered beyond the Air Quality Index (AQI). The US Embassy's air pollution monitor, which covers the area of Chanakyapuri, showed PM 2.5 levels touching 1,000. Calling the air quality hazardous, the US Embassy website issued an alert saying everyone may experience more serious health effects. Dipankar Saha, a scientist working with Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), said that the high level of pollution is due to weather conditions. ""While we should stop all activities which contribute to pollution, there is no need to create panic. We need good weather conditions after which air quality will improve,"" he said. Saha added that rising humidity levels are a major factor responsible for bad air quality. ""During early morning when humidity level is high, PM levels are above 500. But during the day time, they hover around 250-300,"" he added.

The reasons for this degradation have been attributed to smoke due to firecrackers and negligible wind speed to disperse the pollutants. According to System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the air quality index in Delhi toady touched the 500 mark, marked severe. “The wind speed is zero, so is vertical wind speed. And the bursting of cracker, apart from vehicle pollution and that from power plants added to it,” Vivek Chattopadhyay a member of Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said. The next three days is forecast to be just as severe in the national capital, SAFAR added. Mumbai, however, showed a ‘good to moderate’ an air quality index, well under 200. Meanwhile, the Delhi government has announced a raft of measures to curb the rising the level of air pollution in the city. Vacuum cleaning and sprinkling of water on arterial roads, cutting dust from construction sites and prohibiting burning of leaves are among measures that will be put in practice to check the level of pollution in next few days. After a lengthy meeting with concerned departments on Tuesday, Deputy CM Manish Sisodia also said government has drawn up a roadmap to tackle air pollution under which emission control device to cut toxic pollutants at the landfill sites as well as in crematoriums will also be installed. Figures recorded by air quality monitoring agencies showed that bursting of crackers in large quantities on Diwali night (October 30) took the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi and surrounding areas to a ‘severe’ level. A thick layer of smog covered several parts of the National Capital Region (NCR), which affected visibility as well. Experts termed this year's pollution more hazardous owing to adverse factors, like slow wind speed and moisture in the air, which actually obstruct dispersion of suspended pollutants.

Delhiites, who were turning up for work after a long weekend, witnessed smoke-filled skies, ‘severely’ polluted air which has been termed as the season's worst. The volume of ultrafine respirable pollutants -- PM 2.5 and PM 10 -- shot up to alarming highs in the wee hours today, in line with the prediction of the Centre's Pune-based SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research). But, Delhi is not the only city with dangerous level of air quality. A new report from UNICEF says that nearly 2 billion children in the world are breathing toxic air and about a one-third of them live in northern India and neighbouring countries. Counting 2 billion children breathing unhealthy air — out of a total 2.26 billion world population of children — means the vast majority are being exposed to levels of pollution considered by the WHO to be unsafe. Of that global total, 300 million kids are exposed to pollution levels more than six times higher than standards set by the World Health Organization, including 220 million in South Asia. The toxic air put the children at serious health risks including damage to their lungs, brains and other organs. ""The impact is commensurately shocking,"" with 600,000 children younger than 5 across the world dying every year from air pollution-related diseases, UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake said in the report released Monday. ""Millions more suffer from respiratory diseases that diminish their resilience and affect their physical and cognitive development. Out of that 2 billion breathing toxic air, the report puts 620 million of them in South Asia — mostly northern India. Another 520 million children are breathing toxic air in Africa, and 450 million in East Asia, mainly China, according to the report, which combined satellite images of pollution and ground data with demographic patterns to determine which populations fell into the highest risk areas. Since being identified as one of the world's most polluted cities in recent years, New Delhi has tried to clean its air. It has barred cargo trucks from city streets, required drivers to buy newer cars that meet higher emissions standards and carried out several weeks of experimental traffic control, limiting the number of cars on the road. But other pollution sources, including construction dust and cooking fires fueled by wood or kerosene, continue unabated. Delhi's air pollution, among the world's worst, spikes every winter because of the season's weak winds and countless garbage fires set alight to help people stay warm. ""My eyes are irritated, I'm coughing and I find it difficult to breathe,"" said 18-year-old Delhi student Dharmendra, who uses only one name as is common in India. Because of the pollution, ""I don't go out so much nowadays."" Delhi residents were advised to stay indoors on Monday, with health warnings issued for the young, elderly and those with respiratory or heart conditions. Officials said the high pollution levels were made worse by the ongoing burning of spent crops in agricultural fields in the neighboring states of Punjab and Haryana. ""Pollution levels every winter gallop, and we are already beginning to see the signs of it,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director of the Centre for Science and Environment, a Delhi-based research and lobbying organization. Some local studies indicate up to a third of Delhi's children have impaired lung function and respiratory diseases like asthma, she said. ""This really signals health disaster."" Children face much higher health risks from air pollution than adults. Children breathe twice as quickly, taking in more air in relation to their body weight, while their brains and immune systems are still developing and vulnerable.

Using this mobile application, residents of Delhi can help fight air pollution by reporting incidences of leaf and garbage burning, and dust generated by construction activities. EPCA has been appointed by the Supreme Court to improve the air quality in Delhi. The app aims at inclusive participation of citizens in reporting incidences of leaf and garbage burning, building and construction dust and unpaved road dust, and thereby makes them part of the city’s fight to curb air pollution,"" Bhure Lal, chairperson of EPCA said. The mobile application designed by EPCA, along with the municipal corporations and departments concerned of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments also include a section for officials, to resolve cases and upload evidence about what has been done, including a copy of the challan. The app is currently focused on incidences of pollution through construction activities, garbage burning and maintenance of roads, but has the scope to include other pollution-linked violations. The application will generate weekly reports on the status of the cases and action taken, which will be sent to the officials of the Central and state pollution control boards and municipalities. Also, EPCA will analyse this information to submit its report to the Supreme Court on actions taken in compliance with its orders. ""The app is expected to act as an accountability, public information dissemination and public engagement mechanism,"" said Sunita Narain, member, EPCA and director general CSE. The mobile application is also designed to filter out false complaints by creating a reputation system similar to what is used in online product ratings. Each complaint is geo-referenced and will provide the time and location where the evidence of violation has been collected and submitted. EPCA will forward the complaint to the official in-charge, identified through the location and also type of violation. The app has been made publicly available on iOS and Android application stores, and is expected to play an active role in increasing public engagement and accountability in reducing pollution during the winter season this year.

Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) records for October 2015 show that the Air Quality Index (AQI) for nine days ranged between 300 and 400 -- categorised as ""very poor"" -- and at few stations even crossed 400, considered ""severe"". In October 2016 so far, however, the air quality has remained ""poor"" and occasionally ""moderate"", with maximum AQI at 293 on October 4 and 285 on October 18. The ""poor"" category leads to breathing discomfort and ""very poor"" to illness. Experts attribute the marginally better air quality to a combination of factors such as a drop in the influx of trucks, dryness, rise in temperature, winds, low growth in automobile sales and a slight drop in open burning of agricultural residue in neighbouring states like Haryana and Punjab. ""We don't have exact numbers, but the number of trucks entering Delhi has dropped from 50,000-60,000 per day in October 2015 to currently about 30,000 per day after the Environment Communication Charge (ECC) was imposed in Delhi,"" Usman Nasim, a researcher with the Centre for Science & Environment (CSE), told a news agency. The Supreme Court in November last year imposed an ECC of Rs 700 to Rs 1,300 on commercial diesel vehicles entering Delhi. A month later, the apex court doubled the amount. The dryness in air and rise in temperature in October this year is also believed to have helped in reducing the air pollutant concentration in Delhi, making it convenient for winds to carry those away. While the particles in air were the major reason behind poor air quality this year, Nitrogen Oxide and Ozone also affected air quality, especially on Wednesday, October 19 - the eighth day of consistently poor air quality. AQI is calculated based on both particle and gaseous pollutants in the air, including PM10 and PM2.5 (particles with diameter less than 10 and 2.5 micro metre), NO2, SO2, NH3, lead, CO and O3. PMs are the pollutants responsible for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, while Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and others cause lung diseases, lung tissue damage, reduction of lung function and eye-related issues. ""Due to low humidity, concentration of the pollutants is low, as horizontal and vertical winds can easily carry them away,"" Vivek Chattopadhyay, air quality expert at CSE said. Temperature records for October suggest that the temperature in Delhi has gradually increased. The maximum ranged from 36 to 33 degree Celsius in 2012, 39 to 33 degrees in 2014, 38.4 to 35 degrees in 2015 and 37.2 to 32 degrees so far in 2016. Similarly, the minimum temperature recorded was 24 degree Celsius (upper limit) in 2012 and 2013, 26 degrees in 2014 and 2015, and 28 degrees in 2016 so far. The open stubble burning, according to some experts, was a bit controlled this year, though Polash Mukherjee, a research associate at CSE, said that the ""strictness is only on paper"". ""Last year there were at least 15,000-odd fires detected in Punjab and Haryana from mid-October till mid-November. This year burning began from October start and is still going on at an alarming level,"" Mukherjee said. According to him, fewer number of trucks entering the city and an overall slowdown in car sales growth due to speculation of a diesel vehicle ban are the causes for the slight improvement in air quality this year. As winter approaches, the concentration of pollutants in air increases because atmospheric boundary layers come closer to land. ""Winters are the testing period for all the claims of pollution control. About 30 per cent respiratory problems increase. There are more stroke problems and related deaths,"" Chattopadhyay said. A recent World Bank report said 1.5 million people died in India and 1.6 million in China due to air pollution in 2013. ""Many countries like China have developed an Energy Response System, under which all the emitting factories are shut, schemes like odd-even are imposed, bus services are upgraded and schools are shut when air quality becomes alarming,"" Chattopadhyay said, adding that Delhi too needs such measures. In October 2015, two stations reported AQI to be ""severe"", threatening even the healthy people, while it remained ""moderate"" on two days and ""satisfactory"" on one day. ""Satisfactory"" and ""moderate"" indices were however short-spanned and based only on one out of seven monitoring stations. In October 2016 so far, AQI has remained ""poor"" on 15 days and ""moderate"" on four days.

Across the globe, one out of every nine deaths was the result of air pollution-related conditions in 2012, the WHO report states. Of these deaths, more than three million were attributable solely to outdoor air pollution. This WHO report released on Tuesday was based on data collected from more than 3,000 sites across the world. Fresh data in a report from the UN’s global health body “is enough to make all of us extremely concerned,” said Maria Neira, the head of the WHO’s department of public health and environment. Poorer countries have much dirtier air than the developed world, according to the report, but pollution “affects practically all countries in the world and all parts of society,” Neira said in a statement. “It is a public health emergency,” she said. “Fast action to tackle air pollution can’t come soon enough,” she added, urging governments to cut the number of vehicles on the road, improve waste management and promote clean cooking fuel. According to WHO experts, the problem is most acute in cities, but air in rural areas is worse than many think. The data focuses on dangerous particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometres, or PM2.5, as per report. Toxins like sulfate and black carbon are included in PM2.5, which can penetrate deep into the lungs or cardiovascular system. These include deaths from conditions such as lung cancer and stroke. Air with more than 10 microgrammes per cubic metre of PM2.5 on an annual average basis is considered substandard. In some regions satellite data has been complemented by ground-level PM2.5 measurements, but in much of the developing world ground readings remain unavailable, forcing the WHO to rely on cruder estimates, report added. Despite these data gaps, Neira said the UN agency now had more information than ever about pollutants in the planet’s air. Using both satellite and ground measurements “is a big step forward towards even more confident estimates of the huge global burden”, of dirty air, she added. Data is more solid for outdoor pollution, which is blamed for more than three million fatalities annually. But indoor pollution can be equally as harmful, especially in poorer developing world homes where cooking often involves burning charcoal. Nearly 90-percent of air pollution-related deaths occur in low and middle income countries, the WHO said. China, Malaysia and Vietnam — are the most affected regions, the data showed. Using a different data set, the WHO reported in May that 80 per cent of the world’s city dwellers breathe poor quality air, a figure that rose to 98 per cent in poorer countries. The report results in calling for dramatic action against pollution that is blamed for more than six million deaths a year.

According to researchers, there are a large number of toxic nanoparticles found inside the human brain, the same type of particles found in polluted air. The study, led by Barbara Maher from Lancaster University, found that people living in areas with high levels of pollution in the air, have abundant amounts of toxic nanoparticles in their brain. The research team examined the brain tissue of 37 individuals which had lived in air polluted hotspots like Mexico City or Manchester. With the use of microscopic and spectroscopic psychoanalysis, the team came to the conclusion that some petite magnetic components from air pollution packed in the brains, which eventually caused mental problems like Alzheimer. As per study, the tiny magnetic particles located in the human brain are a strongly magnetic, poisonous, mineral, and concerned in the creation of hasty oxygen species including free radicals in the human brain. These particles are allied with neurodegenerative issues like Alzheimer. This is for the first time that such detection has been made. ”The first thing we did was to make ultra-thin sections of tissue, and we analyzed that using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, a very highly resolved microscope, in Glasgow. We were able to examine those thin sections to identify if these particles were in the cells, their shape, size, and size distribution, and critically also conduct chemical analysis in the microscope to determine that these particles were magnetite,” said Barbara Maher.

""Whether the disease becomes manifest and when this occurs is not only due to lifestyle or genetic factors, but also due to traffic-related air pollution,"" said Professor Annette Peters from Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen - German Research Centre for Environmental Health, located in Neuherberg, in Germany. For the study, published in the journal Diabetes, The researchers analysed data of nearly 3,000 participants of the KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Region Augsburg conducted in Germany between 2006-2008) study who live in the city of Augsburg and two adjacent rural counties. All individuals were interviewed and physically examined. Furthermore, the researchers took fasting blood samples, in which they determined various markers for insulin resistance and inflammation. Non-diabetic individuals underwent an oral glucose tolerance test to detect whether their glucose metabolism was impaired. The researchers compared these data with the concentrations of air pollutants at the place of residence of the participants, which they estimated using predictive models based on repeated measurements at 20 sites (for particle measurements) and at 40 sites (for nitrogen dioxide measurements) in the city and in the rural counties. ""The results revealed that people who already have an impaired glucose metabolism, so-called pre-diabetic individuals, are particularly vulnerable to the effects of air pollution,"" lead author of the study Kathrin Wolf from Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen said. ""In these individuals, the association between increases in their blood marker levels and increases in air pollutant concentrations is particularly significant!

In 2013, air pollution claimed 1.4 million lives in India, out of which 9.2 lakh people lost their because of the household air pollution and 5.9 lakh due to the ambient air pollution. On the other hand, China, which is the world's most populous country, witnessed 1.6 million deaths, out of which 8.2 lakh people died due to the household air pollution and 9.1 lakh people because of the ambient air pollution. The World Bank report shows that more than five million deaths worldwide were attributed to health conditions caused by air pollution. About 60 pc of them were in the world’s two most populous countries, China and India. As per report released by the World Bank and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, premature deaths due to air pollution cost the global economy $5.1 trillion annually, hampering the economic development of the countries, particularly growing economies in Asia. As per GDP is concerned, it was found that in 2013 that China lost nearly 10 per cent of its GDP, India over 7 per cent, and Sri Lanka and Cambodia about 8 per cent. “The health risk posed by air pollution is the greatest in developing countries,” said the report. “In 2013 about 93 per cent of deaths and non-fatal illnesses attributed to air pollution worldwide occurred in these countries, where 90 pc of the population was exposed to dangerous levels of air pollution.” Raising alarm about air pollution which is a major environmental health risk, World Bank report said, “It is the fourth leading cause of premature deaths worldwide after metabolic risks, dietary risks and tobacco smoke.

Washable cloth masks are widely used in India and other Asian for personal protection against airborne particulate matter. ""Wearing cloth masks reduced the exposure to some extent,"" but ""the most commonly used cloth mask products perform poorly when compared to alternative options available on the market,"" said the study by scientists at University of Massachusetts Amherst. ""What became clear to us is that millions of people probably wear these masks and feel safer, but we worry that this is potentially making things worse, if they stand next to a diesel truck and think they are protected by the mask, for example,"" said one of the researchers Richard Peltier. In a series of experiments with an experimental mannequin in Nepal, the researchers tested four masks -- one pleated surgical type, two cloth and one cone-shaped cloth with exhalation flaps. They tested for several variables and effectiveness in filtering out five different synthetic aerosol particle sizes plus three particle sizes of diluted whole diesel exhaust, which simulated real-world conditions. Among the cloth masks, the one with exhaust valves performed fairly well, removing 80-90 percent of synthetic particles and about 57 per cent of diesel exhaust. Plain cloth masks were ""only marginally beneficial"" they said, in protecting people from particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers, often considered more harmful than larger particles because they can penetrate the lungs more deeply. ""Unfortunately, the least effective two mask types are also inexpensive, reusable and are widely used in developing countries, implying they are a popular consumer choice where pollution mitigation is warranted,"" the authors noted. Peltier said this study has implications well beyond Nepal, because these masks are very common in China and India, and across much of southeast and southwest Asia. ""This study shows that people should know there is a limit to protection you can get from these cloth masks, but also that something is better than nothing,"" Kabindra Shakya, who was part of the research team, pointed out.

The findings showed that air pollution increased the chances of developing membranous nephropathy -- an immune disorder of the kidneys -- that can lead to kidney failure. Long-term exposure to high levels of particulate matter (PM 2.5) was associated with an increased risk of membranous nephropathy. Previous studies have showed that increased exposure to air pollution may raise respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. To examine how particulate matter in the air is affecting kidney health, a team analysed data on kidney biopsies taken over 11 years from 71,151 patients from 938 hospitals in 282 cities across China, encompassing all age groups. The areas with high levels of fine particulate air pollution had the highest rates of membranous nephropathy. On average, the likelihood of developing membranous nephropathy increased 13 per cent annually over the 11-year study period. ""Our primary finding is that the frequency of membranous nephropathy has doubled over the last decade in China. We show that the increase corresponds closely with the regional distribution of particulate air pollution,"" said lead author Fan Fan Hou of China's Southern Medical University. The results, which appear in an upcoming issue of the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (JASN), calls for attention on the role of air pollution in the development of kidney disease in urban areas, the researchers concluded.

The findings showed that about a third (29.2 per cent) of global disability such as loss of vision and/or speech, paralysis and confusion, is linked to air pollution (including environmental air pollution and household air pollution). 
 
This is especially high in developing countries -- 33.7 per cent vs 10.2 per cent in developed countries, the researchers said.
 
From 1990 to 2013, stroke associated with environmental air pollution showed an increase by over 33 per cent worldwide. However, second-hand smoke saw a decrease by 31 per cent between the same period. 
 
""A striking finding of our study is the unexpectedly high proportion of stroke burden attributable to environmental air pollution, especially in developing countries,"" said lead author Valery L Feigin, Professor at Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand. 
 
Also, over 90 per cent of the global burden of stroke was caused by modifiable risk factors and 74 per cent of them are behavioural risk factors such as smoking, poor diet and low physical activity. 
 
""Controlling these risk factors could prevent about three-quarters of strokes worldwide,"" Feigin added.
 
Further, air pollution, environmental risks, tobacco smoke, high blood pressure and dietary risks were the other risk factors found for stroke in developing countries compared to developed countries.
 
Household air pollution was found to be an important risk factor for stroke in central, eastern and western sub-Saharan Africa as well as south Asia.
 
Every year, approximately 15 million people worldwide suffer a stroke. High blood pressure, diet low in fruit, high body mass index (BMI), diet high in sodium, smoking, diet low in vegetables, environmental air pollution, household pollution from solid fuels, diet low in whole grains and high blood sugar were found as the ten major risk factors for stroke. ""Our findings are important for helping national governments and international agencies to develop and prioritise public health programmes and policies,"" Feigin noted.
 
For the study, published in The Lancet Neurology journal, the team used data from the Global Burden of Disease Study to estimate the disease burden of stroke associated with 17 risk factors in 188 countries between 1990-2013. 
 
""Air pollution is not just a problem in big cities, but is also a global problem. It is one aspect of the fossil fuel and global warming problem, which is itself partly a result of westernisation and urbanisation, especially in India and China,"" the researchers concluded.

According to the findings, 98 percent of the low-income countries are among poor air quality countries. The report was a outcome of the data collected from 795 cities in 67 countries between 2008 and 2013. Various surveys have revealed that every year over 3 million premature deaths take place due to various health problems caused by air pollution. About the WHO report, S.P. Byotra, who heads the medicine department at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital here, said: ""Giving the level of pollution people are exposed in metros, breathing in a healthy air, at least when they are in their homes, may help reduce the chances of getting into these air pollution related health issues."" According to the experts, high levels of air pollution is not just leading to an increase in the respiratory diseases, like poor lung function, asthma and allergies, but also other health problems like obesity, lung cancer, poor foetal development and increased cases of miscarriage. Byotra also said that installation of air purifiers can be an easy way to prevent respiratory problems caused by indoor air pollution. Doctors said that air purifiers are becoming more reliable for people in cities because pollutants released indoors were 1,000 times more likely to reach the lungs than pollutants released outdoors. Vijay Kannan, India head of purifier manufacturer Blueair, said: ""Apart from people with poor respiratory health, children and elderly, people with other common diseases are also opting for air purifiers.. even pregnant women are getting air purifiers installed in their homes because of the latest findings on various health hazards of air pollution and rising awareness.""

But the wait is over now. According to the Hindustan Times report,from this year May, a start-up canadian company Vitality Air,  based in Edmonton in the western province of Alberta is all set to start the sale of canned bottle of air in India at the price of Rs 12.50 per breath. A Canadian company selling air bottled, made much of headlines in Canada in 2015 after it launched its product in China as it had huge demand among Chinese customers. That air is made available in 3-litre and 8-litre cans, with twin-packs costing between Rs 1,450 and Rs 2,800. How they collect the air is a “trade secret” but it’s a “giant vacuum” process. “We suck up all the air in Banff, about 150,000 litres every time and it takes about 40 hours,” Lam said. He’s confident Indians may be in the market for clean, crisp Canadian air. “The pollution in India is more than in China, we expect it to be our largest market.” “The pollution in India is more than in China, we expect it to be our largest market.” said Vitality Air’s founder Moses Lam to a leading daily. He is very much certain about the sale of canned air in India as the condition of air pollution in India is very critical. “It started as a novelty back in the summer of last year. There were forest fires in Calgary and with all the smoke, people started using our product.” Lam added,. Lam said. he came up with the business idea  after listing a bag of ziplocked air on eBay, which sold for 99 cents.""We wanted to do something fun and disruptive so we decided to see if we could sell air."" At the same time, people from China started buying the canned air online and many even gave suggestions that what worked for smoke could apply to smog. With this it was noticed that a distributor in China and now covers seven cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, and has shipped nearly 12,000 pieces to that country. The canned air product comes in two flavours Banff and Lake Louise and the can consists of compressed air which is breathed in through a mask.

Justin Dhaliwal from Vancouver is the one who is going to look after India operations.

706,IndiaTV News,https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/world-delhi-s-air-pollution-rose-23-during-second-odd-even-phase-326809,Delhi’s air pollution rose 23% during second odd-even phase,"Published : May 01, 2016 11:54 IST, Updated : May 01, 2016 12:03 IST","Air pollution levels in Delhi rose 23% during the second phase of the odd-even registration rule,  from April 15 to April 29, over the previous 14 days (April 1 to April 14), based on an analysis of PM (particulate matter) 2.5 data, generated by IndiaSpend’s #Breathe air-quality monitoring devices. The odd-even scheme ends today, April 30, 2016, the data indicating that it likely cannot work in the long term without additional action, such as improving bus services, curbing factory and truck emissions and suppressing construction dust–which accounts for about half of Delhi’s air pollution. Wind speed and temperature also affect air quality. The average PM 2.5 concentration in Delhi’s air was 68.98 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³) during the odd-even period, from April 15 to April 29, indicating “moderate” conditions, which increased from 56.17µg/m³, indicating “average” air quality between April 1 and April 14.
 
Similarly, average PM 10 concentration before the odd-even period was 110.04 µg/m³ (April 1 to April 15), rising 22% into the odd-even phase to 134.39µg/m³ (April 15 to April 29), indicating ‘moderate’ air quality. During the odd-even period, 7 am was the worst hour in Delhi, based on hourly averages between April 15 and April 29, with PM 2.5 levels indicating “poor” air-quality levels of 124.3μg/m3, a 31% increase (94.67μg/m3) in the hourly average recorded at the same time before the rule was implemented from April 1 to April 14.
 
Evening 5 pm was the best hour for Delhi during the odd-even phase, with PM 2.5 levels at 21μg/m3, indicating “good” air quality. Similarly, the PM 10 levels during 7 am were as high as 243.967μg/m3, indicating “moderate” conditions, which cause respiratory illness on prolonged exposure. These levels rose 36% from 179.7 µg/m³ at 7 am, based on hourly averages of the 15 days preceding the odd-even period.
 
Mornings recorded the worst air pollution in four Indian cities—Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai–based on analysis of PM 2.5 data, IndiaSpend reported recently.
 
Getting a reliable picture of air pollution is inherently difficult due to Delhi’s changing weather conditions and constantly shifting patterns of emissions throughout the day, week, and year, IndiaSpend had reported. Moreover, some of the most important pollution sources lie outside the National Capital Region.
 
Particulate matter, or PM, is the term for particles found in the air, including dust, dirt, soot, smoke, and liquid droplets. These are classified according to their diameter. Particles less than 2.5 µm (micrometres) are called PM 2.5. They are approximately 1/30th the average width of a human hair. Particles between 2.5 to 10 µm in diameter are called PM 10. PM 10 and PM 2.5 include inhalable particles that are small enough to penetrate the thoracic region of the respiratory system. The health effects of inhalable PM are well documented, caused by exposure over both the short-term (hours, days) and long-term (months, years). They include: Respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity such as aggravation of asthma, respiratory symptoms, and an increase in hospital admissions; and mortality from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and from lung cancer. Outdoor air pollution causes 670,000 deaths annually in India, according to this 2014 research paper from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.
 
The second phase of odd-even reported fewer violators—5,814 during the first 10 days, as compared to the first phase (6,768). Violators were fined Rs 2000.
 
Vehicles per 1,000 people in Delhi have increased 92% over the past 16 years, as bus and ridership declined, according to Delhi’s Economic Survey 2014-15.
 
Daily passenger ridership on Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses declined 11% in 2014-15 over the previous year, and the number of buses has declined 24% over the past five years, from 6,204 in 2010-11 to 4,712 in 2014-15, IndiaSpend reported. Boosting bus services, we also observed, is key to sustaining the odd-even system.
 
Delhi was reported to have more than 8.8 million motor vehicles as on March 31, 2015, registering an increase of more than 6% over the previous year.
 
Two-wheelers (motor cycles and scooters) reported a growth of over 7% in 2014-15, followed by taxis (6%) and cars and jeeps (6%). The use of other passenger vehicles, such as tractors, fell.
 
Delhi’s transport sector produces six times as much greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) as that of Kolkata’s, five times as much as Ahmedabad’s and three times as much as Greater Mumbai and Chennai, IndiaSpend had reported earlier.
 
Heavy vehicles are major sources of PM 10 and oxides of Nitrogen (NOx). Trucks are leading polluters, contributing 46% of PM 10 and 38% of NOx; light commercial vehicles contribute 28% of PM 10 levels and 13% of NOx, as IndiaSpend reported previously. Mexico City started this rule as Hoy no Circula scheme (No Circulating Day) in 1989. The trial implementation during the winter months of 1989 resulted in a 20% reduction in daily vehicles in circulation within the target area, an increase in vehicle speeds, drop in fuel consumption and 6.6% increase in subway ridership.
 
Initially, the scheme reduced pollution 11%. But, once the rule became permanent, people purchased more vehicles with alternate plates. There was no improvement in long-term air quality levels during any hour of the day or the week. Pollutions levels increased during the weekends and hours of the day when the rule did not apply.
 
In Paris, similar restrictions were imposed for one day in 1997 and in March 2014. The experiment reduced pollution levels. Beijing implemented a temporary scheme before the 2008 Summer Olympics, cleaning the air and relieving traffic congestion.
 
In Sao Paulo, the scheme was initially implemented in 1995, as an emergency measure to curb air pollution. An experimental trial of six month showed 2% (morning) and 5% (evening) reduction in peak-period vehicular volumes. The initial experiment was successful in reducing pollution levels, especially carbon monoxide. The odd-even scheme known as Rodizio, was made permanent in 1997.

About 1.6 million people died of air pollution in China and 1.4 million died in India in 2013, the researchers said. The international team of researchers from India, China, Canada and the US estimated that despite efforts to limit future emissions, the number of premature deaths linked to air pollution will climb over the next two decades unless more aggressive targets are set. The findings were presented on Friday at the 2016 annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Washington, DC. ""Air pollution is the fourth highest risk factor for death globally and by far the leading environmental risk factor for disease,"" said Michael Brauer, professor at University of British Columbia's School of Population and Public Health in Vancouver, Canada. ""Reducing air pollution is an incredibly efficient way to improve the health of a population,"" Brauer noted. Power plants, industrial manufacturing, vehicle exhaust and burning coal and wood all release small particles into the air that are dangerous to a person's health. In India, a major contributor to poor air quality is the practice of burning wood, dung and similar sources of biomass for cooking and heating. Millions of families, among the poorest in India, are regularly exposed to high levels of particulate matter in their own homes. ""India needs a three-pronged mitigation approach to address industrial coal burning, open burning for agriculture, and household air pollution sources,"" Chandra Venkataraman, professor at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, in Mumbai, India, said. In China, burning coal is the biggest contributor to poor air quality. Outdoor air pollution from coal alone caused an estimated 366,000 deaths in China in 2013, Qiao Ma, a doctoral student at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, noted. Ma also calculated the expected number of premature deaths in China in the future if the country meets its current targets to restrict coal combustion and emissions through a combination of energy policies and pollution controls. She found that air pollution will cause anywhere from 990,000 to 1.3 million premature deaths in 2030 unless even more ambitious targets are introduced. ""Our study highlights the urgent need for even more aggressive strategies to reduce emissions from coal and from other sectors,"" Ma said TOP NEWS Uttarakhand people wanted UCC to be implemented: Pushkar Singh Dhami | EXCLUSIVE Akshay Kumar sells apartment in Mumbai for Rs 4.25 crore on nearly 80 per cent profit IND vs ENG: England make one change to their line-up for second T20I in Chennai LATEST NEWS Akshay Kumar sells apartment in Mumbai for Rs 4.25 crore on nearly 80 per cent profit Madhya Pradesh: Mohan Yadav Cabinet approves liquor ban in 17 religious cities in major announcement Elgar case: Activists Rona Wilson, Sudhir Dhawale released from jail Uttarakhand people want to implement UCC in the state, says Pushkar Singh Dhami | Exclusive © 2009-2025 Independent News Service.

Transport Minister Gopal Rai has said that the government will make the announcement after reviewing over 11 lakh responses received from the public through multiple channels on Wednesday. ""Delhi government will take a decision on the future of odd-even tomorrow. The public feedback report is being prepared today,"" Rai tweeted earlier. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia suggested that the licence plate policy will be back ""once again"" while sources said that its next phase could be enforced in April after the CBSE Board examinations. The road rationing experiment, aimed at curbing air pollution in the metropolis, was implemented from January 1-15 in its first phase with Sundays being exempted from it. Subsequently, the government invited public opinion through emails, missed calls, online forms and also reached out to around 9 lakh people through interactive voice response system. ""Around 28,300 suggestions have been received through online forms while another 9,000 and 1,82,808 have come through emails and missed called respectively.

The Supreme Court had on December 16 forbade diesel automobiles with above 2,000cc engines from being registered till March 31, 2016. The decision came in view of the increasing levels of air pollution in New Delhi. The ban has somewhat affected the sales of sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and multi-utility vehicles (MUV), but manufacturers are preparing themselves in case the duration of prohibition is extended in the national capital or extends to other Indian cities as well. ""Very clearly, it has impacted us in the first quarter -- particularly Innova and Fortuner. The National Capital Region (NCR) accounts for 8-10 percent of our volume, but for dealers, the profitability is 50-60 percent,"" N. Raja, Toyota Kirloskar Motor director for sales, told IANS. The Land Cruiser is another vehicle Toyota sells in India, which is also above the 2000cc but the SUV does not account for majority of its sales. ""Frankly our preparedness is towards getting petrol options as Plan B,"" said Raja. ""We have engine options available, but it will not catch up with the launch dates, currently planned around mid-year. It will take further time."" Another option, he said, would be to bring down engine displacement to below 2,000 cc. Out of some 3 million domestic sales of passengers cars in India annually, analysts pointed out that some 7 percent is accounted for by the national capital -- which makes it a market of 210,000 units. Out of that, diesel vehicles account for 25 percent, or a market of 52,500 units. That is 1.75 percent of passenger vehicles sold in India are accounted for by the diesel versions in Delhi region. While this, in itself, may seem small, the anxiety is over the future course of action. Yet, at the ongoing Auto Expo here, the SUVs and Muvs segment had a fair share of new launches. Like the new Innova Crysta, which is set to hit the showrooms by mid-2016. What about the the new entrant in the Indian market, the iconic American SUV maker Jeep vis-a-vis the court order? A senior official of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, which owns Jeep, told IANS that the Italian-American company has enough ability to overcome such issues. ""We are looking at petrol engines for our Jeep in India. Jeep has got enough capacity to take care of these legislations -- in the sense that vehicles which can be brought in at a short notice. We've already responded by looking at a 3.6-litre petrol engine,"" said the source. Jeep unveiled three SUVs here, including the Wrangler, and is looking at cars later this year. ""Whether it (the ban) is in Delhi, or implemented in other cities, we are ready for it. We have not started selling vehicles in the first place but whenever we do and the legislation is there, we are ready to do what it takes,"" added the source. Embroiled in a global emission scandal, German automaker Volkswagen gave a similar response. ""It is not something I would like to comment on simply because it isn't my primary domain. But I'll say this: As a group when you look at the depth we have in terms of technology, different choices of power and so on, it is probably one of the best range of options than anybody can have,"" Volkswagen Motorsport India head Sirish Vissa told IANS. ""So whatever happens, I am sure that we have got enough depth and options we will find that will work.""

The average density of PM2.5, airborne particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter, in Beijing last year declined by 6.2 percent year on year, statistics with the Beijing Environment Protection Bureau show. Beijing aims for a year-on-year drop of five percent in its average PM2.5 reading in 2016. The city government has promised to remove 200,000 high-emission vehicles from the roads and promote the use of clean energy in 400 villages this year. In December last year, Beijing had twice issued its red alert for air pollution. The city government had limit vehicles on roads, banned fireworks and outdoor barbecue as an emergency response to heavy pollution. Citizens were advised to reduce outdoor activities and kindergartens, primary and middle schools were expected to suspend classes during the alert. Beijing issued its first ever red alert for air pollution on December 7, when PM 2.5 reached the top of the scale at 500.

The gains of the January 1-15 odd-even scheme have been lost, and pollution levels can worsen further unless the authorities act, it said in a statement. ""New analysis by the CSE shows air pollution is back with a vengeance. The first three working days after the completion of the odd-even scheme have seen rapid worsening of air quality -- more than 57 percent jump in PM 2.5 levels on the first working day, and has stayed at severe levels."" The Delhi government enforced the odd-even scheme to restrict traffic on the roads, with odd-numbered four wheelers allowed to ply on odd dates and even-numbered vehicles on even dates. ""This validates the importance of emergency action,"" said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director of CSE. ""The fortnight when the programme was implemented has clearly demonstrated that the peak pollution levels are lower than the normal smog peaks of the season -- despite adverse weather conditions."" Experts say that during winter, pollutants in the air stay close to the ground and get trapped in the air. Without an emergency action plan, the delayed winter can lead to rapid building up of pollution levels, CSE said. ""The odd-even scheme has proved that the city needs curbs on high traffic volume to pull down peaking of pollution, reduce congestion that further increase emissions. The Delhi government should expedite action for more systemic solutions,"" it said. Directives from the Supreme Court to control pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR) like advancement of Euro VI emission standards, augmentation of public transport, notice on closure of Badarpur power plant, and action on construction and road dust must be taken, CSE said.

712,IndiaTV News,https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/pinpoint-the-source-to-cut-down-delhi-air-pollution-57148.html,"To cut down Delhi's air pollution, pinpoint the source","Published : Jan 20, 2016 17:37 IST, Updated : Jan 20, 2016 18:16 IST","This winter, Delhi's government and the judiciary have implemented several policies aimed at cutting Delhi's air pollution. The just-concluded odd-even scheme in the city required motorists to find alternative means of transportation every other day. Car-free days, first in Gurgaon and then in Delhi, appeared to cause a temporary dip in pollution levels. The night hours when trucks can pass through Delhi have been reduced, and the National Green Tribunal has issued a direction to lower truck traffic coming into the city at night by levying an additional entrance fee. On some days the air may be clearer. But what remains hazy is where Delhi's air pollution comes from. Over the years, multiple attempts to find out called source apportionment studies have yielded contradictory results. There are numerous suspects: cars and trucks, smokestacks, farm fires in Punjab and Haryana, and dust from construction sites to name just a few. Without a better knowledge of the portion contributed by different sources, any policy response, no matter how bold, will be a little like a blind attempt to pin the tail on the donkey. But that may be changing. The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur has now released a major study, commissioned by the Delhi environment department in 2011. This promises to give the clearest picture of source apportionment yet. And other new sources of quality information on air pollution are appearing: the government has plans to add 10 new air quality monitoring stations in Delhi, and news outlets are setting up their own monitoring systems, including IndiaSpend #Breathe. This could be a turning point in our understanding of the sources of Delhi's deadly air, as well as our ability to craft smart policies that shut them down. We at Evidence for Policy Design (EPoD) are researchers who assist government ministries in formulating such responses. We think that at a time like this a critical convergence of public concern, policymaker attention, and academic contribution it's worth taking stock of what we know now and how we came to know it. That clarity will make it easier to guide the discussion toward a policy response that will stick. Search out the source There are two ways of conducting source apportionment studies: direct sampling based on chemical analysis, and secondary data analysis based on monitoring data. International best practice is to rely on receptor-based studies, but where budgetary constraints inhibit adequate sampling, analysis using secondary data may dominate. Over the past 10 years and excluding the just completed IIT Kanpur Study, we count 15 source apportionment studies that sought to pinpoint the sources of emissions and their respective contributions to Delhi's overall air pollution. Ten are based on direct sampling; the other five rely on secondary data. While the main sources identified are similar across studies, the relative weights placed on different sources by these studies vary dramatically. This underscores both the difficulty of conducting them and the wide range in quality of the studies currently available. Getting a reliable picture of air pollution is inherently difficult due to Delhi's changing weather conditions and constantly shifting patterns of emissions throughout the day, week, and year. Moreover, some of the most important pollution sources lie outside the National Capital Region. This makes it important that direct air sampling studies are broad enough to capture multiple sources and take samples at several different time points. An inability to do this largely due to budgetary considerations and the resulting differences in what gets sampled are an important part of the explanation for the large differences across studies. In such situations, secondary data-based analysis may well be the best option for source apportionment studies, as long as these secondary sources are reliable and span relevant emission sources. Right now, we lack a measure of whether that is the case. Without standardised best practices about which secondary data sources to use and which model to use, source apportionment studies will continue to give conflicting results going forward. So we not only lack the best information on pollution, we also lack consensus on how to determine the second best. In tomorrow's continuation of this article, we will describe how findings from the new IIT Kanpur study fit into that data hierarchy, and the other information systems needed to create a policy response that will clear Delhi's deadly air. Delhi is at a crossroads in its approach to air pollution. Since the capital topped the World Health Organization's list of most-polluted cities, the public has focused its attention on the issue and the government has responded with ever-stronger measures. Now the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur has released a long-awaited study that attempts to identify the sources of air pollution and inform the next wave of policies. We at Evidence for Policy Design (EPoD) are engaged with government ministries in formulating and testing those policies. Yesterday, we described existing source apportionment studies research that attempts to identify where Delhi's air pollution comes from, be it exhaust from vehicles, smoke from fires, or dust from construction sites. These studies have had widely divergent results, in part because we lack a consensus on how to weigh different types of evidence. Comprehensive guidelines for source apportionment studies in India do not exist. The new IIT-Kanpur study improves on previous attempts by taking seasonal variation in pollution into account, showing that vehicles are a much bigger contributor to air pollution in the winter than in the summer. The study also documents a broad range of sources like garbage burning, dust, and crop burning to paint a more complete picture of what's causing air pollution in Delhi. This study marks a good time for India's regulators to implement a plan to commission these types of studies at regular intervals, using a regular set of metrics to track how pollution changes as the government intensifies its response. Fine-grained data for a smart response Source apportionment studies, even when done well, are not enough. They need to be complemented by a network of air quality monitors that offer a picture of air pollution in real-time, allowing citizens to protect themselves during periods of high pollution and helping policymakers target the most polluted areas of the city. The backbone of Delhi's air quality monitoring network is its set of 21 ambient air monitoring stations, 11 of which have data that are accessible to the public. The city's main air pollution concern is PM2.5, suspended particles small enough to be trapped in the lungs. PM2.5 has been shown to cause lung cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, asthma, and a host of other health problems. Data obtained from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) website for the 11 monitors run by the CPCB and Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) show that PM2.5 was being recorded only 29% of the time at these sites last winter the season associated with the most severe levels of particulate pollution. Coverage since March 2015 has increased to 46%, but these gaps in the data make it difficult to reliably characterise the actual air quality situation in the city. Continuing the trend of improvement in coverage should be a high priority. Coverage patterns show that monitor downtime tends to be concentrated in long stretches, when PM2.5 is not being collected for several months. This could be due to maintenance issues that are not detected or acted upon in a timely manner, pointing to problems with information flows and management within the organisations running the monitors. Paradoxically, these large gaps in data collection may be easier for the CPCB and DPCC to address than if monitors went down more frequently and for shorter periods. Making air pollution monitoring data easier for the public to access would be a good step toward creating the accountability that could help these organisations keep the city's monitors functioning. For the quality of air to improve, the quality of information must first rise. With even a rough idea of source apportionment, the government can take actions like shutting down dirty power plants and pushing neighbouring states to better regulate crop-burning. Once the low-hanging fruit is picked, policymakers will need increasingly detailed information on location, source, and type of air pollution to design a smart policy response. Now is the time to get the information systems in place that will inform the next decade of environmental policy in the city, and beyond.

""Every official sitting on every chair will have to do their job,"" a bench of justices Badar Durrez Ahmed and Sanjeev Sachdeva observed when Delhi government senior standing counsel Rahul Mehra said it cannot take action against the bureaucrats as such a step would be declared null and void by the Centre. ""If a particular officer is not functioning or complying with our directions, bring it to our notice and we will take care of it,"" the bench said. Mehra submitted that the official earlier appointed to assist the court on the matter has gone on a two-month leave and no one else was willing to take his place. ""What do you mean not willing? If an officer does not listen, throw them out,"" the bench said and added that if an official is not going to work, ""let him resign"". The government told the court that S S Gill, Special Secretary of the Department of Urban Development, would take up the job. The bench further noted that due to ""decades of laxity (in implementing the law), we are suffering today"". Both the Centre and the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi came under heavy fire from the High Court which reprimanded them for not being interested in taking concrete steps with regard to air pollution. ""They are only interested in taking steps for public consumption. No one seems to be keen on implementing the law. “Each government is at the other's neck,"" it said. The High Court further lambasted the Delhi government and the Centre, saying ""if you cannot govern, tell the people that you cannot govern. Do we tell you that we cannot deliver judgements due to some compulsion? If you do not comply with our orders, we would be compelled to take recourse to Contempt of Court Act and then you cry hoarse against the same.."" It also said the ""judiciary was not interested in getting brownie points. We are not contesting elections. We are not going to ask people for votes. We want law and justice to prevail. However, when we do this, there are news reports which say courts are over active."" The court further directed the Delhi government, its concerned departments and other concerned authorities to nominate officials who would ensure that its orders are complied with.

According to Ramesh Singh, a professor at Chapman University in California, the odd-even rule being implemented in New Delhi is unlikely to have any major impact on Delhi's air quality due to its geographical location and the long-range airmass floating in from north and northwestern India. “The odd-even restrictions will be of great help in reducing the traffic but wouldn't do much to reduce concentrations of fine particles,” he told IANS in Varanasi. ""My views are supported by data from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite,"" said Singh, who was formerly a professor of civil engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur. According to Singh, Aerosol Optical Depth, which is a measure of air pollution, retrieved from MODIS satellite data over Delhi during December 1, 2015, to January 10, 2016, shows that the pollution level remains high and there is no reduction in PM2.5 fine particles after the odd-even restrictions were put in place. Singh said that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has tried to pick a leaf from Beijing, where some car owners in different areas are allowed to drive only on specific days ""to cut down the flow of traffic, not because of pollution"". ""Delhi and Beijing have similar sources of pollutants (coal-based power plants, brick kilns, industry and the like), but we should not compare whether PM2.5 is higher in Delhi or Beijing because the geographical situation is different,"" Singh said. ""Cities in the Ganges basin have the lofty Himalayas in the background and, again, whereas in Beijing the emissions get dispersed in all directions, in Delhi pollutants come from western parts and occasionally from eastern parts of the basin. ""Delhi is located in the Ganga basin and during winter time, depending upon the weather conditions, dense haze, fog and smog are formed and moves in the Ganga basin. Therefore, sometimes dense fog/haze/smog is seen in Delhi, Kanpur, Lucknow, Banaras and Amritsar. ""Also, during the winter season the wind, which is mainly westerly, brings pollutants from Pakistan, and from Punjab and Haryana, northern regions of India. All these pollutants cannot be stopped due to the towering Himalaya in the north,"" Singh said. Therefore, there is continuous flow of airmass from west to east and Delhi gets affected through the long range transport of pollutants from the west and also from the foothills of the Himalayas where the burning of wood is prevalent during the winter season, Singh said. Emissions from vehicles in Delhi mix with the fine particles in the airmass coming from the western side and the strong mixing of the two affects the solar radiation budget and highly impacts Delhi's atmospheric chemistry, which may create other atmospheric problems, Singh said. ""While the effort of the Delhi government must be welcomed, a detailed feasibility study is needed to manage plying of vehicles in Delhi to curb the local pollution,"" he added.

The increase in PM2.5 level indicates the need to understand deeper the impact of policy changes, such as the odd-even measure, on Delhi's air. Additional factors, such as temperature, wind-speed and increased moisture, could account for the rise in air-pollution levels. It is likely, though, that the odd-even measure introduced by Delhi's Government might not, in itself, be adequate. IndiaSpend earlier reported how additional measures were needed to clean the air of the world's most polluted city. These could include the closure or upgrade of obsolete power plants, restricting trucks (as the Supreme Court has ordered) and two-wheelers and suppressing construction and road dust. IndiaSpend's analysis is based on weekly average data recorded by six #Breathe devices across Delhi at Sarvodaya Enclave, India Habitat Centre, Munirka, Nizamuddin East, Connaught Place and Chanakyapuri. Average PM 2.5 concentration in Delhi's air was 361.3 micrograms per cubic metre (g/m) during week 2 (from January 1 to January 7, 2016, after the introduction of the odd-even measure) giving it a 'severe' rating, according to the guidelines of the Central Pollution Control Bureau (CPCB). This kind of air can affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases. PM 2.5 concentration in Delhi's air was much lower at 240.1 g/m during week 1 (December 25 to December 31, 2015), prior to the introduction of odd-even rule. PM 2.5 are fine particulate matter found in the air with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less and are known to pose the greatest risk to human beings. Their measurement is considered to be the best indicator of the health risks from air pollution, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). On average, daily PM 2.5 concentration levels have been above 250 g/m on every day of week 2, attaining a 'severe' rating. Week 1 witnessed average daily PM 2.5 concentration reaching 'severe' levels on three days, with 'very poor' air quality (151 to 250 g/m) over the other four days. This could lead to respiratory illness on prolonged exposure. The increase in average PM 2.5 concentration levels from week 1 to week 2 has also been visible in data released by sensors of the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), an advocacy. To illustrate this, we compared average daily PM 2.5 concentration data generated by our #Breathe sensor at Connaught Place with one installed by the DPCC in the same vicinity. PM 10 (particles between 2.5 to 10 m in diameter) during week 2 recorded 'severe' ratings for seven days, and 'very poor' for one day. Week 1 did not record any day with 'severe' rating. Instead, our sensors recorded 'very poor' air quality over three days and 'poor' (PM 2.5 concentration between 91 to 150 g/m) over four days. A 'poor' rating implies breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. How did the odd-even measure work during morning and evening rush hours? The hourly average PM 2.5 level between 9 am and 10 am, recorded by our sensor at Chanakyapuri for Monday, week 1, was 283 g/m. For Monday, week 2, after the enforcement of the odd-even rule, PM 2.5 levels rose 60% to 450 g/m. The hourly average of PM 2.5 levels between 6 pm and 7 pm doubled from week 1 to week 2. As we said, additional factors, such as temperature, wind-speed and increased moisture, could account for the rise in air-pollution levels. The graphs below show how wind-speed and humidity varied over the period under consideration. (Indiaspend.org is a data-driven, public-interest journalism non-profit).

Monitoring stations of Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology recorded suspended particulate matters multiple times above the safe limits. A Western disturbance, active over North India, is keeping moisture levels high and wind speed calm, thereby aggravating the situation as pollutants are not getting dispersed, Anumita Roychowdhury of Centre for Science and Environment explained. But Delhi government, which is comparing the prevailing data with 2014 figures during the same period, maintained that there was a ""definitive declining trend"" in the levels of Particulate Matter (PM 2.5), the tiniest and deadliest of all the microscopic particles. The corresponding period in 2015 had experienced cleaner air due to rainfall, a DPCC scientist said. Average levels of PM 2.5 and PM 10 were around 250 and 422 micrograms per cubic metre on Tuesday, as opposed to the safe limits of 60 and 100. Real time data of several DPCC stations had PM 2.5 and PM 10 above 300 and 800 micrograms per cubic metre respectively. SAFAR's hourly average graph remained above the 'severe' threshold through the day. In 13 of the 20 locations where a mobile monitoring van collected samples on Monday, PM 2.5 level was recorded at less than 300, ""which proves reduction in comparison to previous years at the same time by at least 100 units"", the government said. According to scientists of the DPCC, 80 per cent of PM 2.5 air pollution is caused by vehicular traffic and reduction in its levels, even in outer areas of Delhi shows that reduction of cars is having a ""positive impact"". Roychowdhury, who heads the clean air project of CSE said, 67 per cent of the days in December had PM 2.5 in the worst category, meaning 'severe', as per the National Air Quality Index. ""The levels not only crossed 250 micrograms per cubic metre but went beyond that. Measures like odd-even are meant to pull down the peak levels,"" she said. Green body TERI has also warned against an immediate assessment of the impact of the odd-even scheme that came into force on January 1 without considering the impact of sources other than emissions from cars.

The hourly update of System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR) showed an upward trend of PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentration since morning. At 1 pm, PM 2.5 was at 241 micrograms per cubic metre. Monitoring stations of Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) at Anand Vihar and RK Puram had PM 2.5 at 563 and 590 micrograms per cubic metre around the same time while PM 10 was 901 and 694.

The safe limits of these harmful micro particles of PM 2.5 and PM 10, that can enter the respiratory system and subsequently the blood stream, are 60 and 100 respectively.

The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), in its analysis, observed that yesterday's pollution levels had severely violated the prescribed limits.

The 24-hourly averaged concentrations at four locations, Mandir Marg, R K Puram, Punjabi Bagh and Anand Vihar, were found to be five times, 5.4 times, and 1.1 times higher than the safe standards respectively, TERI said.

""Analysing the trends between December 24 to January 3, PM 2.5 concentrations have increased by 72-176 per cent at the four stations. However, this is mainly due to reduced wind speeds during the period,"" the green body said.

It said an immediate assessment of the impact of the odd-even scheme that came into force on January 1 was not possible considering the impact of sources other than emissions from cars and meteorological influences.

Goel, the former Delhi BJP chief, said that the present formula will reduce pollution by only “2-4 per cent” and the Delhi government is “not doing anything” about dust, heaps of garbage, trucks entering Delhi from NCR areas and construction sites which “contribute to 43 per cent of total pollution” in the city. “People in Delhi are scared of odd-even scheme and the government should have implemented it after six months of preparation,” he said. The Rajya Sabha MP, who rode a bicycle to pay obeisance at Hanuman temple in Connaught Place, said he chose this mode of transport today to show that the government can control pollution with people's participation. Questioning the success of the odd-even scheme, he said the AAP government will accuse Modi government of working against the scheme if it “fails”. “How can a scheme which is based on such “dishonesty” can succeed?” he questioned. Former senior cop and BJP leader Kiran Bedi too expressed her reservations, saying that the odd-even formula was yet not put to “real” test. “This is not the real test of the plan, because its holiday season. Schools are closed and many people have gone out of the city on holidays. Its first test will be when schools and offices will open after winter holidays,” she said.

As the first day of the 15-day experiment draws to close, the air quality levels in the city do not offer a very reassuring picture. According to the U.S. Embassy and Consulates' air quality monitors that measure airborne fine particulate matter (commonly referred to as PM 2.5) on its compound in Delhi, the Air Quality Index (AQI) measured at 5 pm on January 1 has been categorised as ‘very unhealthy'. The AQI measured by the US Embassy at 5 PM in Delhi today stood at 221. As per the report, the health effects of this category of AQI correspond to “significant aggravation of heart or lung disease and premature mortality in persons with cardiopulmonary disease and the elderly; significant increase in respiratory effects in general population”. The advisory states that “people with heart or lung disease, older adults, and children should avoid all physical activity outdoors” and everyone else should avoid “prolonged or heavy exertion”. While the AQI measured at the US Embassy does portray a grim scenario, especially in the wake of the large-scale programme that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal launched today, it is too early to judge the impact that the odd-even formula will eventually have based on today's data. The winter fog is also a major reason for poor air quality prevailing in and around the national capital, besides other contributors. Another study by the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) had yesterday said that air quality in Delhi was expected to deteriorate over the next few days with a possible rise in the level of particulate matter due to fall in minimum temperature and calm wind movement. SAFAR stations, located in various areas the city, also displayed 'very poor' real-time Air Quality Index. In no marked change from yesterday, the average levels of PM 2.5 was around 180 micrograms per cubic metre, three times above the safe limit of 60. The corresponding safe limit of PM 10 is 100. There are over 84.5 lakh private vehicles in Delhi, which collectively contribute only 9 per cent to air pollution. These vehicles constitute 55 lakh two-wheelers and around 28,75,000 cars. The odd-even formula does not apply to two-wheelers and to cars that belong to the government, VIPs, police, embassies and defence establishments are not covered under the rule. Resultantly, only 5,30,000 cars of the 28,75,000 cars will be off the roads as a result of this formula. In 2015-end, the Delhi High Court had rapped the state government and the Centre on its knuckles for not coming up with a specific plan to tackle rising air pollution levels in the city. “Living in Delhi is like living in a gas chamber,” the court had observed, sending the Delhi government into what critics have termed as a ‘knee-jerk reaction' that has not been looked into in detail. While the implementation of the rule was by and large a success, there were a few violations too. A total of 117 challans were issued to violators till 5 pm today. This included 81 challans by the Traffic Police by 5 pm and 36 challans by the Transport Department by 4 pm today.

Someone who has driven down to office for few years can't easily get used to travelling by metro or public buses instantly.

Rafeeq, a taxi driver, said that his passengers were happy to see less traffic. “The tourists are at ease today. Otherwise they always criticise the traffic system and long jams in Delhi. I have been driving taxi for 15 years and congestion has been a major problem. I believe it is good step by the government,” he said. Advocating exemption for medical professionals under the scheme, a doctor said, “I have two cars which are both odd so that means I work just half a week or I take cabs. Now I cannot predict emergency, the most essential service as far as Delhi is concerned is the medical force and we are not exempted under the scheme.” “I think the idea is good but I will request the Chief Minister to relook at the modalities. A lot of us are in intensive care practice and they should look at it sensitively,” he added.

Transport minister Gopal Rai on Thursday appealed to Delhiites to make the scheme a success as the move will clear the city's polluted air for children, and said despite the alleged ""conspiracy"" by the BJP, it will be ""successful"". Under the scheme, private cars having odd registration numbers will be allowed to ply on odd dates and those with even numbers on even dates. To send a strong message to people, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and his cabinet ministers will carpool to work and use public transport with the start of the odd-even scheme that will restrict movement of private cars on Delhi's roads for 15 days from Friday. Kejriwal will share his car with transport minister Gopal Rai and PWD minister Satyendar Jain while environment minister Imran Hussain and social welfare minister Sandeep Kumar will take an auto and a bus, respectively, to Delhi secretariat. Kejriwal, Jain and Kumar live in North Delhi's Civil Line area. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia will go to work in an odd-numbered car. Tourism minister Kapil Mishra will ride a bike to office. Kejriwal had recently said he and his cabinet ministers will carpool to work and follow the rules of the odd-even scheme. Thousands of civil defence volunteers will be deployed to assist the traffic police, enforcement teams of Delhi government's transport department and authorized sub-divisional magistrates, to implement the scheme which will kick in at 8am on Friday. Besides, pressing into service 3,000 additional buses, the government has issued two helplines - 011-42400400 and 011-41400400 - for people to register their complaints and suggestion in connection with the scheme. 200 teams of Delhi traffic Police, 66 enforcement teams of transport department and 40 teams of sub-divisional magistrates will be deployed from Jan 1 to ensure strict implementation of the scheme. As per the traffic restriction plan, odd-numbered cars will be allowed to run on odd dates while even-numbered vehicles can only ply on even dates. Motorists will have to cough up Rs 2,000 for violating odd-even rules. Delhi Police Commissioner B S Bassi appreciated the Arvind Kejriwal government's ambitious plan and assured ""100 per cent commitment"" in its strict implementation.

Noting that the Delhi government's plan was an effort to confront the city's severe air pollution problems, the embassy in a statement said although vehicles with diplomatic plates are officially exempt from this policy, it will take the measures in support of efforts to reduce air pollution. ""For the duration of the policy, official embassy New Delhi vehicles will comply, to the degree possible, with the odd/even restrictions. ""American employees are strongly encouraged to voluntarily cooperate with the odd/even policy. Many American diplomats will be carpooling or travelling by public transportation,"" the embassy said. It has also advised their supervisors to be flexible regarding transportation-induced delays.

""We direct Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) to hold a meeting within two weeks where Central Pollution Control Board and Indian Railways would be represented."" ""They would deliberate and determine as to what standards have to be provided for emissions for diesel locomotive engines in India as well as indicate the steps that Indian Railways should take to bring the emissions within the prescribed parameters,"" a bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar said. The green panel directed the railways to submit this report to the tribunal within six weeks and posted the matter for next hearing on February 9. During the hearing, the counsel for the railways submitted international standards for emissions from diesel locomotive railway engines and also filed a data sheet indicating the emissions from 30 railway engines. He told the bench that the parameters detected during testing were ""much in excess to international standards"". In November last year, the green bench had directed Ministry of Railways to hold a meeting with IIT, CPCB and Ministry of Petroleum and asked them to collect data and set emission standards to ensure that no pollution is caused from the locomotive engines. The directions came while hearing a petition filed by Dwarka resident S K Goyal about harmful emissions from diesel locomotives.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will announce the blue print of the odd-even scheme tomorrow which aims to prevent rising pollution in the city. “Women drivers will be exempted under the scheme but they will be penalised if any male member is travelling along.  Women drivers travelling only with female members will also not be considered a violation,” sources said. They said that according to the plan, owners of CNG-fitted cars will need to show prescribed stickers.  Violation of the odd-even rule will attract a penalty of Rs 2,000. “Vehicles from other states entering Delhi will also come under the ambit of odd-even scheme. Government has also given an exemption to bikes from its ambitious plan,” they also said. Earlier this month, Kejriwal had announced that he, his ministers and all government officials will follow odd-even scheme. To curb rising pollution level in the national capital, the Delhi government has decided to introduce odd-even scheme to be implemented starting from January 1. A trial of the scheme will run till January 15. According to the government's plan, it will run 6,000 additional buses to accommodate numbers of passengers after the implementation of odd-even scheme.  Nearly 10 lakh private cars will daily stay off Delhi roads once the odd-even formula is enforced with drastic reduction in traffic flow expected to significantly reduce the high-level of pollution in the city. There are over 19 lakh private four-wheelers registered in Delhi and nearly half of these will go off the roads with the implementation of AAP government's ambitious odd-even formula.

Around 10 PM, in three stations of System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), PM 2.5 fell in the severe category which affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases. Delhi Pollution Control Committee's (DPCC) reading of Anand Vihar station, one of the most polluted spots in the city, had PM 2.5 at 534 micrograms per cubic metre at 9.50 PM while PM 10 was at 853. The corresponding safe limits are 60 and 100.Unbelievable as this might sound, a reality check of the air outside 7, RCR revealed a shockingly high level of pollution that poses real threat to the prime minister's health. Mandir Marg and Punjabi Bagh, localities far away from each other, had PM 2.5 levels at 271 and 315 micrograms per cubic metre, nearly 5 times above the safe limit respectively. R K Puram's PM 10 was at a staggering 1135, 10 times above what is considered safe. Central Pollution Control Board's National Air Quality Index was not available and its official website continued to display almost two week figures. Very poor quality air signifies PM 10 and PM 2.5 levels between 351 and 420, and 211 to 252 micro gram per cubic metre while severe is declared when PM 2.5 and PM 10 cross 253, 421 micro gram per cubic metres respectively. PM 2.5, microscopic in size, is considered by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as the best indicator of the level of health risks from air pollution.

A bench of justices Badar Durrez Ahmed and Sanjeev Sachdeva was of the view that while legislations were in place for ensuring maintenance of air quality levels, individuals and departments tasked to enforce the rules, ""have not done their work"". It directed officers of all concerned authorities, including Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), that ""all the rules have to be followed to the 't' as the situation today is of an emergency nature"". ""This situation would not have arisen if all authorities had implemented the rules,"" the court said. The court, referred to particulate matter-PM 2.5 and PM 10-and said as per the statutory norms their levels are not to exceed 60 microgram per cubic meter per day and 100 microgram per cubic meter per day, respectively. However, as per DPCC monitoring stations, their levels are always far in excess of 400/500. It directed DPCC, represented by advocate Sanjeev Ralli, to ""analyse data from 2011 onwards and to provide us a monthly average chart of each pollutant."" Another exercise the panel has been directed to carry out is to give a weekly chart of the pollutants during the months from October to February for all the years from 2011 to 2015. DPCC has also been asked to provide the court with details of action taken by it, against any violations, in the last five years. Meanwhile, on the issue of traffic management to reduce the timings of idling vehicles, the court observed that despite its direction for zero tolerance towards violation of rules, especially by people who jump onto other carriageways to get ahead during traffic snarls, police was doing nothing. ""People in Delhi need to be disciplined. Send anyone who changes carriageways to turnaround and go in the opposite direction from which they came, as they do in Mumbai,"" the bench said while hearing a PIL initiated by it on the issue of increasing air pollution in Delhi. Delhi Traffic Police, in an affidavit, told the court that it had identified 14 areas in the city which were heavily congested and that, in those places, it had observed zero tolerance for violation of rules.

In his letter, Kejriwal apprises the PM of the “unprecedented” and “unpopular” decision that his government has had to take in view of the rising air pollution in the national capital.  

Seeking the PM's cooperation, Kejriwal has also requested the PM to encourage his ministers and secretaries to follow the rules laid out in letter and spirit.

“I, along with my colleagues, will follow the rules in totality and will opt for car-pooling to travel. I request you to encourage all your ministers and secretaries to do the same,” Kejriwal wrote.

“Doing so will send the right message to the people of Delhi and our efforts will get the required support,” he added.

Necessary directive or appeal from the Prime Minister will have a comprehensive impact towards the success of the odd-even formula, Kejriwal further wrote.

Starting January 1, Delhi will implement an odd-even formula under which odd-numbered vehicles would be allowed to run on odd dates and the even-numbered vehicles on the even days.

The plan will be implemented for 15 days in the first phase.

The Delhi government's radical plan comes in wake of the alarming pollution levels in the national capital.

The industry appeared to be of the view that the SC decision isn't optimal and that there was need for a comprehensive view of various factors contributing to the issue to deal with the problem. ""So, even if we believe the decision on diesel vehicles isn't optimal, we'll honour it and develop vehicles that comply with their stipulations,"" Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra tweeted.

""I have always believed that the Supreme Court is an institution that sustains our faith in social justice and democracy in India,"" he added. Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra slumped 5.5 per cent on Wednesday following the apex court's decision.

Sharing similar views, Toyota Kirloskar Motor Vice-Chairman Vikram Kirloskar said: ""There are various sources of pollution which can be measured using a scientific source apportionment study. 

""To improve the air quality from vehicle point of view we must take a comprehensive view of various factors causing pollution.""

German luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz, homegrown Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors-owned JLR are among the worst hit by the SC order as their entire diesel model range is powered by engines above 2,000 cc.

Delhi, along with Mumbai, is the largest market for luxury vehicles in India. According to industry estimates, the capital city accounts for about 20 per cent of total luxury vehicle sales in the country.

Tata Motors' utility vehicle Sumo Gold, SUV Safari and MPV Aria are also affected by the order. German luxury carmaker BMW and rival Audi are likely to face minimum impact of the decision.

Air pollution is responsible for 10,000 to 30,000 deaths annually in Delhi and is the fifth leading cause of death in India, a report by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) released today said. The publication ‘Body Burden 2015: State of India's Health'  also said that climate change is leading to greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The publication, which comprehensively examines the linkage between environment and health, said that a number of public health catastrophes arising out of environmental reasons are staring people of India in the face. “The report has gone into areas such as vehicular pollution, industrial pollution, polluting cook stoves that cause indoor pollution, and related issues. The report states that death toll due to uncontrolled air pollution-related illnesses alone has increased worldwide by a whopping 300 per cent in the last decade. “...from 800,000 in year 2000 to 3.2 million in 2012. In Delhi, which was named as the most polluted city of the world by WHO in 2014, air pollution is responsible for 10,000 to 30,000 annual deaths,” it said. 2) Air pollution levels above prescribed limits in 15 of 17 Indian cities with NAQI stations The report said that Delhi's levels over the eight months of data were 12 times as high as the WHO annual guideline and three times as high as the national standard. Another six cities Lucknow, Faridabad, Ahmedabad, Kanpur and Varanasi -- had average levels at least 10 times as high as the WHO annual guideline, it said. Comparing the situation in China and India, Delhi's PM2.5 levels in July-November were almost twice as high as the levels in Beijing over the same period (132 vs 69 g/m3), and were even higher than the levels in the most polluted provincial capital - Jinan in Shandong, the report said. India, China and the Middle East, with their fast-growing economies and expanding industry, have seen growing air pollution, according to NASA scientists who tracked the trends over the last decade in various regions and 195 cities around the globe. According to the findings, US, Europe and Japan have improved air quality owing to emission control regulations.

We have to keep their convenience in mind,” the Deputy CM added. The move comes as Delhi gears up for the implementation of the scheme on an experiment basis from January 1, 2016. The odd-even rule for vehicles plying on Delhi roads will be tested for a two-week period between January 1 and January 15. Earlier on Thursday, the Delhi government announced a slew of measures to boost public transport capacity. This will include 6,000 more buses, an increase in the availability of auto-rickshaws and the Delhi Metro running at ""peak capacity"" during the test period.

Levels of PM 2.5 and PM 10, pollutants of microscopic sizes, were largely in the ‘very poor' category in Centre's System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) stations. However, few CPCB stations like Anand Vihar, Mandir Marg, Punjabi Bagh and R K Puram had air quality in the ‘severe' category which has the potential to affect healthy people and “seriously impact” those with existing respiratory ailments.  “24-hour average of PM 2.5 was 200 today. Yesterday it was 189 while tomorrow it is expected to touch 210. It is due to influx of pollutants from distant sources, mostly due to the north-easterlies from the Indo-gangetic plains, an area which stretches from Kolkata to Rajasthan,” Chief Project Scientist of SAFAR Gufran Beig told PTI. Beig pointed out that there has been no significant change in PM 10 levels, which are much coarser than PM 2.5 and cannot travel long distances, indicating that the spurt has not been caused by local factors. “Had the rise been due to local conditions, both PM 2.5 and PM 10 would have risen. On top of that there has been no drop in temperature either which also increases concentration of pollutants,” Beig said. Usual highly polluted spots such as Anand Vihar and Punjabi Bagh continued to have pollutants, five to 10 times above the prescribed limits. 541 and 1431 were the real time PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels of Anand Vihar at 7 PM while the corresponding figures were 454 and 182 at Punjabi Bagh. On prolonged exposure to ‘very poor' quality air, which signifies PM 10 and PM 2.5 levels between 351 and 420, and 211 to 252 micro gram per cubic metre respectively one can develop respiratory illness.

Beijing's air this morning turned from ""very unhealthy"" to ""hazardous"" as PM 2.5 - particulate matter with size equal to or less than 2.5 micron and the main gauge to identify pollutant particles in the air - touched 365 compared to yesterday's 256 level. A grey haze hung over the city at a time when crucial climate talks have entered their final phase in Paris. According to the Beijing Municipal Environmental Monitoring Centre, heavy smog will linger until Thursday. It is expected to disperse on Thursday afternoon as a cold front arrives. Under the red alert, the highest in the four-tier emergency response system created in 2013, all schools have been ordered to be closed, and outdoor construction halted. The red alert, Beijing's first ever, was issued yesterday will last from 7 am today to noon on Thursday. Officials have also clamped restrictions on factories and traffic. The reading of the PM 2.5 the Particulate matter in the air at the US Embassy Beijing Air Quality Monitor showed 365 this morning. According to the US embassy classification, anything beyond 300 is categorised 'hazardous', warranting people to take preventive measures like avoiding outdoor exposure. Car use will be limited during the red alert period as cars are allowed on the roads on alternating days depending on the odd or even numbers of their license plates. In addition, 30 per cent of government cars will be banned from streets on an odd/even basis. The restriction of car use is expected to push an extra two million passengers onto public transport per day. Beijing will add 21,000 to 25,000 buses, including 8,182 clean-energy buses, to the roads from today, officials said. Few students showed up at the Beijing No. 2 Experimental Primary School as the school sent out text messages giving them the choice of either staying home or coming to school. He Jinglong, a physical education teacher of the affiliated school of Beijing Jiaotong University, led students in indoor exercise yesterday. ""We designed a set of exercises specially for smoggy weather to keep students fit,"" He was quoted as saying by state-run Xinhua news agency. The Beijing Education Commission issued a notice last night asking all middle, primary schools and kindergartens to suspend classes during the red alert period. The air quality in Beijing in every winter suffers as the city operates dozens of massive coal fired heaters to keep millions of homes warm, but add to the industrial, vehicular pollution besides burning of agricultural waste in the outskirts.

In a one of its kind achievement, Vyachakurahalli village in Karnataka has  become India's first smokeless village. The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has declared the village as 'smokeless' after all the 274 households shifted from firewood to LPG stoves for cooking. In India, especially the rural areas, firewood is the main source of fuel used for cooking. The fuel which creates a lot of smoke, leaving several women at risk of serious health hazards as a consequence. The use of firewood is harmful to the people and the environment as it produces a heavy amount of carbon dioxide when used a fuel. ""My compliments to the residents of Vyachakurahalli which has been declared as the first smokeless village in India,"" Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan tweeted. The Petroleum Ministry conducted an awareness campaign in which they taught the village women how to cook their food using LPG stoves. The women were also told to switch off the regulator every night. Firewood continues to be the most important fuel in many of India's village. The recognition to the village for its use of clean fuel has come as no mean achievement for the villagers. With Vyachakurahalli having taken the lead, it now remains to be seen how many others follow suit.

Delhi's transport minister Gopal Rai while addressing the media said, “The 'odd-even' formula will be applied to vehicles from 8 am- 8 pm"". However, the plan will not be enforced on Sundays.The minister also said that the government will be ready with the final blueprint by 25th Dec. Delhi's Home Minister Satyendra Jain will be the nodal minister who will overlook the whole campaign and will co-ordinate with all the concerned departments. The next meeting is scheduled on 10th of Dec. The minister said that departments will come up with their recommendations on whether two-wheelers will come under ‘Odd- even' traffic rationing or not The coal based power plant in Badarpur will be given notice to shut down within the next seven days. There will be a pollution check at 200 places. DPCC will collect samples to check for pollution levels after the new plan comes into force. The Delhi government announced that it will recruit volunteers to help in sensitising citizens. A high-level meeting, chaired by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, also decided to enforce the restrictions date-wise as even numbered cars will be allowed to ply on even dates and odd-numbered ones will ply on odd dates. After the meeting, participated by all stakeholders including Delhi Police, PWD and Metro, Kejriwal said his government was yet to take a call on whether the scheme will have the two-wheelers on its ambit. Transport Minister Gopal Rai said government will come out with a detailed blueprint by December 25 which will answer all all the questions being raised by experts and public. He said government will soon come out with details of exemptions like those who are ailing and disabled. A decision on whether women will be included in ‘exemption list' is yet to be taken. “The odd-even scheme will be in force from 8 AM-8PM and there will be no restrictions on Sundays,” Rai said.  He said the management of Badarpur thermal power plant, which the government has decided to shut, has been given seven days notice to do so. “The Delhi Metro is working on a plan to increase its operational frequency. We have also decided to bring 1,000 new cluster buses to augment public transport. “We have also decided to involve around 9,000 private buses including those serving schools for ferrying passengers,” Rai said. He said the Delhi Pollution Control Committee will take samples to check air quality from around 200 spots across the city and the results will be put on display boards. The Transport Minister said government will review implementation of the odd-even scheme after January 15.  He said the fine amount to be slapped on violators has not yet been decided. Earlier Satyendra Jain had said that Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and Cluster have been asked to increase the frequency of their buses by 20 per cent. “Besides, Metro will also be asked to increase their working hours so that people don't have to face problem while using public transport. If we increase public transport by 20 per cent, there will be no problem for people,” he also said. On December 4, the AAP government had come out with a plan of restricting private vehicles bearing odd and even registration numbers to alternate days from January 1 in the national capital.

They have suggested  on road rationing echoing arguments that invoking such restrictions, with minor tweaks, are needed in the short term, to put across the message that car users are a ""heavily subsidised"" lot. However, they contended that several other measures in the medium term and long term, towards rapid strengthening of public transportation are needed in order to reach a stable situation and reduction in pollution levels. According to Raj Cherubal, Director-Projects, Chennai City Project, plying of odd and even numbered vehicles every alternate day would lead to a ""dramatic"" decrease in congestion during the peak pollution months. ""Double or triple your bus fleet. Increase your feeder system dramatically to connect to main trunks and Metro. But it's very easy to harp on long-term solutions but if short term measures such as this are not supported then whole point is lost,"" Cherubal, who has pioneered 'car-free' days in Chennai said. He rued that no one calculates and talks about ""actual cost to taxpayer and losses"" due to all the infrastructure given to private cars. ""Real numbers should puncture some of the smugness and entitlement attitude."" Holding it as a step in the ""right direction"", India head of Institute for Transportation and Development Policy Shreya Gadepalli said that the odd-even system had been refined by cities like Bogota. Madhav Pai of EMBARQ seconded Gadepalli's argument. ""At least three cars are required to beat the system that allows only 40 per cent of vehicle on any given weekday in Bogota (vehicle numbers ending with 1,2,3,4 on Monday and so on). A robust IT based enforcement mechanism is required,"" Gadepalli said. Car users will have to realise that they are being subsidised heavily and these measures are needed so that the message percolates down, Pai, who has authored 'Bus Karo' a guidebook on bus operations and planning, said, adding that in Bogota odd-even restrictions are enforced only during peak hours. ""Impose parking surcharge and with that money build and subsidise public transport. But that would need time. Even congestion pricing cost is really high. 40 to 50 per cent cost goes only in running the system. There should be short-term measures with commitment to long-term,"" he said. Cherubal also praised the AAP government for showing ""political leadership"" and giving a ""shock to the system"". He said even if 20 per cent stops using private vehicles, the positive affects would be visible. Cherubal, who is associated with several thinktanks, also stressed on the need for a communication strategy to make people aware of the importance of such measures by softening resistance and introducing people to alternatives. ""Introduce car free days and other such events in all neighborhoods. Make it fun. But idea is not to entertain the public, but to change behaviors,"" he said. The government has been observing car-free days, one day every month, since October,"" he said. Gadepalli of ITDP, which has played a key role in implementing Ahmedabad's bus rapid transit (BRT) system, said the government must increase the bus fleet -- from around 5,000 currently to around 15,000 -- and implement around 600 km of metro-quality BRT. ""Delhi Metro is not enough. Worldwide, buses serve more trips than rail. For example, London's 8,000 buses carry twice as many passengers as its 1,800 km rail system. Government must also charge market rates for parking. It is a commodity, not a right,"" she said. In a radical step to curb alarming air pollution, Delhi Government on December 4 announced its decision to restrict plying of private vehicles bearing odd and even registration numbers to alternate days from January 1 in the national capital.

The Delhi CM today recorded an audio message urging the residents of Delhi to give the 'odd-even' restriction on plying of vehicles a chance. This, even as top officials brainstormed over its modalities. Responding to the Delhi Police's contention that they had not been approached by the government seeking assistance in enforcing the new rules, Delhi Home Minister Satyender Jain  asserted that the police was a part of government and ""not the government"" in itself. “It is police's responsibility to implement the law enacted by the government,” he said. In his message, which will be released tomorrow, Kejriwal has sought the people's for the success of the proposal. The CM has said that the new rules will apply to him as well as his ministers, a senior government official said. Meanwhile, Transport Minister Gopal Rai has said that government will come out with a ""foolproof plan"" before December 25. Jain also told a TV channel that the odd-even formula will not be applicable on two-wheelers running in the national capital, which was later downplayed by the government, saying the details were yet to be worked out. ""The odd-even formula will only be applicable on private cars plying in Delhi. For now, the movement of two-wheelers, taxis, autos will be not be restricted on alternate days under this formula,"" the minister told a tv channel. Kejriwal has called a review meeting with concerned ministers and officials tomorrow wherein the detailed plan will be put before the CM. A preparatory committee chaired by Jain that has prepared a detailed report on the matter met ahead of tomorrow's meet. Jain is also scheduled to meet Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari tomorrow. Meanwhile, a senior official of Delhi Traffic Police said that clarity eluded them regarding the legal provisions under which violators of the odd-even formula will be prosecuted. ""They (the government) are yet to approach us for a reasonable discussion on the scheme, which is imperative for its implementation,"" he said. Delhi's air quality continued to plunge as it entered the 'severe' category in places across the city, with real time readings showing PM 2.5 five times above the prescribed limit at times, which has the potential to affect healthy people and ""seriously impact"" those with existing respiratory ailments.

However, there was a general consensus in the upper house that steps needed to be taken to reduce air pollution in the national capital. ""Half of the cars (in Delhi) will not be on roads. The Delhi transport system capacity is not capable of ferrying so many people,"" Congress member Pramod Tiwari said while raising the issue during Zero Hour. ""It does not consider how patients or their caretakers will reach hospital. How will children reach schools? What about those coming from outstation,"" he asked. ""They are not focusing on public transport and now the situation will be even more difficult. They talk about the common people, but possibly only those with two cars are common people for them,"" the Congress leader said referring to the Delhi government. Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien, however, stressed that something needed to be done to control pollution in the national capital. ""Are we not to do at least something to reduce air pollution? Remember, one of the main reasons for climate change is carbon emission... so something has to be done,"" he said. Delhi MP Karan Singh said drastic steps needed to be taken, but called the Aam Aadmi Party government's decision ""weird"". ""Certainly, something drastic has to be done. But what is going to happen to one-car families? How are they going to get their children to school, go to office? This is a weird suggestion; it should be reconsidered. Other suggestions should be looked at... we will all cooperate,"" he said. Union Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that while the central government favoured reduction in pollution, the solution should be ""practical"". ""It is a Delhi government order... the feeling of Pramod-ji or the house, we feel, is that there should be a reduction in pollution, but it should be practical. We think the members are worried about its practical applicability. But we support that pollution should be reduced,"" he said. The deputy chairman agreed that while the decision could be accepted in theory, its practicality was in question. However, a staunch support for the move came from former environment minister Jairam Ramesh, who called it a ""step forward"". ""In India, there are always 10 problems for every solution. This is one step forward; give it a chance to be tried and it will make drastic change in pollution levels in Delhi. I dissociate myself thoroughly from Pramod Tiwari,"" the Congress leader said.

Kejriwal government has decided to allow private vehicles with even and odd registration numbers to run on alternate days only from January 1,  2016. This decision effectively means that vehicles ending with an even number will ply on a certain day and followed by odd number plates in the next day. However this rule will not apply to public vehicles. Delhi government has also decided to shut down south Delhi's Badarpur power plant. The power plant is coal-based plant run by the NTPC. The government has also decided to move to National Green Tribunal (NGT) to request for closure of Dadri Thermal power plant which falls in the neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh. The decision, taken at a meeting presided over by Kejriwal, will also cover vehicles entering Delhi from other states. The Delhi government hopes to reduce emission by half in the national capital by the controversial move. The sweeping move - like the one taken in Beijing in 2013 - will apply to a large bulk of the some 90 lakh vehicles registered in Delhi, where about 1,500 new vehicles are added every day. Delhi's vehicular population - which cause choking jams on all weekdays - includes some 27 lakh cars. The decisions came a day after the Delhi High Court said that the national capital was like a gas chamber, and sought immediate action from the central and Delhi governments. According to the Central Pollution Control Board, the air quality of Delhi is said to be ""very poor"" with an air quality index of 331. When air quality index ranges between 301 and 400, the air is said to cause respiratory illness on prolonged exposure. Earlier measures apparently have not dented the increasing air pollution in Delhi, leading to major health issues. In October, the National Green Tribunal announced an ""Environment Tax"" or ""Green Tax"" on commercial vehicles entering the city. The Delhi High Court later ordered all private radio taxis to switch over to compressed natural gas (CNG) before March 1, 2016 if they desired to operate in the capital. NGO Greenpeace warned recently that the indoor air in Delhi was five times more polluted than it should be according to Indian standards. The WHO, however, says this is 11 times more than their prescribed level. He said Government will carry out a massive plantation drive along all arterial roads across the city to curb spread of dust and ensure vacuum cleaning of roads by the Public Works Department from April 1. The city government has also decided to make it mandatory for vehicles to have Euro VI standards for vehicular emission from 2017, two years before the Centre's scheduled introduction of the same. Sharma said public transport will be significantly augmented to take the load of increasing passengers due to the odd-even number restrictions. This practice of allowing even-odd numbered vehicles on alternate days is not entirely new as it is already being followed in world cities like Beijing and Singapore. Vehicles entering Central London also follow the same rule. However, the implementation in Delhi may prove to be a tough challenge given the fact that public transport in the national capital is not as efficient and robust as in Beijing, Singapore and central London.

The study, published in the Environmental Science and Technology journal, said that most of the deaths were due to heart attacks and strokes, and many of them were not of respiratory diseases. The study, titled Addressing Global Mortality from Ambient PM 2.5, concluded that 45% of these premature deaths in Delhi could be avoided if the city met the national ambient air quality standard for PM2.5. If the city's air quality is get to the safe standard set by World Health Organization, as much as 85% these deaths could be avoided, the study said. China is another country with worrying air pollution. The study stated, “Major improvements in air quality would be required to substantially reduce mortality from PM2.5 in more polluted regions, such as China and India.” “Forecasted demographic and epidemiological transitions in India and China imply that to keep PM2.5-attributable mortality rates (deaths per 100 000 people per year) constant, average PM2.5 levels would need to decline by ∼20–30% over the next 15 years merely to offset increases in PM2.5-attributable mortality from aging populations,” the study further stated. The annual mean PM2.5 level in Delhi was about 150 micrograms per cubic metre, about four times the national standard and 15 times the WHO guideline, as per the study. The study is authored by Joshua S Apte from the University of Texas, Julian D Marshall from the University of Minnesota, Aaron J Cohen from Health Effects Institute and Michael Brauer from University of British Columbia. An earlier study called the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) had estimated that high levels of PM2.5 particles, which can get lodged in the lungs and enter the bloodstream, were responsible for 3.2 million deaths globally. The current study uses a high-resolution global model to estimate how many deaths can be prevented, and in which parts of the world, using data from the GBD as well as following the methods of the GBD study. The study found that about 1.4 million premature deaths can be avoided in China and India alone if air quality met the WHO guideline.

Around 100 experts from the scientific and the academic communities would discuss threadbare the circumstances that led to the situation and try to formulate short-term as well as long-term policies and solutions in this regard. The report prepared at the end of the day-long meet would be handed over to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar. It is being organised by the the Indian Association for Air Pollution Control (IAAPC). “Delhi has become one of the most polluted cities in the world and is the most polluted city in India. It is having serious effect on the health of the citizens of Delhi. However, despite of all this no concrete and practical action plan has come up to improve the air quality,” the organisers said in a statement. The objective of the meet scheduled to be held on June 20 at the Indian National Science Auditorium here is to initiate a dialogue between the policymakers and members of the scientific community. “Eminent experts including air quality expert prof J M Dave, environmentalist Prof G D Agarwal, Prof Mukesh Sharma, who headed the team that came up with the National Air Quality Index, ecologist C K Varshney are expected to participate in the conclave,” IAAPC said.

It stated that at least one in eight deaths around the globe is related to air pollution menace. According to the latest figures from the WHO, air pollution was responsible for over seven million premature deaths in 2012, one million more than tobacco. It also stated that the number of deaths due to air pollution, which include outdoor as well as indoor pollution, have increased four-fold worldwide since 2005. Globally 4.3 million die each year due to exposure to indoor air pollution and 3.7 million due to exposure to outdoor air pollution. Around 88 per cent of deaths belonged to low- and middle-income countries, and the greatest number in the western Pacific and south-east Asia regions. The 68th World Health Assembly, which concluded in Geneva last week, passed a resolution to address the health impacts of air pollution. It identified 13 measures that member states should implement, including guidelines to limit exposure to air pollution and working with private and public entities on sustainable solutions. A study conducted by WHO last year stated that Delhi is the most polluted city in the world when it comes to air quality, worse than Beijing which had previously held the dubious tag. The 2014 version of the Ambient Air Pollution (AAP) database included results of outdoor air pollution monitoring from almost 1600 cities in 91 countries. It claimed that Delhi has the highest concentration of PM2.5   particulate matters less than 2.5 microns  form of air pollution, which is considered most serious. Latest studies by WHO and other international agencies show that apart from respiratory diseases, exposure to air pollution leads to severe risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancer.

The study claimed that air in the Indian capital is more toxic than that of Beijing. A comparative analysis of the data from the two cities conclude that, according to the US air quality standards, Delhi cleared the ‘healthy' mark only for seven days while Beijing hit the mark 58 times in the last two years. Professor Douw Steyn of the University of British Columbia, an air pollution expert who performed the study, compared the data from the pollution monitoring station at RK Puram in Delhi and the US embassy in Beijing. “Unpolluted (healthy) conditions were found in Delhi for less than 1% of the time while such conditions exist in Beijing approximately for 8% of the time,” Steyn said. The data shows that in Delhi, the level of microfine particles known as PM 2.5, which is considered most dangerous, was above the ‘hazardous' level 17% of the time, or nearly one day in five. At these levels, according to the US definition, “everyone may experience serious health effects”. Whereas in Beijing, only 7% of days reached this catastrophic level, thanks to the air pollution control measures the local authorities have taken in the last few years. Gufran Beig of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), however, expressed doubts over the findings and said that comparing pollution levels at RK Puram with the US embassy in Beijing was not correct because of a huge geographical difference between the two locations. “The US embassy is outside the polluted zone of Beijing and has a lush green area on one side and a big water body on the other, both contributing to pollution sequestration. RK Puram is middle of Delhi and is next to the congested Ring Road without any sequestration zones,” he argued. Steyn used United States air quality index (AQI) which is more stringent than the recently launched Indian air quality index. Indian AQI showed some good air days for Delhi in March. The US index equates air quality of a city on six parameters — moderate, unhealthy for some, unhealthy, very unhealthy and hazardous. In a move to reduce air pollution in the capital, the National Green Tribunal recently ordered to ban diesel vehicles more than 10 years old.

The green panel asked the states to take ambient air quality samples in their areas and submit reports in this regard. The Tribunal has also asked the state governments to come up with suggestions to combat air pollution in the respective states. The Tribunal had earlier stayed for two weeks its order to impound more than 10 year old diesel vehicles, heavy or light, plying in the national capital. On April 7 it had held that all diesel vehicles which were over 10 years will not be permitted to ply in Delhi-NCR. Dismayed at increasing air pollution in the national capital, the Tribunal had banned all vehicles which were more than 15 years old from plying on the city roads.

Taking a serious note of the dust pollution, National Green Tribunal (NGT) on April 9 also ruled that dust emissions from construction sites will be completely controlled by all authorities. ""The government is very serious about the increasing level of dust in the city.

Within next three months, mechanical cleaning of PWD's roads will begin,"" PWD minister Satyender Jain told PTI. As per government officials, around 78 per cent of the pollution is caused by vehicles, out of which 38 per cent pollution is due to dust. By these steps, more than 27 per cent air pollution could be decreased, they said. Jain said, ""Dust remains suspended in the air because of continuous movement of vehicles on the city roads and to adopt a permanent solution for this problem, we have decided to plant grass along roads."" The government also plans to repair all broken footpaths, the minister added. Concerned over increasing air pollution, the NGT recently ordered to ban all diesel-run vehicles which are more than 10 years old.

This is because the city government and the Central government have started blame game for delaying the action to contain growing air pollution. The menace has now become a subject of political wrangling with two sides writing letters accusing each other of ignoring their respective demands. A day after Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar slammed the AAP government in Delhi for not submitting an action plan to contain growing air pollution, the Kejriwal led government on Wednesday sent the Centre a rebuttal. In a letter to Javadekar, a day after the Union Minister exhorted the Delhi government to act against air pollution, Delhi's Environment Minister Asim Ahmed Khan said that an action plan to improve air quality was sent to the Union Ministry in the month of February. He further told Javadekar that in a follow-up to that, the departments concerned, including DDA, MCD, NDMC, Delhi Police, etc., have been requested to prepare time-bound implementation plans. The departments concerned are working on the action points identified for them, Khan added. Javadekar had on Tuesday said Delhi government had assured his Ministry that it would submit an action plan till March 31, but added that it has not received any plans so far. ""It is pertinent to mention that air pollution does not recognise geographical boundaries. At any point, air pollution is caused by several sources, even from long distances. Since the NCR is a contiguous area with high-population density and multiple pollutant sources, it is difficult to pinpoint and isolate the source of pollution in Delhi alone,"" Khan said. According to Delhi government, crop residue burning also contributes to high levels of pollution in Delhi. There are reports about scientific studies which indicate that Delhi is receiving pollution from neighbouring towns and industries present in NCR. Khan requested the Union Minister to convene a meeting of various stakeholders in Delhi-NCR, saying, ""Several towns of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh fall within NCR... May I request you to ask them to set-up joint check posts well within their territories to ensure that overloaded vehicles can be checked and turned back before they enter Delhi."" He also called for these states to prepare an action plan on the lines of the one being drawn up for Delhi. Delhi government also requested the Union Environment Ministry to take up the initiative of coordinating source- specific pollution control activities in the NCR to improve the air quality not only in Delhi, but in the entire area.

This air quality index has rated Delhi's air as polluted enough to earn the dubious distinction of  being world's most polluted city. The air quality index is a global standard based on the national ambient air quality standard. India will be adopting the index at a time when the quality of air in most cities is fast deteriorating in the absence of a national policy to combat rising pollution. While the index will become the basis for state pollution control boards to issue advisories on cities' air quality and forecast air pollution, the government is yet to devise a strategy on how to ensure that the advisories reach every resident in a city. Since the budgetary allocations for the environment ministry have been cut and it does not have extra funds for pollution abatement, the Centre may not be able to help states reduce air pollution. The environment ministry had expressed its inability to help state governments with the execution of air quality standards. With the launch of the index on April 7 at an environment conference, the Centre hopes the state governments will focus on introducing and promoting greener means of public transport to clean their air.

Hosted by former state television reporter Chai Jing, ""Under the Dome"" offers a well-produced look at the cost to the environment of 30 years of breakneck economic development. Chai discusses the issues before a studio audience while standing in front of a screen showing videos of polluting industries, interviews with affected people and visits by her to sites in China and abroad illustrating the extent of the problem. It also faults government regulators for failing to crack down on polluters and permitting the widespread burning of the most polluting types of coal, oil and gasoline. Chai said she was moved to produce the 104-minute documentary out of concern for the effect of pollution on her infant daughter's health. Costing about $160,000 to make, the documentary won praise Sunday from new Chinese Environment Minister Chen Jining, who said it reflected ""growing public concern over environmental protection and threats to human health."" The documentary was posted online on Saturday. By Monday evening, it had more than 175 million views on popular video sites Youku and Tencent. Better produced than much of the stodgy fare on state television, it falls stylistically somewhere between a TED talk and Al Gore's 2006 Academy Award-winning documentary ""An Inconvenient Truth."" The documentary prompted wide speculation over how much official support Chai received and whether the production was truly independent or just an example of slick, viewer-friendly state publicity. Years of choking pollution in Beijing and other major cities has fed a groundswell of opposition to growth at any cost, and the slowing economy has allowed the government to take more measures to crack down on heavily polluting factories in the cement, steel and petrochemical industries. In November, the government pledged to produce 20 percent of the country's total energy with non-fossil fuels by 2030, doubling its current level, while capping growth in carbon emissions by the same year, it not earlier. ""The environment is a sensitive issue that concerns the interests of all sides,"" said Yu Guoming, a journalism professor at Beijing's Renmin University, commenting on the documentary's popularity. ""Fighting pollution enjoys broad support from the public and ... can also be used as leverage to promote changes to the economic structure in the future,"" Yu said.

The city is literally gasping for breath, with air pollution levels seeming to be skyrocketing without any restraint. A recent survey on the Most Livable Cities in the world by ECA International, found out that Delhi is the most polluted cities, not just in India and Asia, but also in the world. While New Delhi ranks 45 in the livability index in India, it is at a dismal 204 in the world. Another survey by the CSE revealed that open modes like autorickshaws, walking and cycling have the highest exposure of the city pollution. “During off-peak hours, all modes show lower levels: Difference between peak and off-peak was as follows -- autos 1.3 times higher; walking 1.5 times higher, and buses 2.5 times higher,"" the CSE says. Taking note of a report that said Delhi was the most polluted city in the world, the Delhi High Court recently said if nobody was looking into the issue, it will start giving directions and fix responsibility on the authorities. A division bench of Justice B.D. Ahmed and Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva asked the city government to check whether the Supreme Court was seized of the issue dealing with air pollution in the capital. ""I had a talk with a paediatrician. He said 50 percent of children in Delhi are suffering from respiratory problems. It's not acceptable. If nobody is looking into the issue, it's high time we act into it,"" the bench said. Doctors say poor air quality is one of the main reasons behind the rising cases of lung infections, heart attacks, and cancer in the national capital. Another study showed that more than 3,000 premature deaths occur every year in Delhi due to air -pollution related diseases. Meanwhile the administration in the capital is working upon long term and capital intensive solutions which may not bear fruit in the near future. A glaring example of this is Delhi's Metro which is in its 12th year is already  ferrying 2.5 million passengers daily, but Metro requires huge investments and it also takes time to build the infrastructure of it. The phase III of the Delhi metro will already cost Rs 45,000 to the government's exchequer. The option that is available before the government is to operate more buses because it is not only cheaper but also can be put to service as and when required. Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) is presently having a fleet of buses which is half the number of the actual buses required. Another option before the Delhi Government is to revive the already dead Ring Rail network which was started during the 1982 Asian Games.

Over half of India's population - 660 million people - live in areas where fine particulate matter pollution is above India's standards for what is considered safe, said the study by economists from the University of Chicago, Harvard and Yale published in this week's ‘Economic & Political Weekly'.  If India reverses this trend to meet its air standards, those 660 million people would gain about 3.2 years onto their lives, the study said. Put another way, compliance with Indian air quality standards would save 2.1 billion life-years, it said.  “India's focus is necessarily on growth. However, for too long, the conventional definition of growth has ignored the health consequences of air pollution,” said Michael Greenstone, an author of the study and director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC).  “This study demonstrates that air pollution retards growth by causing people to die prematurely. Other studies have also shown that air pollution reduces productivity at work, increases the incidence of sick days, and raises health care expenses that could be devoted to other goods.” The new figures come after the WHO estimates showed 13 of the 20 most polluted cities in the world were in India, including the worst-ranked city, Delhi.  India has the highest rate of death caused by chronic respiratory diseases anywhere in the world.  “The loss of more than two billion life years is a substantial price to pay for air pollution,” said Rohini Pande, also an author and director of Evidence for Policy Design at the Harvard Kennedy School. “It is in India's power to change this in cost effective ways that allow hundreds of millions of its citizens to live longer, healthier, and more productive lives. Reforms of the current form of regulation would allow for health improvements that lead to increased growth,” Pande said.  The authors - who also include Nicholas Ryan of Yale, Janhavi Nilekani and Anish Sugathan of Harvard, and Anant Sudarshan, director of EPIC's India office - offer three policy solutions that would help to cost-effectively decrease India's pollution. One initial step would be to increase its monitoring efforts and take advantage of new technology that allows for real-time monitoring, the authors said.

However, underground Metro rail protects from the high level of pollution, says data prepared by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). Shunned as one of the world's most polluted cities, Delhi is literally gasping for breath, with air pollution levels seeming to be skyrocketing without any restraint, it says. According to it, exposure in all transport modes in Delhi is very high with the average levels recording at 2 to 4 times higher than the background levels reported by the state pollution control board. The traffic police is breathing “unacceptably high levels of toxic air”, it says. Monitoring carried out at the ITO crossing showed peak exposure at eight times the ambient level. “Open modes like autorickshaws, walking and cycling have the highest exposure. During off-peak hours, all modes show lower levels: Difference between peak and off-peak was as follows—autos 1.3 times higher; walking 1.5 times higher, and buses 2.5 times higher,” the CSE says. It says underground Metro with sealed environment shows lower levels of about 209 microgramme per cubic metre. The overhead metro had levels of 330 microgramme per cubic metre. Pollution levels peak near junctions and in traffic jams: “In a traffic jam on a stretch close to Paharganj, levels peaked at 1,170 microgramme per cu m. At a traffic jam near Govindpuri Metro Station, the peak level was 725 microgramme per cu m,” the data says. Noting that proximity to diesel trucks lead to extremely high exposure, the CSE data says a cycle rickshaw ride on NH-24 in close proximity to truck traffic recorded a range of 651 to 2,000 microgramme per cu m. Even cars do not help. It says monitoring inside the car was carried out during off-peak hours and the average levels were found to be double the ambient levels.

The programme is meant to monitor air-quality in host cities and countries to help US personnel posted there take better care of themselves. It was started years ago in Beijing and will be expanding to many other cities around the world starting with India. The programme, as announced by the Secretary of state John Kerry, is an agreement between his department and the Environment Protection Agency with India as its first destination and Vietnam next. A factsheet released by the department of the state said, “""Air pollution is a serious and growing health threat worldwide, yet in many areas, real-time air quality data is not available.” It further speaks of doubts in strategy to be implemented with Delhi in India. US believes that the Beijing experiment worked well not only for the Americans posted their but for the people of the host country too which eventually lead China down the path of pollution control. ""Our experts would be taking off in the next few weeks to get this programme started in India,"" said EPA administrator Gina McCarthy at the launch of the programme. Apparently, hushed under the covers, the stated objective of helping US personnel is an assumption that the targeted host countries are incapable to monitor air quality – suspended particulate matter – on their own.

The air-quality monitoring survey carried out by Greenpeace inside five prominent schools across Delhi found the particulate matter (PM) 2.5 levels to be four times the Indian safety limits and 10 times that of the World Health Organisation, said a statement by the NGO. PM refers to the particles found in the air, including dust, dirt, soot, smoke, and liquid droplets. Particles less than 10 micrometers in diameter (PM10) pose a health concern because they can be inhaled into and accumulate in the respiratory system. Based on a study conducted by US Environmental Protection Agency, Greenpeace India claimed that the particulate matter 2.5 is a ""very unhealthy"" level that ""will mean reduced lung functioning, increase in asthma and respiratory illnesses"". ""This establishes the fact that air pollution levels inside Delhi's schools are alarmingly high and that children are consistently breathing bad air. The government needs to acknowledge the severity of air pollution in the city and its corresponding health impacts,"" said Greenpeace campaigner Aishwarya Madineni.

A bench of justices Badar Durrez Ahmed and Sanjeev Sachdeva issued notice to the Centre, Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and other civic authorities and listed the matter for hearing on February 11, court sources said. The court took up the issue suo motu (on its own) after it came across news reports that Delhi was one of the most polluted cities in the world with regard to air pollution. The bench had also come across information that over 50 per cent of children in Delhi suffered from respiratory problem caused due to poor ambient air quality here. Terming such a situation as “unacceptable” the court had earlier asked DPCC to inform it whether the Supreme Court is looking into the matter of air pollution. DPCC on February 6 had informed the court that one matter regarding environment pollution, titled M C Mehta, was pending before the apex court, while another petition on air pollution in Delhi and surrounding states is before the National Green Tribunal (NGT). DPCC had also informed the court that several comprehensive orders have been issued by NGT.  “We have nothing to do with NGT. Can't leave it to them,” the bench had remarked.

Dr Gufran Beig from the state-run System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research on Monday said that the level of pollution in January has gone up significantly. He said that earlier in January, the average of 2.5 particulate matter (pm) in air used to hover around 200 to 300 microgram per cubic meter but this time the figure has crossed the 370 mark in the same unit. The rise in pollution level has become a matter of serious concern for the authorities and also for the people living in the city. The level of carbon monoxide was recorded at normal level. Dr Beig further said that the frequent change in weather condition, especially in last few days, could be a reason behind this.

These vehicles would be now seized by authorities as per the Motor Vehicle (MV) Act. The tribunal also asked the Regional Transport Office (RTO) not to renew or issue registration for such vehicles or provide fitness certificates, besides stating that if such vehicle if found parked in a public area, it would be challaned. NGT, which has the powers of a civil court, also barred burning of waste in the open. The tribunal sought immediate steps for building cycle tracks in the city and asked authorities to probe the possibility of installing air purifiers at marketplaces. It also ordered stricter vigil on overloaded trucks entering the city. The NGT further said that any person will have the right to approach directly the tribunal, police to complain about open burning of plastics, leaves and other materials which can result in air pollution. It also directed the Delhi government to create a web portal where public can upload pictures of any such violations. The orders were issued by a bench headed by NGT chairperson Swatanter Kumar, with expert members DK Agarwal and AR Yousuf, in response to a petition filed early this year on Delhi's air pollution by Vardhaman Kaushik.

The plea, filed by advocate Ashwini Upadhyay, argued that the TDS mechanism infringes upon constitutional rights. While declining the petition, the bench observed that the plea was ""very badly drafted"" and should be moved to the Delhi High Court. “Sorry, we will not entertain it. It is very badly drafted. However, you can move the Delhi High Court,” CJI Sanjiv Khanna said, adding levy of TDS has been the practice in many countries. The plea filed through advocate Ashwani Dubey sought to scrap the TDS system calling it ""arbitrary and irrational"" and violative of various fundamental rights, including equality. It challenged the TDS framework under the Income Tax Act, which mandates the deduction of tax at the time of payment by the payer and its deposit with the income tax department. The deducted amount is adjusted against the payee's tax liability. The plea had made the Centre, ministry of law and justice, law commission, and NITI Aayog as parties. It should be mentioned here that the Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) system is a mechanism of tax collection in India, designed to ensure that taxes are collected at the very source of income generation. Under this system, the payer (referred to as the deductor) is required to deduct a certain percentage of tax before making a payment to the recipient (referred to as the deductee). The deducted tax is then deposited with the government. The petition had sought a re-evaluation of its structure and legality.

The trailer of the film was released earlier this week and one of the scenes from it led to objection by a Maratha group. Maratha organisation Sambhaji Brigade has objected to the dance sequence of Vicky Kaushal and Rashmika Mandanna, who are portraying the roles of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and Maharani Yesubai respectively in the film. Demanding the removal of the scene from the film, Sambhaji Brigade said that they are happy that a Hindi film has been made on Sambhaji Maharaj, but through this dance sequence, Sambhaji Maharaj is being insulted and it should be removed. Apart from Vicky and Rashmika, the film features Akshaye Khanna stepping into the role of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Apart from them, Vineet Kumar Singh, Ashutosh Rana, Divya Dutta, Neil Bhupalam, Santosh Juvekar and Pradeep Rawat will also be seen in important roles. The film is set to depict the courageous Maratha ruler's legendary reign, beginning with his coronation in 1681. Recently, the makers of Chhaava released new posters of its lead cast on social media, adding to the excitement among fans for the film. Chhaava is directed by Laxman Utekar while Maddock Films has produced it. The music is given by AR Rahman.

The match was tightly contested as Djokovic was in the lead for the majority of the time in the first set before Zverev launched a counterattack. The German eventually won the set 7-6 (7-5) on Rod Laver Arena before Djokovic pulled out of the competition. With that, Zverev advanced to the final of the 2025 Australian Open final, slated to take place on Sunday, January 26. The Serbian complained of a leg injury in the quarter-final against Carlos Alcaraz but managed to recover and went on to win the contest despite being a set down. He took a medical timeout after the opening set, which also invited criticism as many tennis legends called it one of Djokovic’s strategies. Meanwhile, after the match, the 37-year-old confirmed that had he not won the second set, he would have pulled out. The 10-time Australian Open winner also skipped his training session on Thursday to avoid any further injuries. He arrived to the semi-final with his leg taped up but managed to dominate early on before throwing his towel. Meanwhile, Zverev qualified for his maiden final at Melbourne Park. He will play the winner of Jannik Sinner and Ben Shelton in the summit clash. Interestingly, Djokovic was heavily booed after he informed about pulling out of the competition. In his on-court interview, Zverev urged the crowd to not boo a player when he’s out with an injury and reminded them that the 24-time Grand Slam winner has played with abdomina and hamstring injury previously and that he is very committed to the game. “The very first thing I want to say is please don't boo when a player is injured. I know everyone paid for tickets but Novak Djokovic is someone who has given everything to the sport. He has won this title with an abdominal injury, he has won this title with a hamstring injury. If he cannot continue a tennis match, he really cannot continue a tennis match,” Zverez said.

The plea, filed by advocate Ashwini Upadhyay, argued that the TDS mechanism infringes upon constitutional rights. While declining the petition, the bench observed that the plea was ""very badly drafted"" and should be moved to the Delhi High Court. “Sorry, we will not entertain it. It is very badly drafted. However, you can move the Delhi High Court,” CJI Sanjiv Khanna said, adding levy of TDS has been the practice in many countries. The plea filed through advocate Ashwani Dubey sought to scrap the TDS system calling it ""arbitrary and irrational"" and violative of various fundamental rights, including equality. It challenged the TDS framework under the Income Tax Act, which mandates the deduction of tax at the time of payment by the payer and its deposit with the income tax department. The deducted amount is adjusted against the payee's tax liability. The plea had made the Centre, ministry of law and justice, law commission, and NITI Aayog as parties. It should be mentioned here that the Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) system is a mechanism of tax collection in India, designed to ensure that taxes are collected at the very source of income generation.

It may be noted that the Ministry of Mines in a press release dated December 24, 2024, had stated that after the auction of the block, several representations have been received against the said auction on the ground that there is a Biodiversity Heritage Site within the block area. During the meeting on January 22, 2025, the Ambalakarars requested the Union Minister to cancel the auction of the Nayakkarpatti Tungsten block. The Union Minister patiently heard the delegation and expressed that the Union Government fully supports bio-diversity heritage protection. As per the release, after detailed deliberations, considering the importance of the Biodiversity Heritage Site in the area and the commitment of the Government of India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership towards protecting traditional rights, it has been decided to annul the auction of Nayakkarpatti Tungsten mineral block.

Spearheaded by Chief Minister Bhagwant Singh Mann, this ambitious programme aims to provide direct government access to the people of the state by bringing administrative services and grievance redressal to their doorsteps. The initiative is part of the government's broader commitment to making governance more transparent, efficient, and people-centric. The primary focus of the program is to ensure timely resolution of grievances while eliminating bureaucratic hurdles that often discourage people from approaching government offices. Launched on December 10, 2023, this people-centric initiative is transforming the way government services are delivered by enabling access to 43 essential services directly at the doorstep. The initiative has been hailed as a model of efficient governance and public welfare across the country. To access these services, citizens can simply call the dedicated helpline number 1076 between 9 am and 5 pm. Upon calling, they are provided with an appointment for their requested service. The application is then processed at the district level, with trained personnel and field officers visiting applicants' homes to collect documents and complete formalities. Verified applicants receive their e-certificates promptly, followed by hard copies through the mail. One of the key features of the 'Bhagwant Mann Sarkar Tuhade Dwar' is its affordability. Citizens are charged a nominal fee of Rs 120 for each service, with any additional fees depending on the nature of the request. This transparent pricing ensures access to essential services for everyone, irrespective of financial constraints, making governance more inclusive. The initiative not only benefits citizens but also addresses unemployment among the youth of Punjab. By employing nearly 4,000 trained operators in service centres across the state, the government has created secure job opportunities for young professionals. These operators, working in tandem with field officers, ensure the seamless execution of services under the programme. The 'Bhagwant Mann Sarkar Tuhade Dwar' programme is part of the Punjab government's vision of creating a 'Rangla Punja' -- a vibrant and progressive state. By emphasising transparent and accessible governance, the initiative saves valuable time and money for people while fostering trust in public systems. (Disclaimer: This is sponsored content.

Both Pompeo and Hook face continued threats from Iran after they took a hardline stance on the Islamic Republic while in office during Trump's first stint as president. The decision comes after Trump decided to revoke the security clearance of John Bolton, the former national security adviser who was fired during his first term as US President. Earlier, Bolton wrote a book that the White House unsuccessfully sought to block, citing the disclosure of national security information. In a statement, Bolton said he was disappointed by the decision but not surprised. When Trump was asked about his decision to end Pompeo and Hook's security, Trump said, ""Do you want to have a large detail of people guarding people for the rest of their lives? I mean, there's risks to everything."" The relations between Trump and Pompeo soared some months ago as Trump publicly revealed that the former secretary of state would be given no role in his new administration. The US President also fired Hook from his presidentially appointed position on the board of the Wilson Center, a think tank. Both Pompeo and Hook used to be the public faces of the US “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran after Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, which offered relief on sanctions in exchange for drastically limiting its nuclear program. The Islamic Republic has blamed both for the killing of Iran Revolutionary Guard commander Qassem Soleimani on January 3, 2020. According to a March 2022 report to Congress, the State Department said it was paying more than $2 million per month to provide 24-hour security to Pompeo and Hook. But later determinations did not give a dollar amount. Earlier this month, the officials of the Biden administration briefed Trump officials about the ongoing threat posed by Iran to Pompeo, Hook, Bolton, and others. It also explained why the security details for them have been extended, according to a former senior Biden administration official familiar with the matter.

Trump, who threatened to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China, told reporters that he plans to tariff Canada and Mexico at 25% rates starting February 1. Trudeau said Canada would respond with retaliatory measures, imposing tariffs, and ""prices for American consumers on just about everything will go up."" Trudeau added, ""We don't think he (Trump) wants that."" While Trump claims the US does not need Canada, nearly a quarter of the oil America consumes per day comes from America's second-largest trading partner. If Trump targets Canada, he may risk upending the markets for autos, lumber, and oil, which will have a direct impact on consumers. Notably, the US is eager for almost 34 critical minerals and metals that Canada has, while Ottawa is the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminium and uranium to Washington. ""The US should be working even more with Canada on our energy, on our critical minerals, and on the goods they need to deliver the economic growth that Donald Trump has promised,” Trudeau said. Canada is likely to impose retaliatory tariffs on American orange juice, toilets, and some steel products if Trump follows through with his threat. When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, Canada announced billions of dollars in new duties in 2018 against the US in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminium. ""Everything is on the table,"" Trudeau said. ""It would be bad for Canada, but it would also be bad for American consumers,"" he added. The US president told reporters at the White House earlier this week that, in his opinion, the amount of fentanyl coming through Canada and Mexico is “massive."" “We have highlighted that less than one per cent of illegal drugs coming into the United States, less than one per cent of migrants going into the United States come from Canada but we're still investing over a billion dollars and strengthening our border,” Trudeau said. Nearly USD 2.7 billion, which translates into 3.6 billion Canadian dollars worth of goods and services pass the US-Canada border each day. Notably, Canada is also the top export destination for 36 US states.

Trump also highlighted the disparity in financial contributions, noting that the US has spent USD 200 billion more than NATO on the conflict. Speaking about the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Trump said, ""As we restore common sense in America, we're moving quickly to bring back strength, peace, and stability abroad. I'm also going to ask all NATO nations to increase defense spending to 5 percent of GDP, which is what it should have been years ago."" ""It was only at 2 percent, and most nations didn't pay until I came along. I insisted they pay, and they did, because the United States was really paying the difference at that time, and it was unfair to the United States,"" he added. Trump reiterated his previous remarks, made during a signing ceremony at the Oval Office, underscoring NATO's financial contributions. ""NATO has to pay 5 percent. We are in the Ukraine war with USD 200 billion more than NATO. It's ridiculous because it affects them a lot more. We have an ocean in between. And we've spent USD 200 billion more on Ukraine than NATO has spent. They've got to equalize,"" he said. US President Donald Trump also spoke about the ceasefire negotiations in the West Asia. President Trump also underlined the immediate changes he has implemented in American domestic and international policies since assuming his second term as President of the United States. During his address, President Trump stated that he would urge NATO countries to increase their defense spending. Trump also addressed various international issues. He called on Saudi Arabia and OPEC countries to lower oil prices, discussed the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and highlighted several American policies, including the deployment of troops along the US southern border to curb illegal immigration. The US President also spoke about ceasefire negotiations in West Asia, noting the efforts made by his administration. He said, ""Before even taking office, my team negotiated the ceasefire agreement in the Middle East, which wouldn't have happened without us.""

Judge Julian Goose said 18-year-old Axel Rudakubana “wanted to try and carry out the mass murder of innocent, happy young girls.” Goose said that he couldn’t impose a sentence of life without parole, because Rudakubana was under 18 when he committed the crime. But the judge said he must serve 52 years, minus the six months he’s been in custody, before being considered for parole, and “likely, he will never be released.” Rudakubana was 17 when he attacked the children in the seaside town of Southport in July, killing Alice Da Silva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6. He wounded eight other girls, ranging in age from 7 to 13, along with teacher Leanne Lucas and John Hayes, a local businessman who intervened. The attack shocked the country and set off both street violence and soul-searching. Defendant disrupts the hearing Rudakubana faced three counts of murder, 10 of attempted murder and additional charges of possessing a knife, the poison ricin and an al-Qaida manual. He unexpectedly changed his plea to guilty on all charges on Monday. But he wasn’t in court to hear sentence passed on Thursday. Hours earlier he had been led into the dock at Liverpool Crown Court in northwest England, dressed in a gray prison tracksuit. But as prosecutors began outlining the evidence, Rudakubana interrupted by shouting that he felt ill and wanted to see a paramedic. Goose ordered the accused to be removed when he continued shouting. A person in the courtroom shouted “Coward!” as Rudakubana was taken out. The hearing continued without him. Horror on a summer day Prosecutor Deanna Heer described how the attack occurred on the first day of summer vacation when 26 little girls were “gathered around the tables making bracelets and singing along to Taylor Swift songs.” Rudakubana, armed with a large knife, intruded and began stabbing the girls and their teacher. The court was shown video of the suspect arriving at the Hart Space venue in a taxi and entering the building. Within seconds, screams erupted and children ran outside in panic, some of them wounded. One girl made it to the doorway, but was pulled back inside by the attacker. She was stabbed 32 times but survived. Gasps and sobs could be heard in court as the videos played. Heer said two of the dead children “suffered particularly horrific injuries which are difficult to explain as anything other than sadistic in nature.” One of the dead girls had 122 injuries, while another suffered 85 wounds. A teenager obsessed with violence The prosecutor said Rudakubana had “a longstanding obsession with violence, killing, genocide.” “His only purpose was to kill. And he targeted the youngest and most vulnerable in society,” she said, as relatives of the victims watched on in the courtroom. Heer said that when he was taken to a police station, Rudakubana was heard to say, “It’s a good thing those children are dead, I’m so glad, I’m so happy.” The killings triggered days of anti-immigrant violence across the country after far-right activists seized on incorrect reports that the attacker was an asylum-seeker who had recently arrived in the UK Some suggested the crime was a jihadi attack, and alleged that police and the government were withholding information. Rudakubana was born in Cardiff, Wales, to Christian parents from Rwanda, and investigators haven’t been able to pin down his motivation. Police found documents about subjects including Nazi Germany, the Rwandan genocide and car bombs on his devices. In the years before the attack, he had been reported to multiple authorities over his violent interests and actions. All of the agencies failed to spot the danger he posed. In 2019, he phoned a children’s advice line to ask “What should I do if I want to kill somebody?” He said he had taken a knife to school because he wanted to kill someone who was bullying him. Two months later, he attacked a fellow student with a hockey stick and was convicted of assault. The definition of terrorism Prosecutors said Rudakubana was referred three times to the government’s anti-extremism program, Prevent, when he was 13 and 14- once after researching school shootings in class, then for uploading pictures of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi to Instagram and for researching a London terror attack. But they concluded his crimes should not be classed as terrorism because Rudakubana had no discernable political or religious cause. Heer said “his purpose was the commission of mass murder, not for a particular end, but as an end in itself.” Prime Minister Keir Starmer said this week the country must face up to a “new threat” from violent individuals whose mix of motivations test the traditional definition of terrorism. “After one of the most harrowing moments in our country’s history, we owe it to these innocent young girls and all those affected to deliver the change that they deserve,” Starmer said after the sentencing. Wrenching testimony from victims Several relatives and survivors read emotional statements in court, describing how the attack had shattered their lives. Lucas, 36, who ran the dance class, said that “the trauma of being both a victim and a witness has been horrendous.” “I cannot give myself compassion or accept praise, as how can I live knowing I survived when children died?” she said. A 14-year-old survivor, who can’t be named because of a court order, said that while she was physically recovering. “we will all have to live with the mental pain from that day forever.” “I hope you spend the rest of your life knowing that we think you’re a coward,” she said. The prosecutor read out a statement from the parents of Alice Da Silva Aguiar, who said their daughter’s killing had “shattered our souls.” “We used to cook for three. Now we only cook for two. It doesn’t seem right,” they said. “Alice was our purpose for living, so what do we do now?”.

He also became a pan-India star with this film. After 'KGF', its second part took Yash's popularity to the next level. Both films together earned more than Rs 1500 crore, which is one of the highest-grossing Kannada films of all time. This success established Yash as a superstar, but reaching here was not easy for the actor. Starting as the son of a bus driver, Yash has travelled a long way to success. Let's have a look at his success journey here. Left home to fulfil the dream When Yash was just 16 years old, he convinced his parents to leave home and fulfil his dream of acting in cinema. He was hired as an assistant director in a Kannada film. However, the project was shelved just two days after he reached Bangalore. Talking about this, the actor said, 'I ran away from my house. When I came to Bangalore, I was scared as soon as I arrived. Such a big, intimidating city, but I was always a confident boy. I was not afraid to struggle. When I reached Bangalore, I had only Rs 300 in my pocket. I knew that if I went back, my parents would never let me come back here.' Yash had only Rs 300 and he joined the Benaka Drama Troupe. Here he worked as a backstage hand. Here he used to do small jobs like serving tea and earned Rs 50 per day. Along with honing his art in theatre, Yash also enrolled in college. Eventually, he got a chance to act in the TV series Nanda Gokula, where he met actress Radhika Pandit, his now wife. In 2007, Yash entered films with a supporting role in Jambada Hudugi, before playing the lead role in Rocky (2008). Yash finally got success as a lead star with the romantic comedy Modalasala. The following year he established himself as a bankable star with the success of Kirataka. Over the next few years, he gave hits like Mogina Manasu, Drama, Googly, Mr and Mrs Ramachari and Masterpiece. KGF brought him stardom In 2018, Yash starred in KGF: Chapter 1, which broke all box office records by earning 250 crores. It was the highest-grossing Kannada film of all time. This record stood for four years. Then KGF: Chapter 2 broke it by earning a whopping Rs 1250 crore. The film is one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time and is the only Kannada film to have grossed over Rs 1000 crore. Yash's world outside Kannada cinema The national stardom he got from KGF helped Yash to break out of Kannada cinema. According to reports, he was signed to play the role of Raavan in Nitesh Tiwari's Ramayan. Starring Ranbir Kapoor and Sai Pallavi, the film is said to be the most expensive film in India. Yash is also the co-producer of the film and according to reports, he has charged Rs 200 crore to be a part of the film. It is a big journey for someone who once used to survive on Rs 50 per day.

The match was tightly contested as Djokovic was in the lead for the majority of the time in the first set before Zverev launched a counterattack. The German eventually won the set 7-6 (7-5) on Rod Laver Arena before Djokovic pulled out of the competition. With that, Zverev advanced to the final of the 2025 Australian Open final, slated to take place on Sunday, January 26. The Serbian complained of a leg injury in the quarter-final against Carlos Alcaraz but managed to recover and went on to win the contest despite being a set down. He took a medical timeout after the opening set, which also invited criticism as many tennis legends called it one of Djokovic’s strategies. Meanwhile, after the match, the 37-year-old confirmed that had he not won the second set, he would have pulled out. The 10-time Australian Open winner also skipped his training session on Thursday to avoid any further injuries. He arrived to the semi-final with his leg taped up but managed to dominate early on before throwing his towel. Meanwhile, Zverev qualified for his maiden final at Melbourne Park. He will play the winner of Jannik Sinner and Ben Shelton in the summit clash. Interestingly, Djokovic was heavily booed after he informed about pulling out of the competition. In his on-court interview, Zverev urged the crowd to not boo a player when he’s out with an injury and reminded them that the 24-time Grand Slam winner has played with abdomina and hamstring injury previously and that he is very committed to the game. “The very first thing I want to say is please don't boo when a player is injured. I know everyone paid for tickets but Novak Djokovic is someone who has given everything to the sport. He has won this title with an abdominal injury, he has won this title with a hamstring injury. If he cannot continue a tennis match, he really cannot continue a tennis match,” Zverez said.

The Serbian beat Carlos Alcaraz 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 in the quarters to advance to the semis. However, he dealt with a leg injury in the game and even opted for a medical time-out after the first set. After a few minutes he made his return back to the court and since, the 37-year-old looked flawless and managed to get over the line against Alcaraz to move an inch closer to his 25th career Grand Slam. The injury however bothered Djokovic’s preparations. He didn’t train for the match against Alexander Zverev and in the semis, he pulled out after just the first set. Despite being heavily taped up, Djokovic looked to be in good shape for the game at Melbourne Park but the injury soon started to bother him, resulting in him throwing his towel in the middle. After the match, the 24-time Grand Slam winner revealed that he was dealing with a muscle tear and tried his best to continue but it wasn’t meant to be. He added that towards the end of the first set, things got extremely difficult for him and despite his best attempts to continue, he had to withdraw. “I did everything I possibly could to basically manage the muscle tear that I had. Towards the end of that first set, I started feeling more and more pain and it was too much to handle for me at the moment. It was an unfortunate ending, but I tried,” Djokovic said in the press conference. Meanwhile, Djokovic also pulled out of the Roland Garros in 2024. The 10-time Australian Open winner acknowledged that injuries have started bothering his career but he hasn’t been able to pinpoint the reason behind it. However, he is optimistic of a strong return and noted that he is striving to win more slams in his career. “How much of a worry is it? I don’t know. It’s not like I’m worrying approaching every grand slam now whether I’m going to get injured or not, but statistics are against me, in a way, in the last couple of years. So it is true that (I have been) getting injured quite a bit last few years. I don’t know what exactly is the reason for that, you know? “Maybe (there are) several differently factors. But I’ll keep going. I’ll keep striving to win more slams. And as long as I feel that I want to put up with all of this, I’ll be around,” Djokovic added.

The caravan now moves to Chennai as the second T20I is set to be played at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, famously known as Chepauk. England are playing a T20I in Chennai for the first time while team India are also returning to the venue in the shortest format after a gap of seven long years. India last played a T20I at Chepauk back in November 2018 against the West Indies when Rohit Sharma led the team. It was a completely different Indian team to what it is now and the hosts had won the clash by six wickets chasing down 182 runs in the last-ball thriller. After winning the toss, West Indies batted superbly and on the back of Nicholas Pooran's unbeaten 53 off 25 balls with four fours and as many sixes, they managed to post a daunting total of 181 runs for the loss of three wickets. In response, Shikhar Dhawan led the chase for India opening the innings and scored 92 runs off 62 deliveries. Rishabh Pant also slammed his maiden half-century in the format scoring 58 runs off 38 deliveries before getting out. Things got close in the end with Dhawan being dismissed in the final over but the men in blue managed to get over the line on the final ball to seal the series 3-0. Team India return to the venue seven years later and none of the players from that playing XI is featuring in the current line-up. Rohit Sharma has retired from T20Is while Shikhar Dhawan and Dinesh Karthik have bid adieu to international cricket. All the other players have been sidelined from the format with only Washington Sundar being the part of the current squad.

But with the ball, he is still a work in progress and against Australia, India also struggled to find a solid number eight batter, where they missed a player like Shardul Thakur. The man is nowhere close to the international team across formats, and it is very surprising. He was the player who scored vital runs down the order especially away from home for India whenever the batting line-up failed. His knocks in England and Australia, especially at the Gabba in 2021 are still fondly remembered. He sent a timely reminder to the Ajit Agarkar-led selection panel with a similar performance on the opening day of the Ranji Trophy clash between Mumbai and Jammu and Kashmir. Thakur saved Mumbai from massive embarrassment as the 43-time winners were reduced to 47/7 against Jammu and Kashmir despite a host of international stars including Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal playing for the team. He smashed a quickfire half-century to propel the team's score to 120 in the first innings. He then came back and bowled 13 overs picking up Abdul Samad's wicket just when he was looking good on 19 runs. ""What can I talk about my quality? Others should talk about it. They should see that if someone has quality, he should be given more chances. I like batting in difficult situations. In easy situations, everyone does well, but how you put up the show in adverse situations matters. I see tough situations as a challenge and always think about how to overcome that challenge,"" Thakur said after the end of the day's play.

Among these is the highly anticipated triple-foldable smartphone. In addition, Samsung teased its upcoming VR headset and the sleek Galaxy S25 Edge, touted as the thinnest smartphone yet. The design of the triple foldable phone was showcased in a prototype shared by the company, which is expected to resemble Huawei's own triple-foldable model. Samsung, a leader in the foldable smartphone market, aims to release this innovative device in the latter half of the year. Huawei's version, which was launched commercially last year, has set a precedent in this category. Samsung introduced the concept of its triple-foldable phone at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) a few years ago, and during the Galaxy Unpacked event in 2025, the company officially teased the prototype, indicating that a market launch is on the horizon. The triple-foldable smartphone from Samsung is anticipated to feature a display size ranging from 9.9 to 10 inches. When folded, it will take on a more compact smartphone appearance. The device may incorporate a G-style folding design, complete with two hinges to facilitate the folding mechanism. In contrast, Huawei's Mate X showcases an S-shaped design. However, if recent reports hold true, Samsung plans to produce a limited quantity of its triple-foldable smartphone, with only 200,000 units set for release. These foldable phones are designed to bend open in both directions, allowing users to unfold them for a tablet-like experience, while still being compact when folded. Meanwhile, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge has a thickness of 6.4mm and features a dual-camera setup on the back. In comparison, the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25+ include a triple-camera system.

Following TRAI's directive, major telecom players such as Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone Idea have rolled out voice-only plans, a move that has been in the works for some time. These voice-only options from Jio, Airtel, and Vi offer much-needed respite to countless consumers who were previously forced to choose plans that included costly data, even if they didn't require it. Now, with these new offerings, users can opt for voice-only plans and avoid unnecessary data charges. Recently, TRAI asked telecom service providers to include affordable plans focused solely on calling. In response to this request, Jio, Airtel, and Vi have introduced economical voice-only options. Let’s take a closer look at the specifics of these plans. Jio has unveiled two budget-friendly voice-only plans priced at Rs 458 and Rs 1958. The Rs 458 plan offers customers 84 days of validity, which includes unlimited calling across all networks and 1000 free SMS. On the other hand, Jio's Rs 1958 plan provides an impressive validity of 365 days. With this plan, users can enjoy the convenience of unlimited calling across all networks throughout the year, along with 3600 free SMS. Airtel has also launched two voice-only plans for its customers: one at Rs 509 and the other at Rs 1999. The Rs 509 plan offers unlimited calling in all networks for 84 days, along with 900 free SMS. For the Rs 1999 plan, Airtel provides a full year of validity, meaning that users can relax and forget about recharging for an entire 365 days. This plan includes unlimited calling to all networks and 3600 free SMS. Vodafone Idea (Vi) has joined the fray with its own voice-only option, although it has introduced just one plan priced at Rs 1460. This plan offers 270 days of validity, allowing for unlimited free calling to all networks. In addition, users receive 100 free SMS daily throughout the duration of the plan. Overall, these voice-only plans represent a significant shift in the offerings of Jio, Airtel, and Vi, catering to users who primarily seek calling services without the added costs of data.

The state-owned company has recently expanded its 4G network, which is now operational at over 65,000 sites. Users in these areas can enjoy a strong signal, broader coverage, and faster speeds thanks to BSNL's 4G services. With the rollout of 4G across more than 65,000 locations, BSNL is on track to meet its goal of 100,000 4G sites by mid-2025. However, this announcement comes at a time when the telecom operator has reportedly lost more than 300,000 subscribers as per the latest TRAI data from November. Many users have voiced their concerns about frequent call drops, disconnections, and connectivity issues on the BSNL network. In the past, BSNL officials have acknowledged these problems and have assured customers that they will be resolved by February this year. In other news, BSNL, the government-owned telecom company, is making waves in digital entertainment by launching its Internet Fiber TV (IFTV) service in Rajasthan. The service started with a pilot program in Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, and now it's expanding to several states, allowing users to stream TV for free without interruptions. BSNL's IFTV service is India's first internet TV that uses fiber technology. After its initial launch in Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, it has also rolled out in Punjab, Chandigarh, and Gujarat. With the addition of Rajasthan, IFTV is now available in many important regions across the country. BSNL customers using Bharat Fiber can enjoy over 500 live TV channels without any extra charges. In other news, Aitel, Jio, and Vi have introduced new recharge plans that focus solely on voice and SMS for their subscribers.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) have initiated an inquiry into the irregularities in the scholarship programme. The ED has been investigating the money laundering angle in the case. Along with the CBI, the ED is also investigating this scam of Rs 181 crore due to allegations of money laundering. However, a total fraud of Rs 250 crore has taken place in the case. Now, in this case, the former Deputy Director of Shimla, ED office and a DSP of CBI have been arrested. The matter is related to demanding a bribe of Rs 2.5 crore and receiving Rs 55 lakh in cash. According to the sources, the scam started in the year 2013. From 2013 to 2019, private institutions of Himachal Pradesh committed fraud in the scholarship of students. In this case, ED registered a case of money laundering and started an investigation. Vishaldeep, Deputy Director of ED office in Shimla, demanded a bribe from private institutions to settle a case. He was demanding one Rs one crore from each institution. During this, a case of a bribe of Rs 2.5 crore came to light. The CBI team first raided the ED office in Shimla and arrested the brother of Vishaldeep. The CBI also recovered Rs 55 lakh in cash during the probe. Vishaldeep kept dodging the CBI for several days and was then arrested from Mumbai 18 days later. On the other hand, on January 20, 2025, the CBI arrested its DSP Balbir Singh from Delhi in the same case. He was produced in court on January 21 and sent on one-day remand. It is alleged that the DSP was demanding 10 per cent commission in the bribe money. 2.38 lakh ST, SC and minority category students were to get scholarships in Himachal Pradesh. Scholarships were also to be given to students of private institutions of the state, but, the money for this scholarship was embezzled by private institutions in a fraudulent manner. Fake admissions of students were shown and money was taken because this amount was not given directly to the students, but was given through colleges. Money was deposited in bank accounts linked to 4 mobile numbers in the name of 19,915 students. At present, the total fraud is more than 250 crores. It is worth noting that on August 31, 2023, ED raided 24 places in 4 states and seized assets worth Rs 4.42 crore. When IAS officer Arun Sharma was the Education Secretary, he first got the case registered. He investigated at his level and found that some officers and employees of the Education Department, in connivance with the brokers of the institutions, embezzled the scholarship money. In this case, the Jairam government had recommended a CBI inquiry in the year 2019 and then the ED also started an investigation at its level. In December 2024, the CBI raided the ED office in Shimla thrice in a row. After this, on 30 December 2024 in Shimla, Rajneesh Bansal, Chairman of Himachal Pradesh's private educational institution Himalayan Group of Institutions, Bhupinder Sharma, Chairman of Devbhoomi Group of Institutions, Sanjeev Prabhakar, Chairman of ICL Group of Institutions and D.J. Singh, Chairman of Divyajyoti Group of Institutions, had accused the ED of extortion, misbehavior and torture.

After taking over as the 47th President of the US, Trump declared January 20 as ""Liberation Day,"" promising smooth and sweeping changes as he proclaimed, ""America’s decline is over"" and that the ""golden age"" of the nation had just begun. Returning to the White House, Trump wasted no time leveraging executive orders to launch his ambitious agenda. Among his first actions were moves to boost domestic energy production and halt diversity, equity, and inclusion programmes within the federal government. Setting the tone for his administration’s priorities, the Republican leader stressed that these decisions would usher in rapid transformations. Signing executive orders on the first day in office is a common practice for incoming presidents that enables them to enact immediate changes without congressional approval. However, experts point out that while executive orders can signal intent and spur initial actions, their scope is limited when it comes to long-term policy shifts. Executive orders are powerful tools used by US presidents to direct how the federal government operates. These signed statements essentially communicate a president’s wishes for managing federal agencies, issuing instructions, or even requesting reports. While some executive orders are relatively minor, such as designating holidays for federal employees, others can establish significant policies that shape the direction of the country. Presidents frequently use executive orders to implement actions they cannot easily get through Congress. In fact, executive orders can override or cancel the policies of previous administrations, offering a swift way to enact change without legislative approval. This power is especially noticeable when a new president takes office, as they may use executive orders to undo the previous president's actions. For example, on his first day in office, President Donald Trump rescinded 78 orders and actions signed by President Biden, including several that had reversed Trump’s own policies from his first term. These actions demonstrate how executive orders can serve as tools to reshape the federal government’s priorities. Though executive orders do not require approval from Congress, lawmakers still hold some influence. They can limit or obstruct the implementation of orders by removing funding or creating other legislative hurdles. Despite their potential impact, executive orders have their limitations and cannot be directly overturned by Congress which makes them a unique and strategic aspect of presidential power. Executive orders have been a hallmark of presidential power in the United States, with thousands issued throughout the country’s history. According to data from the American Presidency Project at the University of California, these orders serve as a primary tool for presidents to direct the operations of the federal government and implement key policies. The frequency of executive orders has varied greatly across different administrations. For instance, George Washington, the nation’s first President, signed just eight executive orders. In contrast, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who served from 1933 to 1945, signed a staggering 3,721 executive orders. In more recent times, the number of executive orders has generally been lower. During his first term, President Donald Trump signed 220 executive orders, while President Joe Biden had signed 160 by December 20, 2024. While executive orders are a routine part of the presidency, their frequency often depends on the priorities of the sitting President and the political landscape of the time. These orders remain a powerful means for presidents to enact their vision and influence government operations quickly and without congressional approval.

""It was my honor to help support the creation of DOGE. I'm confident that Elon & team will succeed in streamlining government. I'll have more to say very soon about my future plans in Ohio. Most importantly, we're all-in to help President Trump make America great again,"" Ramaswamy said in a post on X. Vivek Ramaswamy, who is a close confidant of Trump and Vice President JD Vance, was appreciated by Trump in November last year, to be co-leader of DOGE with Elon Musk. In the meantime, the government efficiency advisory group in a statement praised Ramaswamy for his ""critical role"" in helping to form DOGE. ""He intends to run for elected office soon, which requires him to remain outside of DOGE, based on the structure that we announced today. We thank him immensely for his contributions over the last two months and expect him to play a vital role in making America great again,"" Anna Kelly, a spokesperson for the government efficiency advisory group said in a statement. The Washington Post earlier this month reported that Ramaswamy was planning to announce his decision to run for Ohio governor. As reported by the Associated Press, Ramaswamy, who is a biotech entrepreneur has hinted at plans to run for governor of Ohio next year. A native of Cincinnati, Ramaswamy, 39, had shown interest in Vice President JD Vance's recently vacated Senate seat before Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine chose Lt. Gov. Jon Husted as Vance's successor.

The UK recently published its AI Opportunities Action Plan, in which it outlined the broader strategy to position itself as a global leader in AI. The Action Plan has almost 50 recommendations that seek to enhance AI adoption and give a push to economic growth in the country. As the UK is set to relax its visa restrictions, India is poised to benefit the most given the pool of talent it has to offer in the AI domain. Speaking to Business Standard, Ramesh Alluri Reddy, CEO of TeamLease Degree Apprenticeship, said that the AI workforce in India has grown, and the Indian professionals show skills 2.8 times higher than the global average. Due to these factors, India finds itself among the pioneers of data analytics, cloud computing, machine learning, and others. He added that the announcement by the UK government positions India as a key provider of AI talent. The plan, endorsed by British PM Starmer, underscores the need to revise the immigration system, which is aimed at attracting top talent from institutions like Carnegie Mellon University as well as the Indian Institutes of Technology. According to recommendation 21 of the Action Plan, new visa pathways will be developed with an emphasis on addressing barriers, including cost and complexity. Notably, these barriers are known for deterring startups and international talent. In its response, the UK government has revealed that it partially agrees with this recommendation, while it relies on the Industrial Strategy to set out how the country will attract overseas skilled AI talent. The new Action Plan will facilitate easy recruitment of international AI experts by employers in the UK. This will encourage businesses to explore the best talents from different parts of the world, including India.

If the cessation of hostilities is achieved as per the expected lines in the region, peace will follow. Countries, not only the ones located in the region, but also emerging powers like India will be bracing for several opportunities to extend their national interest. Following the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, several projects, including the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) hit a roadblock. The long-awaited peace in the Middle East will have implications for projects that have been planned in the region, and the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) Project is one such initiative. It was signed by eight countries – India, the US, Saudi Arabia, UAE, European Union, France, Germany and Italy on September 9, 2023, in New Delhi. The IMEC project holds significant geopolitical and economic implications for India as it focuses on enhancing global cooperation, becoming part of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII). PGII is a partnership which seeks to achieve values-driven, high-impact, and transparent infrastructure partnerships to meet the enormous infrastructure needs of low and middle-income countries. Speaking to reporters following the ceasefire announcement between the conflicting parties in Gaza, US President Joe Biden also underscored the significance of the IMEC initiative, saying, ""At the G20 in Delhi on September 23, I rallied key countries behind a vision of an economic corridor from India across the Middle East to Europe. That vision can now become a reality."" The IMEC is seen as an alternative to China's One Belt, One Road Initiative as it aims to strengthen transportation and communication links between Europe and Asia through rail and shipping networks. According to a recent report by the Hudson Institute think-tank, the IMEC serves as an example of how India has been instrumental in using multilateral initiatives to pursue its expanding strategic and economic interests. The report says that the IMEC project underscores New Delhi’s proactive approach to regional economic integration and infrastructure development as it is seen as an alternative to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. The report further adds, ""India’s involvement in the negotiations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates that ultimately resulted in the Abraham Accords marks another significant diplomatic shift toward greater flexibility and engagement."" As the ceasefire and the release of hostages, the already unstable Middle East is set to get a respite with Israel likely to stop being a party in an outgoing conflict, India and other countries are expected to move ahead with the IMEC project.

These small, juicy red fruits are not only delicious but also packed with essential nutrients and health benefits. Native to Chile, these cherries have gained popularity all over the world for their unique taste and numerous health benefits. Let's take a closer look at the top 5 benefits of this super fruit. Chilean cherries are a powerhouse of essential vitamins and minerals. They are an excellent source of vitamin C, which helps boost the immune system and promotes healthy skin and hair. These cherries also contain high levels of potassium, an electrolyte that helps regulate blood pressure and supports heart health. Additionally, they are rich in antioxidants, such as anthocyanins, which help fight free radicals and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Chilean cherries are known for their anti-inflammatory properties, making them an ideal fruit for people suffering from chronic inflammation. These cherries contain a compound called quercetin, which has been shown to reduce inflammation in the body. Studies have also found that quercetin can help alleviate symptoms of conditions like arthritis and asthma. If you're looking to shed some extra pounds, incorporating Chilean cherries into your diet can be beneficial. These cherries are low in calories and high in fibre, making you feel full for longer periods and preventing overeating. They also have a low glycemic index, which means they won't cause a spike in blood sugar levels, making them a great snack option for people with diabetes or those watching their sugar intake. Chilean cherries are not just good for your physical health but also your mental health. They are rich in polyphenols, which have been linked to improved memory and cognitive function. These compounds also help protect the brain from age-related degeneration and may reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Digestive problems are a common issue for many people, but luckily, Chilean cherries can help with that. These cherries are a great source of dietary fibre, which is essential for a healthy digestive system. The fibre in these cherries helps regulate bowel movements and promotes the growth of healthy gut bacteria. This can help prevent constipation, bloating, and other digestive issues.

However, people these days have started to add it to every possible food, starting from instant noodles to dosa, pizza and more. While it enhances the taste of some food, it can spoil the taste of others. You should keep a check on what food you're adding it to. Here, we share with you different ways to use mayonnaise in your food other than sandwiches. Adding mayo to the muffin batter improves the texture of the cake. You can also add it to the banana bread batter. Make sure to add the mayo to the wet ingredients. You can also replace the eggs and oil in the recipe with mayo. This is a dessert that is enjoyed by most people and it is better if the cake is moist. You can keep the chocolate cake moist if you add mayo as the base. Also, you can add moisture to your cake by adding a tablespoon of mayonnaise to the wet ingredients. Mayo can be used to coat the chicken before you bake it. This is because mayonnaise has eggs and oil in it which helps to keep the chicken moist. You can also add seasonings of your choice to the mayo and then use it to coat the chicken. When making mashed potato, people usually add milk, cream, butter and other dairy options. While these might be good, you can also add mayo to the mashed potato as it makes it creamier and more flavourful. Also, it helps to improve its texture. Eggs are an important ingredient in this recipe, however, you can also add mayo to the mixture. This makes the dish all the more creamier and smoother.

Likewise, you should be aware that you have to pay tourist tax in some places in addition to the fees you pay for your visa and other things. The main goal of the tourist tax is to reduce the negative effects of tourism like over-tourism that often leads to environmental degradation. The tourist tax is also important to maintain the city's infrastructure and it is also a way to give it back to the local economy. Tourist tax is not a new concept, many cities around the world like Amsterdam, Venice and Bhutan have been charging tourists for years. A few days back Edinburgh announced a 5% mandatory tourist tax that will come into effect from July 2026. Bali provincial government confirmed in December 2024 that it's going to punish travellers who fail to pay the tourism tax. Russia also introduced a new tourist tax starting January 1, 2025, while there are reports that Thailand may reintroduce the INR 750 tourist tax soon. When you are visiting a particular destination, it is always important to do proper research like check if your accommodation includes taxes in the quoted price or whether they will added during check-in or not. At times departure charges may appear as hidden charges; thus, it is essential to learn about the taxes included in flight or ship tickets. Always check for local rules as for day-tripper or entry, taxes may apply even if you are passing through a short period.

The future price of gold for the expiry date of February 5th on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) rose by 0.41% to reach Rs 79,949 per 10 grams today. Concerns in the market regarding policy uncertainties during US President Donald Trump’s tenure are playing a significant role in this rise. Additionally, strong spot demand, the weakness of the rupee, and positive global cues are also supporting gold prices. Gold price opened today with strong rise to breach the bullish channel’s resistance line and head towards resuming the main bullish trend, on its way to achieve gains that start by testing 2790.00$ level. Stochastic current negativity might cause some temporary sideways fluctuation before resuming the positive trades, noting that breaking 2762.00$ will stop the bullish wave and push the price to start bearish wave on the intraday basis.

Trump mentioned that he would pressure the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates. Impact of high-interest rates on gold prices Overall, high-interest rates affect gold prices because they increase the opportunity cost of holding gold instead of investing in interest-bearing assets or keeping cash in the bank. When interest rates are higher, the value of the US dollar typically rises, and since gold is priced in dollars, this results in a decrease in gold prices. Interest rates are applied to loans given by financial institutions to borrowers. They are paid as interest to savers and depositors. These rates are influenced by base lending rates, which are set by central banks in response to changes in the economy.

As per the convention, the Halwa ceremony will be led by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, with Minister of State Pankaj Chaudhary, and secretaries, in attendance. Officers and staff involved in the budget preparation and compilation process will also be present on the occasion. A customary Halwa ceremony is performed every year before the ""lock-in"" process of the budget preparation begins. The Halwa Ceremony is a preparation of the Indian sweet dish in a large 'kadhai' at the North Block. The Finance Minister ceremoniously stirs the 'kadhai' and generally serves the halwa to everyone involved in the Budget-making process. This tradition is also a way to acknowledge the hard work of all the finance ministry officials. The halwa ceremony heralds the process of printing all the budget documents ahead of the presentation in Parliament. The halwa ceremony is a significant event as it also marks the beginning of lockdown at the finance ministry. This means no official is allowed to leave the ministry compound. Everyone part of the Budget team is allowed to leave only after the financial document is presented in Parliament. The printing of the Union Budget inside the basement located at the North Block has become a permanent feature since 1980. The budget session of parliament will begin on January 31 and, according to schedule, will end on April 4. The budget will be presented on February 1. President Droupadi Murmu will address the joint sitting of two houses of Parliament on January 31. Parliament will have an inter-session break from February 14 and the two Houses of Parliament will resume their sittings on March 10. With this upcoming Budget Presentation, Sitharaman will have presented seventh budget. She has already surpassed the record set by former Prime Minister Morarji Desai, who presented five annual budgets and one interim budget between 1959 and 1964 as finance minister. Like the previous few full Union Budgets, the Budget 2025 will also be delivered in paperless form. All eyes will be on the key announcements and the government's forward-looking economic guidance for the remainder of the Modi 3.0 tenure. This upcoming budget comes in the backdrop of weak GDP numbers and weak consumption in the economy. The Indian economy grew by 5.4 per cent in real terms in the July-September quarter of the current financial year 2024-25. The quarterly growth was quite lower than RBI's forecast of 7 per cent. In the April-June quarter too, India's GDP grew at a slower pace than was estimated by its central bank.

Income tax in India is progressive, with higher earners paying more. However, some countries levy little or no income tax, while others have some of the highest tax rates in the world. Here’s a detailed look at tax-free nations and those with steep income tax systems. United Arab Emirates (UAE) The UAE stands out as a tax-free economy. Residents are exempt from personal income tax, and the government relies on indirect taxes such as VAT and oil and tourism revenues to pay for public services. Bahrain Unlike the UAE, Bahrain does not impose an income tax on its citizens. The country also thrives on indirect taxation and fees, creating a favorable environment for startups and small businesses. Kuwait Kuwait's economy relies heavily on oil exports, negating the need for income taxes. Despite being a tax-free country, Kuwait is one of the most prosperous countries in the world. Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia eliminated direct taxes on personal income. Instead, the country benefits from a strong indirect tax system, which provides economic stability and frees its citizens from the burden of income tax. The Bahamas Known as a paradise for tourists, The Bahamas also provides convenience to its citizens by exempting them from income taxes. Tourism and the money associated with it boosts the country's economy. Other tax-free nations There are also notable examples in Oman and Qatar where citizens enjoy tax-free incomes due to strong oil and gas sectors. In contrast, several countries impose high-income tax rates to fund comprehensive social welfare programs, public healthcare, and infrastructure: Interestingly, citizens of high-tax countries, like Finland, often rank as some of the happiest globally. Factors such as social security, efficient governance, and excellent public services contribute to their satisfaction. This global tax perspective sheds light on the diverse economic models that sustain nations, whether through tax-free policies or high-income taxation.

In 2014, India's defence budget was Rs 2.53 lakh crore. A simple comparison between these two budgets hints at an approximate 2.5 times increase in defence expenditure in these 10 years. The budgetary allocation, excluding pensions, saw an increase of 8.6% over the last year. If pensions are included, the growth stands at 7.1%. As India faces adversaries in its northern borders, given Pakistan's hostility and Chinese expansionist designs with geopolitical conflicts persisting in the Middle East and between Russia and Ukraine, India is required to keep the pace that it has maintained in the last ten years. Notably, the growth in the capital budget, which was approximately 15 percent, was a good sign in FY 2024-25. The defence budgets in the last 10 years, particularly last year's budget, focussed on the modernisation of the Armed Forces and the acquisition of new technologies. Notably, the capital expenditure in the 2024-25 budget was 34 per cent of the total defence budget, which the government needs to increase to cater for the change in global geopolitical dynamics and to keep adversaries at bay. Last year, the budgetary allocation under capital head to the Defence Forces for FY 2024-25 was Rs 1.72 lakh crore. According to a report by PwC, last year's budget was INR 4,80,736 crore excluding pensions, which hints at an increase of 8.6% compared to 2023-24’s budget estimates. The total defence budget was Rs 6,21,941 crore, which also marks an increase of 7.1% over last year’s budget estimate. Since India faces the absence of critical technology, the research and development (R&D) budget is likely to get a hike, which currently stands at approximately Rs 13,200 crore. Another significant development in these last 10 years is the government's focus on Aatmanirbharta in defence technology & manufacturing. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) had earmarked 75% of the modernisation budget amounting to Rs 1,05,518.43 crore for procurement through domestic industries during the last financial year.

The day also aims to promote awareness about the rights of a girl child and provide them with support and opportunities. The day was established in 2008 by the Ministry of Women and Child Development. There are different types of problems that are faced by girl children and this includes health issues. There are several health issues that occur at different stages of life. Here are some common health issues suffered by teen girls. Obesity is becoming a significant problem among teen girls due to poor diet, lack of physical activity and sometimes genetics. This can lead to serious health problems in the future such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure. Conditions like anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are extremely common. Teen girls are particularly vulnerable to developing eating disorders due to pressures around body image, social media influence or emotional stress. These conditions can have serious physical and mental health consequences. As teens go through puberty, hormonal fluctuations can lead to various health issues, including irregular periods, severe PMS or painful periods. These changes can sometimes affect appetite, energy levels and mood, which, in turn, can impact eating habits and lead to emotional eating. Teen girls tend to struggle with mental health issues like anxiety, depression and stress. These can affect eating habits, leading to overeating or undereating as a coping mechanism. Due to the pressures of dieting or disordered eating, some teen girls might not get the required nutrients. This can eventually lead to deficiencies such as iron, calcium and vitamin D. Poor nutrition can lead to fatigue, bone health problems, weakened immune systems and other long-term issues.

This can increase the risk of hospitalisation or death due to heart disease, regardless of body mass index (BMI). The study was led by researchers from the Brigham and Women's Hospital, US and published in the European Heart Journal. The researchers found that for every one per cent increase in muscle fat, there was a two per cent increase in coronary microvascular dysfunction and a seven per cent increase in serious heart disease. Coronary microvascular dysfunction is a condition when small blood vessels of the heart start to malfunction. The study says that existing measures such as body mass index or waist circumference are not adequate to evaluate the risk of heart disease accurately for all people. Viviany Taqueti, lead researcher and a director at Brigham and Women's Hospital, said, ""Obesity is now one of the biggest global threats to cardiovascular health, yet body mass index -- our main metric for defining obesity and thresholds for intervention -- remains a controversial and flawed marker of cardiovascular prognosis. This is especially true in women, where high body mass index may reflect more 'benign' types of fat."" Taqueti explained that fat stored in the muscle can lead to inflammation and alter glucose metabolism, thereby, leading to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. These eventually damage blood vessels, including the ones that supply the heart. Taqueti said, ""Intermuscular fat (hidden inside muscles) can be found in most muscles in the body, but the amount of fat can vary widely between different people."" For the study, the researchers examined nearly 670 people with no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease. They were evaluated at the hospital for chest pain and shortness of breath. The researchers calculated fat stored in muscles through the ratio of intermuscular fat to total muscle plus fat, and termed it 'fatty muscle fraction'. The researchers said, ""Increased intermuscular fat is associated with (coronary microvascular dysfunction) and adverse cardiovascular outcomes independently of BMI and conventional risk factors.""

Follow Ayurvedic tips by Swami Ramdev to strengthen your heart,"Published : Jan 23, 2025 11:29 IST, Updated : Jan 23, 2025 11:29 IST","""No man is aware of his death"" Yes, a cricket match was happening in Jalna, Maharashtra. A 30-year-old batting player hit a six and people got up from their seats to clap. But suddenly the player fell to the ground. He had severe pain in his chest. His teammates who were playing the match tried to save him by giving him CPR but he died. This is not the first such case. Such cases come to light every day. After witnessing this it seems that there is no guarantee of life. These days cases of heart attack have become so common that sometimes it is a cricket ground, sometimes a school and sometimes Kumbh Mela, people are losing their lives in seconds. Cases of heart attack and cardiac arrest are seen more frequently in winter. Apart from cold, bad lifestyle, wrong habits and bad eating habits have weakened the heart of people and people are not even aware of this. Especially the youth do not pay any attention to their heart health. According to the Indian Heart Association, 50% of the total cases of heart attack are of people below 50 years of age and 25% of the people are below 40 years of age. Many people do not even know what is the difference between heart attack and cardiac arrest. To understand in simple words, when blood circulation is disturbed, blood is not able to reach the heart due to a clot in the veins, and then a heart attack occurs. Sudden cardiac arrest is caused due to irregular heartbeat and it can lead to death within 8 minutes. But when the heart is strong, you will be able to avoid both heart attack and cardiac arrest. Know from Swami Ramdev how to make the heart strong. To check your heart strength, climb 50-60 stairs in 1 minute. Do 20 sit-ups in a row. Try to remove the lid from the grip test jar. Try to improve your lifestyle. Give up the habit of tobacco and alcohol. Eat healthy food instead of junk food. Do yoga, pranayama, walking, jogging and cycling daily. Share your problems instead of getting stressed. Take 1 teaspoon Arjuna bark, 2 gms cinnamon, 5 Tulsi and make a decoction by boiling all the ingredients. Drinking it every day makes your heart healthy.

This happens when the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin or the body cannot effectively use the insulin that is released. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 14% of adults aged 18 years and older were living with diabetes in 2022. When you know the symptoms of diabetes, it becomes easier to diagnose and treat the problems. Symptoms of diabetes can show up in various ways on your body including your skin. Here, take a look at some of the signs and symptoms of diabetes that can be visible on your skin. When blood sugar is high, your kidneys work harder to remove excess glucose from the blood. This can lead to dehydration which makes your skin dry, thereby, causing itching. Your skin might also feel rough or flaky, especially on the legs, arms or hands. Increased blood sugar levels can affect the body's ability to heal wounds and cuts. If you notice that minor scrapes, cuts or bruises are taking longer than usual to heal, it could be a sign of high blood sugar. This happens because high glucose levels can affect blood circulation and immune function. High blood sugar can weaken the immune system, thereby, making it easier for bacteria and fungi to cause infections. You might notice frequent skin infections, especially fungal ones like athlete’s foot or yeast infections. Another noticeable sign of high blood sugar on your skin is the appearance of dark, velvety patches of skin, usually around the neck, armpits or groin. This happens because of insulin resistance and can be a sign of type 2 diabetes. High blood sugar can lead to inflammation in the body, which may show up as redness, puffiness or irritation on the skin. You might notice areas of your skin becoming inflamed, especially in spots where infection is more likely to occur, like on the feet or underarms.
