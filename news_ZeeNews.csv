New Delhi: Planning parenthood via in vitro fertilization (IVF)? Stay away from outdoor air pollution, suggests a study.
The study showed that exposure to outdoor air pollution can negatively impact human embryo development in IVF cycles.
Researchers from Emory University, US, found that exposure to air pollution at times when a female's ovaries are producing eggs (also known as oocytes) and when a male's testicles are producing sperm can have a negative impact.
“We saw that both maternal and paternal air pollution exposures during gametogenesis have independent, largely detrimental, effects on early embryological outcomes,"" said Audrey Gaskins, lead author and associate professor of epidemiology at Rollins School of Public Health at Emory.
The team conducted research on samples from 500 anonymous oocyte donors and 915 male recipient partners who were all undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) between 2008 and 2019 in the US. Of all the air pollutants examined, ambient exposure to organic carbon appeared to have the most consistent detrimental effect.
Organic carbon is a major element of the hazardous fine particulate matter PM2.5, which is emitted from combustion sources such as vehicle exhaust, industrial processes, and wildfires is bad.
Ambient exposure to organic carbon was found to consistently cause negative impacts on oocyte survival, fertilisation, and embryo quality, revealed the study, published in the journal Environment International.
Both animal and human epidemiological studies have supported the idea that air pollutants cause defects during gametogenesis leading to a drop in reproductive capacities in exposed populations.
""Based on our study and other studies, air pollution is certainly an exposure of concern for those who are seeking to reproduce and conceive. It really should be an important focus to mitigate exposures for these populations, among many other populations,"" Sarah LaPointe, a postdoctoral research student at Rollins.

Trending Photos
Islamabad: Islamabad experienced its most polluted month on record in December 2024, with air quality deteriorating to hazardous levels. The Air Quality Index (AQI) reached 250 on December 22, making the air unhealthy for residents and raising concerns over the city's growing environmental challenges, according to a report by Dawn.
The rise in air pollution has been attributed to rapid urbanization, increasing vehicular emissions, and industrial activities. Dawn cited data from the Islamabad Excise and Taxation Department, which revealed that over a million vehicles have been registered in the city over the past decade, while an additional half a million enter daily.
These vehicles, along with construction activities and emissions from industrial units, contribute significantly to particulate matter (PM2.5) levels, identified as the primary pollutant. Director of Labs at the National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS), Zaigham Abbas, highlighted the role of brick kilns and steel manufacturing units near the city as key contributors to air pollution. While cleaner technologies like zigzag kilns and dry scrubbers have been introduced, their overall impact remains limited.
The worsening air quality has led to an increase in health issues. According to Dawn, Ziaul Haq, a senior pulmonologist at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), reported a rise in respiratory ailments, particularly during the winter months. He advised residents to take precautions such as wearing masks and limiting outdoor activities during high-pollution periods, especially for vulnerable groups.
Despite measures such as banning smoke-emitting vehicles and imposing fines on violators, the authorities have struggled to curb pollution levels. Construction projects, unregulated housing developments, and vehicular emissions continue to exacerbate the issue.
Environmental experts have called for comprehensive solutions. Ejaz Ahmed, Senior Programme Fellow at the Institute of Urbanism, emphasized the need for sustainable urban planning and improved public transportation systems to reduce reliance on private vehicles.
Data from the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) showed that December had five ""very unhealthy"" days, while November recorded two. PM2.5 levels consistently exceeded permissible limits, although other pollutants remained within acceptable ranges.
The rising pollution levels highlight the urgent need for coordinated efforts to improve Islamabad's air quality and mitigate the health risks posed to its residents.

The Commission of Air Quality Management (CAQM) announced the revocation of Stage III restrictions under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) for Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), as air quality improved. The decision follows a positive trend in the Air Quality Index (AQI) readings and favorable weather conditions.
According to the Commission, the AQI readings were recorded as 339 at 4 pm and 335 at 5 pm, with forecasts indicating further improvement. The India Meteorological Department's (IMD) forecast highlighted favorable meteorological conditions, including better wind speed, as the key factors contributing to the declining pollution levels.
As a result, the sub-committee on GRAP held a meeting to revise the previously enforced restrictions.
Stage III restrictions, which include stringent measures like the ban on non-essential construction activities, have now been lifted. Some key measures that were lifted include:
Despite these relaxations, CAQM emphasized that the restrictions under Stage I and II of the GRAP will remain in place to prevent further deterioration of air quality.
While the air quality has shown improvement, the weather in the winter season can be unpredictable, and adverse conditions could cause pollution levels to rise again. The CAQM has urged the public to continue following the restrictions imposed under GRAP-II, particularly as the cold weather can affect the AQI.
The Commission will continue to monitor the situation closely and review air quality regularly for future decisions.
Despite the lifting of restrictions under Stage III, the CAQM made it clear that construction and demolition sites, which had previously been shut down due to violations of environmental guidelines, will remain closed. These sites can only resume operations upon receiving specific orders from the Commission.

The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) announced on December 27, 2024, that the Stage 3 restrictions under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) have been lifted in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) after a noticeable improvement in air quality.
Continuous rainfall since the morning has helped reduce pollution levels, leading to better air quality in the region.
The 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) stood at 324 at 7:00 PM, signaling a shift in Delhi's air quality from the 'severe' to the 'poor' category. The India Meteorological Department and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology have forecasted that the city’s air quality will further improve due to favorable weather conditions.
Under the Stage 3 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), several stringent measures were implemented to control pollution. These included a ban on the operation of BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel four-wheelers in Delhi and surrounding NCR areas like Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, and Noida.
However, with the improvement in air quality, these restrictions have now been revoked.
Additionally, restrictions on the use of diesel generator sets and some curbs on construction activities have been eased. However, the CAQM emphasized that construction and demolition activities cannot resume on sites where closure orders have been issued due to non-compliance with statutory guidelines and rules.
While GRAP-3 restrictions have been lifted, the CAQM confirmed that the curbs under Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the GRAP will remain in place. The body stressed that strict monitoring and implementation of these measures will continue to prevent further deterioration of air quality.
The CAQM stated, “We are taking every precaution to ensure AQI levels do not deteriorate. Vigilance and strict implementation of Stage I and II measures will continue,” to maintain the improving air quality.
According to the air quality and weather forecast provided by the India Meteorological Department and IIT Madras, the AQI in Delhi is expected to remain in the 'poor' category, with values ranging between 200 and 300, for the next few days.
The forecast suggests that air quality will continue to improve in the coming days due to the ongoing favorable weather conditions.

The air quality in Delhi has reached alarming levels, with the 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) soaring to 409 on Sunday, categorizing it as ‘severe.’ This follows a previous reading of 370 on Saturday, which placed the city’s air quality in the ‘very poor’ category.
The deteriorating air quality has led to the activation of Stage 4 curbs under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) for the winter season.
The AQI scale categorizes air quality as follows: 0-50 is considered 'good', 51-100 is 'satisfactory', 101-200 is 'moderate', 201-300 is 'poor', 301-400 is 'very poor', and 401-500 is 'severe'.
An AQI of 409, falling into the 'severe' category, indicates that the air quality poses significant health risks for the entire population, especially for those with pre-existing respiratory conditions, children, and the elderly.
Prolonged exposure to such pollution levels can cause serious health complications, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
In response to the worsening air quality, Stage 4 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) has been triggered. This stage involves stricter restrictions aimed at reducing pollution levels and mitigating health hazards.
One of the key measures is the ban on the entry of trucks carrying non-essential goods into Delhi, which helps reduce vehicular emissions, a major contributor to air pollution in the city.
Another significant impact of the Stage 4 restrictions is the mandatory shift in school operations. Under the GRAP, classes for students in grades VI to IX and XI across Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, and Gautam Buddh Nagar must now operate in hybrid mode.
This means that students will attend classes both physically and online, reducing their exposure to the hazardous outdoor air.
In addition, classes for grades up to V have also been moved to hybrid mode under Stage 3 of GRAP, with parents and students being given the flexibility to choose online education wherever possible. However, students in grades X and XII are exempted from the shift and will continue attending school in person.

Delhi experienced another day of hazardous air on Wednesday as the city’s overall Air Quality Index (AQI) soared beyond 440, placing it in the ‘severe’ category. According to reports,  several monitoring stations recorded even more alarming levels in the ‘severe-plus’ category At 7 a.m. despite the implementation of Stage 4 anti-pollution measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).
Data from the Sameer app, which provides real-time AQI updates, revealed that out of 37 monitoring stations in Delhi, 21 recorded air quality in the ‘severe-plus’ category on Wednesday morning.
Some of the most affected areas included:
This is first instance since mid-November when Delhi’s air quality has entered the severe-plus category.
The rapidly declining air quality prompted authorities to reintroduce Stage 4 restrictions under GRAP on Monday night. These measures include:  
- A ban on all construction and demolition activities.  
- Prohibition of truck entry into the city, except for those carrying essential goods.
Experts attribute the sudden spike in pollution levels to a sharp decline in wind speeds. Slower winds trap local pollutants in the atmosphere, leading to higher pollutant concentrations near the ground.
Despite the restrictions, the situation highlights the urgent need for more effective and sustainable strategies to combat air pollution in Delhi.

New Delhi: While the rapid spread of Covid-19 can be attributed mainly to the high transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a new study has linked the high incidence and mortality rates with environmental factors, particularly with PM2.5.
Researchers from the National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taiwan proposed the theory that PM2.5 influenced the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent severity of the disease.
Many previous studies have demonstrated a correlation between the morbidity of Covid-19 and air pollution levels. The studies hinted that PM2.5 may act as an environmental carrier facilitating the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
The novel research, published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials, in mice, found that PM2.5 instillation induced the protein abundance of ACE2 -- the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 -- and then increased SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in vitro and in vivo.
“Our current results provide the first in vitro and in vivo evidence that PM2.5 exposure increased ACE2 expression and deteriorated SARS-CoV-2 infection. PM2.5 instillation dysregulated the expression of RAS proteins, increased the protein abundance of ACE and ACE2 in the lungs of mice, and upregulated the morbidity of SARS-CoV-2,” the team said in the paper.
Another recent study, published in Environmental Health Perspectives, linked air pollution with longer duration of long Covid symptoms like fatigue, breathlessness, and cognitive issues.
Researchers from the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) in Spain showed that air pollution can impact the severity of acute infection. As a result, exposure to PM2a.5 and PM10 can raise the risk of persistent long-Covid symptoms.
While air pollution was not directly responsible for long-Covid, it could increase the severity of the initial infection, which, in turn, raises the risk of long Covid, the researchers noted.

Delhi Air Pollution: As Delhi grapples with deteriorating air quality due to unfavourable weather conditions, the Centre's air quality panel for Delhi-NCR on Monday imposed the strictest Stage 4 curbs under the winter air pollution control plan.
The plan includes a ban on all construction activities, as the region's air quality deteriorated to 'severe' due to unfavourable weather conditions. During the winter season, stage 4 curbs under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) also include a ban on the entry of polluting trucks carrying non-essential goods into Delhi and mandatory shifting of school classes, except those for X and XII, to hybrid mode.
The urgent step to impose Stage 4 curbs was prompted by the major drop in AQI, which breached the 400 mark on Monday night. Delhi's 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) was 379 at 4 pm.
The air quality in the national capital dropped amid extremely calm wind conditions and the buildup of an inversion layer, which adversely affects the vertical mixing height—the height up to which pollutants can disperse.
The decision to further step up anti-pollution measures came just hours after the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) implemented restrictive measures under GRAP Stage 3, after AQI in Delhi breached the 350 mark in the afternoon.
According to the revised GRAP schedule, classes for students in grades VI-IX and XI in Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, and Gautam Buddh Nagar must operate in hybrid mode (physical and online) under Stage 4.
Classes up to grade V are required to shift to hybrid mode under Stage 3. Parents and students have the option to choose online education wherever available. Stage 4 also includes a ban on all construction and demolition activities, including public projects like highways, flyovers, power lines, and pipelines. Non-essential diesel trucks are prohibited from entering Delhi.
Public, municipal, and private offices must decide on allowing only 50 percent of staff to work in offices, with the remaining staff working from home. States may consider additional measures like closing colleges and non-essential businesses and implementing odd-even vehicle restrictions.
Under Stage 3, imposed earlier in the day, the use of BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel cars (4-wheelers) is restricted in Delhi and nearby NCR districts. Persons with disabilities are exempt. Stage 3 also bans non-essential diesel-operated medium goods vehicles with BS-IV or older standards in Delhi.
During winters, Delhi enforces restrictions under GRAP, which categorises air quality into four stages: Stage I (Poor, AQI 201-300), Stage II (Very Poor, AQI 301-400), Stage III (Severe, AQI 401-450), and Stage IV (Severe Plus, AQI above 450).

Delhi Air Pollution: In view of the sharp drop in the air quality in the national capital following unfavourable meteorological conditions, the air quality panel of the Central government on Monday invoked restrictive measures under stage three of the air pollution control plan.
This decision comes as the AQI in Delhi stood at 367 at 2 pm. The poor air quality is caused by unfavourable weather conditions. It often persists from November to January.
""Considering the highly unfavourable meteorological conditions, including calm winds and very low mixing height leading the AQI of Delhi into the higher end of the very poor category, the panel's sub-committee on Graded Response Action Plan decides to impose stage 3 of the revised GRAP schedule (issued on Friday) in the entire NCR, with immediate effect,"" an official order said, as quoted by news agency ANI.
As per the revised plan, schools and colleges in Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, and Gautam Budh Nagar are mandatorily required to shift classes up to Class V to hybrid mode under GRAP Stage III.
Students and parents will have the option to choose online education wherever it is available.
As per the rules under Stage 3, a ban is imposed on nonessential diesel-operated medium goods vehicles with BS-IV or older standards within Delhi. Non-essential diesel light commercial vehicles of BS-IV or older standards, registered outside Delhi, are also not allowed to enter the city. Previously, such restrictions were applicable only to BS-III vehicles.
Persons with disabilities are exempt from restrictions imposed on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel cars in Delhi and the districts of Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, and Gautam Budh Nagar under stage III.
The Delhi and NCR state governments have also been directed to stagger timings for public offices and municipal bodies under stage III. The Centre may decide on similar staggered timings for central government offices in Delhi-NCR.
During the winter season, the national capital often enforces restrictions under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which categorizes air quality into four stages—Stage I (Poor) with AQI between 201 and 300, Stage II (Very Poor) between 301 and 400, Stage III (Severe) between 401 and 450, and Stage IV (Severe Plus) for AQI above 450.

Delhi Air Pollution: As coldwave grips parts of North India, the residents in Delhi woke up to a chilly morning on Thursday. The city recorded the lowest temperature of this winter season so far, with the minimum dipping to 4.5 degrees Celsius.
Cold wave conditions were observed at isolated places in the national capital, including Ayanagar and Pusa, where temperatures dropped to 3.8 and 3.2 degrees Celsius, respectively.
According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), cold wave conditions occur when actual temperatures fall below 4.1 degrees Celsius or when the departure from normal is 4.4 degrees Celsius or more below average. A thin layer of fog covered parts of Delhi this morning as the minimum temperature dropped to 4 degrees Celsius, as per IMD.
As far as air quality is concerned, the air quality in the national capital again took a turn for the worse and dropped to “poor” on Thursday morning. On Wednesday, the minimum temperature in the national capital stood at 4.9 degrees Celsius.
The minimum temperatures in early December have been recorded below 5 degrees Celsius for the first time in 14 years, the weather department had said. According to data, the lowest minimum temperature during this period was recorded on December 6, 1987, at 4.1 degrees Celsius.
The decline in the air quality follows a moderate air quality reading, on average, over the past 24 hours, with a reading taken at 4 pm on December 11. Unfortunately, Delhi has been grappling with severe air pollution for the past month. According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s AQI, the average air quality in the national capital was 259 and has been categorized as 'poor.'
According to the CPCB data, Delhi's air quality levels were recorded at 274 in Punjabi Bagh, 282 in Rohini, and 289 in RK Puram. Other areas such as Major Dhyan Chand Station reported an AQI of 245, Najafgarh recorded 224, Nehru Nagar had 310, and North Campus, DU, had 206.
On Wednesday, air quality in Delhi improved to moderate at 4 PM after it remained in the 'poor' category during morning hours. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has revoked the stringent GRAP Stage IV and III restrictions in Delhi-NCR, following the Supreme Court's permission to relax these restrictions to GRAP Stage II.
The decision came after AQI in Delhi-NCR showed significant improvement, with the average AQI reading dropping to 165, categorized as 'moderate.'
As a result, several restrictions imposed under Stage 4 have been lifted, including the ban on diesel-run medium and heavy vehicles (BS-IV or below) registered in Delhi, except those carrying essential goods.
However, restrictions under GRAP Stage II will remain in force, including a ban on the use of coal and firewood, including tandoors at hotels, restaurants, and open eateries.
The CAQM will continue to monitor the air quality and may reinstate stricter measures if the AQI levels deteriorate. Citizens are advised to strictly adhere to the citizen charter and take necessary precautions to minimize pollution.

Authorities' crackdown on air pollution has hit violators hard in the city, with over Rs 260 crore in fines imposed on more than 2.6 lakh vehicles lacking Pollution Under Control Certificates (PUCC) in just 50 days. The crackdown was implemented under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).
Between October 16 and December 6, the Environment Department issued 260,258 challans across all four stages of GRAP. Breaking down the time period and stages, a total of 12,756 challans were imposed in Stage 1 from October 16 to October 22, 111,235 in Stage 2 between October 22 and November 14, 13,938 in Stage 3 from November 15 to November 17, and 114,089 in Stage 4 from November 18 to December 5.
Meanwhile, 8,240 challans were issued in Stage 2 after Stage 4 restrictions were lifted on Thursday, with Stage 2 restrictions remaining in effect, according to official data. A fine of Rs 10,000 is imposed on motorists for not having a valid pollution under control (PUC) certificate.
Delhi's air quality reached alarming levels on November 17 when the AQI touched 450, entering the severe-plus category for the first time this year. In response, the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region (CAQM) escalated the situation to Stage IV restrictions, the strictest level of action under GRAP.
Stage IV restrictions came into force on the morning of November 18, when AQI levels reached a hazardous 494 – the city's second-worst air quality in six years. The spike triggered a complete ban on non-essential trucks entering the city, except for those carrying essential goods or using clean fuel, including LNG, CNG, BS-VI diesel, or electric vehicles. Non-essential light commercial vehicles from outside Delhi were also banned, with exemptions for EVs and CNG/BS-VI diesel vehicles.
The implementation of Stage IV saw the highest number of fines issued for traffic violations, with a total of 114,089 challans between November 18 and December 5. Meanwhile, from December 6 to 7, as Stage 4 restrictions were lifted and Stage 2 measures were put in place, 8,240 challans were issued.
In total, 11,427 overaged vehicles were impounded under various stages of GRAP. The highest number of fines was recorded under Stage 2, with 5,346 overaged vehicles impounded between October 22 and November 14.
This was followed by 3,679 vehicles impounded during Stage 4 restrictions from November 18 to December 5, according to official data.
The restrictions also targeted the flow of non-destined trucks into Delhi. During the enforcement period, 104,768 trucks were diverted through the Eastern and Western Peripheral Roads.
However, after Stage 4 restrictions were lifted on December 6, the number of non-destined trucks diverted to Delhi dropped to zero.
First implemented in 2017, the GRAP is a set of anti-air pollution measures followed in the capital and its vicinity according to the severity of the situation.
It classifies the air quality in the Delhi-NCR under four different stages: Stage 1 - 'poor' (AQI 201-300), Stage 2 - 'very poor' (AQI 301-400), Stage 3 - 'severe' (AQI 401-450) and Stage 4 - 'severe plus' (AQI above 450).

Delhi-NCR is currently struggling with severe pollution, with the AQI in many areas surpassing 349. This situation remains extremely critical, leading to school closures and the implementation of various restrictions. Air pollution has become an overlooked and serious crisis. Due to the increasing pollution, not only are respiratory issues on the rise, but heart-related problems are also becoming more prevalent.
Air pollution is often referred to as a ""silent killer"" because the toxic particles in the air are gradually harming our bodies, especially for those with weak immune systems or pre-existing health conditions. This growing issue is leading to a rapid increase in respiratory and heart diseases, creating a dangerous situation.
Dr. P.N. Arora, Chairman of Yashoda Super Specialty Hospital, Kaushambi, stated, ""Air pollution negatively impacts the respiratory system. Pollutants enter the respiratory tract and cause diseases like asthma and bronchitis. Additionally, pollution also affects the heart and blood vessels. Air pollution causes inflammation in the blood vessels, leading to their hardening and causing circulation problems.""
Dr. Arora further explained, ""Pollution is also contributing to an increase in heart attacks, high blood pressure, and strokes. The micro-particles in the air raise blood pressure, which puts additional strain on the heart and blood vessels. Therefore, the effects of pollution are not limited to the respiratory system alone; it also impacts heart health.""
To protect oneself from the harmful effects of air pollution, Dr. Arora recommended several preventive measures. He advised ensuring clean air at home by using air purifiers and keeping windows closed, especially during periods of high pollution. Maintaining a healthy diet rich in Vitamin C and antioxidants is essential to boost the immune system and provide protection against pollution.
Dr. Arora also emphasized the importance of exercise and spending time outdoors for fresh air, but only when the air quality is safe. Furthermore, regular health check-ups for heart and respiratory conditions are crucial, particularly for those living in areas with high pollution levels, to monitor and manage any potential health issues.
Dr. Arora also emphasized that the government must take strict measures to reduce pollution to minimize the impact of this ""silent killer."" This problem cannot be solved by individual efforts alone; collective action and spreading awareness are essential for all of us to address this issue together.

Delhi Air Quality: Amid the persisting air pollution in the national capital from the last few weeks, the air quality remained in the ‘poor category’ in several parts across Delhi on Saturday, as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).
A thin layer of smog engulfed several areas around Delhi-NCR, including India Gate and Barapulla.
However, in some areas across the national capital, the air quality was recorded in the ‘moderate’ category. According to CPCB, AQI in Anand Vihar was recorded at 299, Ashok Vihar 221, Aya Nagar 150, Bawana 263, DTU 21, IGI Airport (T3) 211.
The CPCB classifies AQI levels between 0 and 50 as ""good,"" between 51 and 100 as ""satisfactory,"" between 101 and 200 as ""moderate,"" between 201 and 300 as ""poor,"" between 301 and 400 as ""very poor,"" and above 400 as ""severe."".
Earlier this week, the Supreme Court took note of the improving Air Quality Index (AQI) levels in Delhi and adjoining areas and permitted the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to ease the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) Stage-IV restrictions to GRAP Stage-II. However, the bench, headed by Justice Abhay S. Oka, said that it would not be appropriate to allow the CAQM to go below GRAP-II restrictions at this stage. It suggested that the CAQM may consider incorporating certain additional measures which are part of Stage-III.
The bench, also comprising Justice A.G. Masih, took note of the submission made by Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati that in the last four days, the AQI levels have come below 300. The apex court told CAQM to impose GRAP-III restrictions if the AQI crosses 350 and GRAP-IV measures if the AQI goes above 400 in the coming time.

Delhi Air Pollution: After the Supreme Court eased the anti-pollution measures in the national capital, the Delhi government issued an order directing all the government and private schools in Delhi to resume physical classes with immediate effect. This decision comes after the Supreme Court allowed the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to implement the Graded Response Action Plan-II (GRAP) restrictions.
After the Directorate of Education (DoE) issued a circular, all government and private schools in the national capital are set to resume physical classes with immediate effect. As per the Delhi government order, all the government and private schools in Delhi can conduct classes in physical mode with immediate effect.
""All government, government-aided, and unaided recognized private schools under the DoE, NDMC, MCD, and Delhi Cantonment Board are required to conduct all classes in physical mode with immediate effect,"" the circular said. The in-person classes were shifted to online mode on November 17 except for classes 10 and 12, due to the 'severe plus' air quality index in the national capital.
However, on November 18, offline classes for classes 10 and 12 were also moved online. The Centre's air quality panel for Delhi-NCR revoked restrictive pollution control measures under stages 3 and 4 of the anti-pollution control plan for winters, as per an official order.
The restrictions have been reduced to Stage 2 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) which involves less stringent curbs such as a ban on the use of coal and firewood in industries and commercial establishments, including eateries.
On Thursday, the apex court allowed the relaxation of stage 4 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) measures, which was in force to tackle the severe air quality in Delhi. Following the relaxation given by the top court, the government will take a call soon on lifting the bans from certain activities.
The government may lift the ban on truck entry and a temporary halt on construction at public projects. The authorities can also allow physical classes in schools and colleges. Despite the easing of some restrictions, certain measures remain in effect under Stage Two.
The use of coal and firewood, including tandoors in hotels, restaurants, and open eateries, continues to be prohibited. Noting that the AQI level in the National Capital Region (NCR) did not cross 300 in the last four days, the top court told the CAQM that stage-3 curbs would be introduced if AQI crossed the 350 mark and stage-4 curbs if AQI crossed 400.

Delhi Air Quality: As Delhi continues to reel under bad air quality, the Air Quality Index (AQI) in the national capital Delhi was recorded in the 'poor' category on Wednesday for the third day in a row.
According to the Central Pollution Control Board, the AQI was measured as '211' at 8 am. In the drone visuals, a thin layer of smog was seen. It engulfed the areas of Bikaji Cama, Moti Bagh, and AIIMS. In the visuals, locals were seen jogging at the India Gate in large numbers after the pollution levels showed a slight improvement, as reported by news agency ANI.
Anmol, a local, expressed his happiness on the decrease in the pollution and said that he was able to resume his daily activities. ""The pollution levels have decreased significantly. We are able to resume our daily activities now. This is a positive sign,"" Anmol told ANI. Another local said that the visibility had become better in the national capital after the pollution had reduced.
""The visibility has become slightly better now. You can see the India Gate and the Rashtrapati Bhavan properly now,"" said the local resident taking a stroll at the India Gate. AQI in some areas of the national capital was recorded as moderate. 161 at ITO, 190 at Alipur, 181 at Chandni Chowk, and 197 at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium at 8 a.m.
However, the AQI in some areas still stood in the 'poor' category. Ashok Vihar's AQI was recorded as 222, 218 at Lodhi Road, and 216 at Patparganj. An AQI between 0-50 is considered good, 51-100 is satisfactory, 101-200 is moderate, 201-300 is poor, 301-400 is very poor, and 401-500 is severe.
Earlier on Monday, the Supreme Court said 'no' to relaxing Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)-IV measures to curb air pollution in the national capital. The apex court had also stated that it will hear the parties on this aspect on the next date of hearing.
The apex court also clarified that it will permit relaxations only after observing a downward trend and said that it will hear the parties on Thursday on the aspects of modification of the applicability of GRAP IV.

This poor air quality causes serious health problems, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, especially for children and the elderly.
In Delhi, harmful pollutants like PM2.5, PM10 and gases such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are prevalent, especially during winter. These fine particles, mainly from vehicle emissions, industrial activity and crop burning, pose significant health risks, causing respiratory issues, heart disease and aggravating pre-existing conditions. According to aqicn.org, these are the pollutants found in the National Capital.
PM2.5 refers to fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers, which can penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream, causing serious health problems like respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
PM10 refers to particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less. These particles can be inhaled into the lungs, causing respiratory issues, allergies, and worsening heart conditions.
Ozone (O3) is a gas composed of three oxygen molecules. While it protects the Earth from harmful UV radiation in the upper atmosphere ground-level ozone is a harmful air pollutant, causing respiratory problems and aggravating conditions like asthma. It forms when pollutants from vehicles and industries react with sunlight.
Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a harmful gas produced by vehicle emissions, industrial processes and power plants. It contributes to air pollution, leading to respiratory issues, asthma, and environmental damage like acid rain.
Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a toxic gas produced by burning fossil fuels, industrial activities and volcanic eruptions. It can cause respiratory problems, aggravate asthma and contribute to acid rain formation.
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas produced by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. It can cause headaches, dizziness, and even death, especially in poorly ventilated areas. (Images: ANI)

Air pollution has increasingly become a significant issue that poses serious health risks to everyone, but it affects children the most. Kids are more vulnerable to pollutants due to their developing respiratory systems, making it essential to take extra precautions. Here are some tips for parents to protect their children from the harmful effects of air pollution and keep them healthy and safe.
To protect your child, it is crucial to stay informed about air quality levels in your area. Several apps and websites provide real-time updates on the Air Quality Index (AQI). When the air quality is poor, limit outdoor activities for your child, ensuring they stay indoors as much as possible to avoid exposure to harmful pollutants.
Air pollution levels tend to rise in the early morning and late evening, especially in areas with heavy traffic or industrial activity. To minimize exposure, keep outdoor play and activities to midday or late afternoon when air quality is often better. Instead, encourage indoor activities like puzzles, arts and crafts, or reading.
Air purifiers with HEPA filters are effective in removing dust, pollen, and other airborne pollutants inside your home. Make sure to regularly clean or replace the filters to ensure maximum efficiency. Air purifiers can help create a cleaner environment for children, especially when they are indoors during high-pollution days.
If your child has to go outside on days with high pollution, it is essential to use protective gear. N95 or N99 masks are designed to filter out fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and other harmful pollutants. Ensure that the mask fits securely and is comfortable for your child, especially during outdoor activities like walking to school or playing.
Indoor air quality can also affect your child's health, so it’s essential to maintain a clean environment at home. Vacuum frequently using a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter, and wipe down surfaces with a damp cloth to prevent dust buildup. Avoid using harsh chemical cleaners or air fresheners, which can release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the air.
A balanced diet plays a significant role in strengthening your child's immune system. Provide foods rich in antioxidants and vitamins like Vitamin C (found in citrus fruits) and Vitamin E (found in nuts and seeds). A healthy diet helps your child’s body combat the effects of pollution, improving their ability to fight off respiratory illnesses.
Breathing exercises can help improve lung capacity and strengthen respiratory health. Teach your child simple exercises like deep breathing or blowing into balloons to help them practice lung expansion. These activities are not only beneficial for their overall health but also fun for them to do.
Traffic is a significant source of pollution, especially in urban areas. Try to avoid taking your child on walks or bike rides near busy roads, construction zones, or high-traffic areas. If you need to commute, keep car windows closed and use air conditioning in recirculation mode to minimize exposure to pollutants.
Teaching your children about the dangers of air pollution in an age-appropriate way helps them understand the importance of protecting themselves. Encourage habits that reduce pollution, like using public transport, reducing waste, and planting trees. When kids are aware of the issue, they become more responsible and can take small steps to protect the environment.
As a parent, you can advocate for cleaner air by supporting local environmental policies and taking part in community initiatives. Encourage others to reduce their carbon footprint, and speak up for policies that protect children's health. Collective action can lead to cleaner air and a safer environment for future generations.
Although air pollution is an ever-growing concern, taking the right steps to protect your child can significantly reduce the impact on their health. By monitoring air quality, encouraging healthy habits, and maintaining a clean environment, you can help safeguard your child’s future. These small, consistent actions will allow them to breathe easier and stay healthy, no matter what the air quality is like.

Amid poor air quality in the national capital, doctors on Friday warned that the air pollutants, besides causing respiratory and cardiovascular issues, can also lead to weight gain, contribute to rising obesity rates, and also affect hormonal health.
The air quality in Delhi-NCR on Friday morning was reported to be in the ‘very poor’ category with a thin layer of smog engulfing the region. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Delhi's average air quality index (AQI) at 7.15 a.m. remained at 371.
In seven areas of Delhi, the AQI level remained above 400 and between 450. The AQI was 410 in Anand Vihar, 411 in Bawana, 426 in Jahangirpuri, 402 in Mundka, 410 in Nehru Nagar, 402 in Shadipur, and 413 in Wazirpur.
“Air pollution can affect weight gain by altering metabolism and can also affect hormonal health. Air pollution causes metabolic disorders that can lead to weight gain. It can also cause inflammation which leads to obesity,” Dr. Shailly Sharma, Senior Consultant and Associate Director, Obstetrician and gynaecologist, at Cloudnine Hospital, told IANS.
“Air pollution can precipitate sedentary behaviour because it can cause certain respiratory symptoms like coughing, and shortness of breath, which can restrict physical activity and precipitate weight gain. It also increases insulin resistance, leading to weight gain and obesity,” Sharma said.
Recent studies show that prolonged exposure to air pollution which contains particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide, could lead to systemic inflammation and metabolic disturbances -- key in weight gain and obesity.
A meta-analysis published in BMC Public Health in July found that air pollution can impact metabolic function by influencing inflammation in fat tissue, increasing oxidative stress, and altering individual dietary habits.
Breathing toxic air affects immune function and breathing pathways. This raises inflammation markers and increases oxidative stress.
Dr. Vikas Mittal, Pulmonologist and director, Department of Respiratory Medicine, CK Birla Hospital told IANS that while there have been reports about air pollution affecting metabolism, leading to metabolic syndrome and obesity, the exact mechanism by which air pollution affects metabolism and hormonal health is not known.
“It could be because air pollution is an irritant and it can cause inflammation in the airways, and then leads to the secretion of inflammatory markers in the body and blood, which then affects various organs, and thus can lead to increase the change in the hormonal milieu and increase in the pro-inflammatory markers. This can lead to worsening of cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes -- an important part of anybody having metabolic syndrome,” the doctor explained.
Studies have shown that long-term exposure to the pollutants in the air can disrupt hormones, causing imbalance and also leading to reduced conception rates and overall fertility.

Trending Photos
In select geographies, especially in urban environments, air pollution has become a pressing matter — leading to innovative solutions.
Air purifiers have emerged as one of the most sought-after solutions to tackle this environmental challenge, as the growing emphasis to breathe clean air indoors is taking precedence among increasingly health-conscious customers.
Prashant Bora, MD & CEO of OTEK shares how air purifiers impact to avoid air pollution in urban environment.
The shift towards purchasing air purifiers can be attributed to increased fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in indoor settings. PM2.5 is directly associated with heightened air pollution, which leads to reduced quality of air across the world. Recent studies reveal that people spend up to 90% of their time indoors in urban areas (home, workplace etc.), highlighting the adverse effects of PM2.5 in indoor environments. As per the World Health Organization (WHO), indoor air pollution can be 10 times higher than outside, leading to up to 4% of all health complications globally, resulting in the death of 20 lakh individuals yearly. Furthermore, studies have shown that indoor air pollution results in monetary losses of up to $10.7 billion yearly across the world — highlighting the importance of installing air purifiers in urban environments.
Implication of air pollution on health 
Smoking, cooking, burning incense sticks and outdoor air pollution are some of the leading reasons for indoor air pollution in India. Researchers suggest that the origin of 75% of indoor PM2.5 can be attributed to sources from outside. However, coupled with the sources from inside, air pollution rises significantly in indoor settings — leading to an enhanced requirement for air purifiers. In these scenarios, natural ventilation offers little help to address this challenge and air purifiers become the most efficient approach for purification. Different air purification processes like filtration, negative ion purification and electrostatic purification offer extensive protection from air pollution, leading to streamlined health.
Furthermore, India has been facing a considerable rise in respiratory health challenges like asthma and COPD in recent years. Numerous factors like stubble burning, transportation, construction and others are some of the largest contributors to this phenomenon. For example, 1.5 crore Indians become victims of COPD every year, resulting in as many as 5 lakh deaths. Additionally, India boasts of between 2-3 crore asthma patients, a large number of whom are children aged under 11. Other respiratory diseases like Bronchitis are also increasing in India — with the population having little to no means to address this issue.
Role of air purifiers
To tackle the rising threat of air pollution in indoor settings in urban environments, installing appropriate air purifiers can be impactful. A recent study shows that the efficacy of air purifiers depends highly on having multi-level filters. The air purifiers with 3-stage filters helped to capture up to 99.96% of pollutants with sizes down to 0.3 micrometres to ensure clean and healthy air. This process was further supplemented by innovative features like Anion Generator, Hepa 11 filter and UV light disinfectant — aspects that could provide end-users with clean air in indoor settings and healthy breathing. These features also help air purifiers to safeguard users from foul smells, smoke fumes and PM2.5 particles, directly translating to healthy breathing indoors.
Recent studies also support this notion, revealing air purifiers play an active role in capturing considerable allergens and dust particles to support respiratory health. Clinical studies also stress the usage of HEPA air filters, especially for adult individuals suffering from asthma. This leads to a comprehensive transformation of air quality in indoor settings, particularly in urban environments, leaving a favourable impact on respiratory and cardiovascular health. Air purifiers also help to reduce oxidative stress and systemic inflammation, thus mitigating additional health risks.
Future outlook
While authorities are actively working towards addressing environmental concerns like air pollution, era-appropriate measures are imperative to protect indoor air quality. In an emerging country like India where industrialisation is still considered at a nascent stage, air pollution is expected to rise and spread to more regions. This phenomenon is leading to a comprehensive growth of the electronics industry, a critical enabler of manufacturing innovative air purifying solutions, especially in indoor areas.

Trending Photos
The Supreme Court of India has expressed concern over the lack of effective implementation of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) Stage 4 restrictions in Delhi, which were necessary to curb severe air pollution levels in the National Capital Region (NCR).
The court's intervention comes after the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi spiked to hazardous levels earlier this week, triggering the need for stricter pollution control measures.
During a hearing on Friday, the Supreme Court questioned the Delhi government's ability to enforce the GRAP Stage 4 restrictions effectively. The bench, led by Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih, noted that it was ""very difficult"" to assume that truck entries were being fully prevented, despite the stringent guidelines in place.
The court further pointed out that the Delhi government and city police had failed to ensure that heavy vehicles, including those registered outside Delhi and not carrying essential items, were not allowed into the capital.
To verify this, the court directed authorities to submit CCTV footage from 13 major entry points into Delhi, to confirm whether trucks had been permitted to enter despite the ban.
In a bid to hold authorities accountable, the Supreme Court appointed 13 lawyers to visit the 13 key entry points and submit a report by November 25, detailing whether the GRAP Stage 4 restrictions were being adhered to.
The court also suggested that police personnel be deployed at these points to monitor and prevent the entry of heavy and light commercial vehicles (LCVs) that do not carry essential goods.
The investigation is expected to shed light on the true extent of non-compliance and provide a clearer picture of the enforcement failures in Delhi.
Stage 4 of the GRAP, implemented when the AQI surpasses the 'severe-plus' category (AQI > 450), includes measures such as a ban on the entry of heavy vehicles and a halt to construction activities in public projects. The aim is to reduce vehicular emissions and dust pollution, which contribute significantly to the deterioration of air quality in the capital.
The Delhi AQI hit a critical 457 on Sunday, rising further to 485 by Monday morning, well above the threshold for GRAP Stage 4 to take effect. However, the Supreme Court pointed out serious lapses in the enforcement of these restrictions, particularly regarding the entry of trucks and commercial vehicles.
Earlier in the week, the Supreme Court had highlighted the constitutional duty of the central and state governments to ensure that citizens live in a pollution-free environment.
The court had expressed frustration over the delay in implementing the GRAP, especially Stage 3 and Stage 4 measures, which should have been enforced even in anticipation of the AQI crossing hazardous levels.
The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) came under criticism from the court for its delayed response. The bench asserted that waiting for improvement in the AQI before enforcing the necessary measures was an inappropriate approach. Immediate action, the court stressed, was needed to curb the pollution crisis

The air quality index (AQI) is alarmingly rising and there is an increase in the harmful pollutants in the air that trigger respiratory tract issues. The question remains - are air masks really beneficial to deal with the effects of these damaging pollutants? Dr Harish Bhatia, Founder Director Rebreathe Clinic Senior Consultant Chest specialist & Physician with Apollo Hospital, Corona Warrior & TB champion award recipient shares his inputs with Zee News Digital and shares how masks can help combat air pollution.
Air pollution occurs when there is suspension of solid, liquid or gaseous pollutants in the air coming from vehicle exhaust, industrial emissions etc. The most concerning environmental pollutants include nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM2.5 and 10), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) etc. PM2.5 is really devastating for our respiratory tract as its small size makes it penetrate the blood easily.
The work of air masks are to act as a filter for harmful air pollutants and stop them from entering into the respiratory tract of the human body. These masks are mostly comprised of three layers - the outermost layer supporting the role of filtering out large pollutants such as dust etc., filter layer that are made of fine fibers to block the entry of smaller pollutants such as PM2.5 and the innermost layer designed to absorb moisture from the breath and provide comfortable breathing.
Depending upon the type of mask, its effectiveness in filtering out pollutants varies.
(1) Surgical masks - These masks are valid only up to the hospital settings as they work well to sort out large sized particles but not smaller pollutants. Hence, they do not serve the purpose of protection from air pollution. 
(2) Cloth masks - They do not fulfil any requirement when it comes to safeguarding from air pollution as they give minimum protection and by no way sort out small particles such as PM2.5. 
(3) N95 masks - These masks work wonders to protect our nasal cavity from air pollutants by 95 percent filtering out of particulate matter. 
(4) KN95 masks - Under the circumstances of unavailability of N95 masks, these Chinese-manufactured KN95 masks also fulfill the purpose.
(5) FFP masks - These masks are manufactured in Europe and are available in three varieties - FFP1, FFP2 as well as FFP3. The third variety are highly efficient for filtering out as high as ninety nine percent particulate matter.
The air masks are definitely effective, especially when it comes to N95 or FFP2/FFP3 masks. There are numerous researches to prove the effectiveness of N95 masks in filtering out particulate matter 2.5 by over 90 percent. Masks help to minimize the inhalation of potential irritants such as pollen, dust, industrial gasses etc. and thus reducing the risk of asthma, bronchitis etc.
Air masks are definitely not a myth and provide protection from particulate matter suspended in the air if used correctly and if the right kind of mask is used. You just need to use the appropriate type and well-fitted mask and follow proper usage guidelines. Prefer a certified mask with a high filtration rate which fits you appropriately and choose the ones with replaceable filters for long-term effectiveness.

New Delhi: Even as the national capital continues to battle poor air quality, experts on Wednesday said that the toxic pollutants are raising dry eyes, irritations, and allergies in the eyes of children and adults.
On Wednesday morning, Delhi’s air quality remained in the “severe” category with the average Air Quality Index (AQI) at 427 at 10 am, making it the most polluted city in India, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data.
“Pollution poses a serious threat to our eyes, particularly to the conjunctiva and the cornea, which is the first point of contact with harmful particles in the air. The fine particulate matter, allergens, and toxins in polluted environments can irritate the ocular surface and make it highly susceptible to infections,” Dr. Rohit Saxena, professor of ophthalmology, R P Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, AIIMS New Delhi, told IANS.
“This is especially of concern in children and adults already experiencing dry eyes or allergic reactions, as these conditions worsen with exposure to poor air quality,” he added.
On Wednesday morning, about 12 out of 38 air quality monitoring stations in Delhi reported an AQI of 450 or above. Environment Minister Gopal Rai has directed the Delhi government to grant half of the staff to work from home.
A recent study by researchers from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus showed that people living in areas with increased exposure to PM10 can be twice more at risk of suffering eye infections.
The study showed that clinical visits by patients suffering ocular surface eye conditions -- that affect the eye surface, including the cornea, conjunctiva, and eyelids -- more than doubled when ambient particulate matter from air pollution was in the atmosphere.
Air pollution can significantly affect eye health causing discomfort and irritation. The polluted air carries suspended particles, dust, and pollutants which can irritate the eyes.
Saxena noted that frequent eye rubbing of the irritated eyes can weaken the cornea over time and lead to conditions like keratoconus -- an eye condition that causes the cornea to thin and bulge into a cone shape, which can lead to vision loss.
Common symptoms include itching, watering, burning, redness, and a general feeling of soreness.
“In severe cases, air pollution may lead to pain or blurred vision, requiring immediate medical attention,” Dr. Smriti Goel, Consultant - Eye Surgery, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Patparganj, told IANS.
The doctor suggested avoiding over-the-counter medications other than lubricating eye drops unless prescribed by a doctor.
""Use lubricating drops to maintain moisture, and apply cold compresses to relieve irritation. Wear protective glasses or sunglasses to shield your eyes from dust and pollutants. For allergy-prone individuals, anti-allergic eye drops and timely treatment are essential. These measures can help safeguard your eyes from pollution-related issues,” Goel said.
Pollution isn’t just a respiratory issue -- it has harmful effects on the entire body including on the ocular health, the experts said recommending people to limit outdoor exposure during peak periods of pollution.

The air pollution situation in Pakistan has reached a catastrophic level, surpassing even the worst environmental conditions seen in the region in recent years. With the Air Quality Index (AQI) crossing the 2000 mark in major cities like Lahore and Multan, the provincial government has been forced to take extreme measures, including imposing a lockdown and declaring a health emergency.
In response to the hazardous levels of pollution, the Punjab government has declared a complete lockdown in Lahore and Multan for the upcoming Friday, Saturday, and Sunday if the situation does not improve by Wednesday.
The lockdown will remain in effect as long as the AQI remains dangerously high, and authorities have pledged to monitor the air quality closely during this period. If the situation does not improve, the lockdown could be extended, further affecting daily life and economic activities in the region.
These drastic steps aim to limit outdoor activities and reduce exposure to the toxic air, which has reached unprecedented levels. The immediate concern is the health impact on the population, with many residents already suffering from severe respiratory issues.
The pollution crisis has already taken a severe toll on public health, with over 600,000 people in Punjab suffering from respiratory-related illnesses in the past week alone. Among these, approximately 65,000 individuals required hospitalization, creating a massive strain on medical facilities.
Hospitals in cities like Lahore are overwhelmed with patients presenting symptoms such as dry cough, pneumonia, chest infections, and difficulty breathing. Medical staff are under immense pressure, and as a result, leaves for paramedics have been canceled to ensure adequate staffing during the crisis. To manage the influx of patients, outpatient departments (OPDs) in many hospitals have extended their operating hours until 8 PM.
Mayo Hospital in Lahore has reported more than 4,000 cases of pollution-related illnesses, while Jinnah Hospital has treated 3,500 patients in just a short period. Other hospitals in the region are also seeing similar surges in patient numbers. The situation has led to fears that the healthcare system could soon become overwhelmed if pollution levels continue to rise.
To combat the worsening pollution levels, the Punjab government has imposed a series of measures aimed at reducing emissions. These include the temporary closure of marriage halls, restaurants, and other non-essential businesses that contribute to air pollution. In addition, several shops have been sealed for violating pollution control regulations.
Educational institutions, including schools and colleges, have been closed indefinitely to prevent children and young adults from being exposed to harmful air. Meanwhile, private offices have been ordered to operate at only 50% capacity, a move intended to limit the number of people traveling and working in affected areas.
In a bid to reduce the pollution levels, authorities are exploring innovative measures such as creating artificial rain in certain cities. The goal of these efforts is to cleanse the air and bring down the AQI to safer levels. However, experts warn that such solutions are only temporary and that long-term strategies are essential to address the root causes of the pollution crisis.

Air quality in Delhi and its neighboring areas has reached a crisis point, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) soaring to hazardous levels of 500 (severe plus) on November 19. This marks the seventh consecutive day of extreme pollution in the National Capital Region (NCR), exacerbated by a dense blanket of smog that has enveloped the region.
According to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), several locations across Delhi, including Anand Vihar, Ashok Vihar, Bawana, Jahangirpuri, and Major Dhyan Chand Stadium, recorded AQI readings of 500 at 5 a.m. on Tuesday, November 19.
Other areas like Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Dwarka Sector-8, Munka, North Campus, RK Puram, and Wazirpur also reported similarly dire air quality readings.
The high AQI indicates that the air is dangerously polluted, posing severe health risks to residents. This alarming situation has led authorities to declare a ""medical emergency"" and issue widespread health advisories urging people to avoid outdoor activities, particularly vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing respiratory conditions.
In response to the hazardous air quality, Delhi University (DU) and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) have decided to shift their classes to online mode. DU announced that physical classes will remain suspended until November 25, while JNU will continue online classes until November 22.
Both universities also clarified that scheduled exams and interviews would proceed as planned, despite the shift to virtual learning.
As air pollution continues to deteriorate, the Delhi government has also taken steps to ensure the safety of students. The Directorate of Education has instructed both government and private schools to switch to online classes for all grades, including Classes 10 and 12.
Delhi Chief Minister Atishi confirmed that in-person classes for these senior grades will be suspended starting November 20.
The Supreme Court of India has stepped in to address the escalating pollution crisis. On November 18, the Court directed all states in the Delhi-NCR region to form teams that would strictly enforce the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP-4). This plan includes a series of emergency measures designed to curb air pollution, such as shutting down construction activities, restricting the use of diesel generators, and closing industries that contribute to pollution.
The Court also reprimanded the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) for delays in implementing the necessary measures. It underscored the constitutional duty of all states to ensure that citizens have the right to live in a pollution-free environment.
The primary factors contributing to Delhi's severe air quality are the prevailing weather conditions and widespread stubble burning in nearby states. These combined elements have led to the trapping of pollutants over the city, intensifying the smog and reducing visibility.
In light of the ongoing health crisis, the Union Health Secretary issued an updated advisory urging all states and union territories to enhance their healthcare systems to address air pollution-related illnesses. The advisory also recommended raising awareness among vulnerable groups, including those in high-risk occupations such as construction workers and those with pre-existing respiratory conditions.
The government has been urged to establish monitoring systems and expand networks of sentinel hospitals to manage pollution-related health impacts effectively.
As the situation continues to worsen, more schools and educational institutions are expected to adapt to the online format to protect students from the harmful effects of the toxic air.
The Delhi government is closely monitoring the situation, with a focus on public health and safety.

Delhi, a city celebrated for its rich culture and history, faces a pressing environmental challenge: air pollution. Unfortunately, the city has earned the global reputation of being one of the most polluted, with factors like heavy traffic, vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust contributing significantly to the deteriorating air quality.
Ranked as the world’s most polluted capital in 2019, Delhi’s air quality regularly breaches safe limits, with particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) levels dangerously high. These microscopic pollutants penetrate deep into lung passageways and enter the bloodstream, leading to severe health consequences.
Dr. Lalit Mohan Parashar, Senior Consultant – ENT at MASSH Super Speciality Hospitals, highlights the diverse health risks posed by polluted air. He states: “Short-term exposure can cause respiratory infections, headaches, and dizziness. Prolonged exposure, however, leads to chronic conditions like respiratory diseases, cardiovascular disorders, and even lung cancer. Children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing conditions are particularly vulnerable.”
The statistics paint a grim picture. Reports from 2019 attribute over 1.67 million deaths in India to air pollution, with Delhi’s residents facing some of the worst per capita death rates from particulate pollution. Beyond the human toll, the economic burden is staggering, with health-related expenses running into billions annually.
Dr. Parashar further emphasizes the growing health crisis: “Over the years, I have witnessed a notable increase in cases of air pollution-related ailments. Conditions that were once seasonal, like respiratory infections, now persist year-round. This public health crisis demands stricter air quality control measures and greater public awareness to mitigate the risks.”
To safeguard yourself and your loved ones from the adverse effects of air pollution, consider these practical measures:
Stay Hydrated: Drinking plenty of water helps clear nasal and respiratory passages by thinning mucus and trapping pollutants.
Use Nasal Protection: Applying edible oil inside your nostrils can trap pollutants before they enter your lungs.
Increase Indoor Humidity: Adding a tabletop fountain or other water sources can boost indoor humidity, causing airborne pollutants to settle and improving indoor air quality.
The health impacts of air pollution are undeniable, and Delhi’s situation is a stark reminder of the urgent need for collective action. By implementing preventive measures, raising awareness, and advocating for stricter pollution control policies, we can work towards cleaner air and better health for all.

As Delhi's air quality has sharply worsened, reaching the hazardous 'severe plus' category, the government has introduced stricter anti-pollution measures. At 6 am on Monday, the air quality index registered 481, a level classified as 'severe plus'.
On Sunday evening, the Air Quality Index (AQI) soared to 457, triggering the activation of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP-IV) starting November 18 at 8 am. The decision was made in response to the escalating pollution levels, which have now reached critical levels, endangering public health.
To address the worsening air quality, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has rolled out a series of emergency measures to curb pollution and protect citizens. These restrictions will apply across the entire National Capital Region (NCR) and are expected to remain in place until air quality improves. The main actions include:
1. Truck Entry Ban: Non-essential trucks will be prohibited from entering Delhi, except for those transporting essential goods, or vehicles powered by LNG, CNG, electric, or BS-VI diesel engines.
2. Restrictions on Light Commercial Vehicles (LCVs): Light commercial vehicles (LCVs) registered outside Delhi, unless they are electric, CNG, or BS-VI compliant, will also be restricted from entering the city. However, exemptions will be made for vehicles providing essential services.
3. School Closures and Online Classes: Primary schools in Delhi will remain closed, while classes for students in grades 6-9 and 11 will transition to online learning. In-person classes will continue for students in grades 10 and 12.
4. Office Work Restrictions: Government, municipal, and private offices will operate at 50% capacity, with the remaining employees working from home. The central government is expected to issue further guidelines for its workforce in response to the situation.
Delhi has been experiencing dangerously high pollution levels for the past week. On Monday morning, the AQI in several parts of the city crossed the 500 mark, a level deemed ""severe.""
The city has been grappling with heavy smog, a toxic mix of smoke and fog that traps pollutants, including emissions from stubble burning, in the atmosphere. These dangerous conditions are compounded by unfavorable weather, with low winds and cooling temperatures exacerbating the pollution problem.
The Indian Meteorological Department has forecast that smog conditions, along with low wind speeds and high humidity, will persist until Saturday, contributing further to the pollution crisis.

Air Pollution In Delhi: The Delhi Transport Department has impounded 2,234 overage vehicles between October 1 and November 15 as part of an ongoing drive. The initiative, launched last month, aims to address the deteriorating air quality in the national capital.
According to official data, the seized vehicles include 260 diesel four-wheelers that are over 10 years old, alongside 1,156 petrol two-wheelers and 818 petrol three and four-wheelers, all older than 15 years.
The campaign, which is set to continue until December, is part of a broader effort to enforce environmental regulations and reduce vehicular emissions.
In tandem with the crackdown, the Transport Department has rolled out an online portal to facilitate the scrapping, retrieval, or sale of seized vehicles.
The platform is designed to streamline the process, providing owners with a clear Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for managing overage vehicles.
The Transport Department has also issued directives to Registered Vehicle Scrapping Facilities (RVSFs) to adhere strictly to the 2024 guidelines for handling end-of-life vehicles, as mandated by a recent Delhi High Court order.
Non-compliance of the order could result in exclusion from the program, officials warned.
This drive follows a 2018 Supreme Court ruling that banned the operation of diesel vehicles older than 10 years and petrol vehicles older than 15 years in Delhi.
Additionally, a 2014 National Green Tribunal (NGT) order prohibits parking of vehicles over 15 years old in public places.
More than 55 lakh overage vehicles have been de-registered in Delhi, according to an October 10 public notice by the Transport Department.
To ensure effective enforcement, traffic police have also been directed to deploy four teams per municipal zone in coordination with the department's enforcement wing.

Gurugram Air Quality Index: Rising air pollution levels have forced authorities in Gurugram to shut physical classes for students up to Class 12 in all schools - Government and private across the district, effective from November 19. In a notification issued by the District Collector's office, it was announced that online classes will replace physical sessions for students up to Class 5 until further notice.
""As per directives from Director Secondary Education Haryana, and after assessing the Air Quality Index (AQI) situation, all physical classes up to 12th standard in District Gurugram will remain suspended from 19th Nov 2024 to 23rd Nov 2024 (or until further orders). AQI has worsened to a Severe category in some areas,"" said the DC, Gurugram in a late night notification. In the earlier notification issued in the evening, it was said that the classes till 5 will go online.
The decision follows an alarming deterioration in the Air Quality Index (AQI) in the district over the past 24 hours. The AQI, which was already in the ""Very Poor"" category, has now worsened to the ""Severe"" category in several areas, according to the notice. Officials assessed the situation on November 17 and 18 before taking this step to safeguard the health of young children.
Citing directives from the Director General of Elementary Education, Haryana, the District Collector’s office stated, “In the interest of the health and safety of the children, it has been decided that all classes up to 5th standard will remain discontinued from 19.11.2024 till further orders in all areas (urban as well as rural) of District Gurugram.”
The statement emphasized the need for compliance, noting that online classes will be conducted in lieu of physical ones in all government and private schools across the district.
This precautionary move comes as air pollution levels in Gurugram and neighboring areas continue to pose serious health risks, particularly for vulnerable groups such as young children. Authorities have urged schools and parents to adhere strictly to the order to ensure children’s safety during this hazardous period. Further updates on the resumption of physical classes will depend on improvements in the air quality.
Earlier last week, Delhi has shifted classes up to class 5 to online due to rising air pollution.

Pakistan Air Pollution: Over 75,000 people in Pakistan's Punjab province, sought medical assistance on Saturday due to respiratory issues caused by toxic smog and air pollution, according to sources from healthcare monitoring authorities, as reported by the Express Tribune. Additionally, hospitals treated 3,359 asthma patients, 286 individuals with heart conditions, 60 stroke victims, and 627 cases of conjunctivitis.
Lahore recorded the highest number of air pollution-related cases, with 5,353 individuals seeking hospital treatment for respiratory issues, including 359 asthma patients, 171 with heart disease, 20 stroke victims, and 303 cases of conjunctivitis. Sources indicated that major hospitals in Lahore and other densely populated cities were overwhelmed, as thousands of patients sought treatment for illnesses caused by pollution.
In response, the Pakistan Punjab government declared a health emergency in the Lahore and Multan divisions, implementing several restrictions over the past two weeks to manage the smog crisis.
In both divisions, schools, colleges, and universities were closed, and all outdoor public activities were prohibited. Parks were also closed, and market hours were limited to reduce citizens' exposure to the smog.
Artificial rain was triggered, bringing some relief to certain areas, but the smog's intensity has continued unabated. The ongoing air pollution crisis has stretched the capacity of hospitals in major cities to their limits. In response, authorities have cancelled the holidays of medical staff and made extra arrangements to accommodate the influx of patients in government hospitals. However, the monitoring team from the Department of Primary and Secondary Healthcare has reported a concerning situation.
A senior official from the department's monitoring wing stated that the number of patients in hospitals had reached its peak, and it may become increasingly difficult to manage the growing influx of patients in outpatient and emergency departments in the coming days.
The official revealed that over 1.91 million people with respiratory diseases had been admitted to government hospitals over the past 30 days, with 133,429 cases reported in Lahore alone. Additionally, 119,462 asthma patients had been registered, including 5,577 in Lahore.
During the smog-affected month, Lahore accounted for 5,455 of the 13,862 heart disease patients treated in hospitals across the province and 491 of the 5,141 stroke patients. A total of 11,913 people in the province were affected by conjunctivitis, with 1,945 cases reported in Lahore.
The official stated that the situation had deteriorated over the past week, with 449,045 people seeking treatment for respiratory issues, 30,146 for asthma, 2,225 for heart diseases, 1,400 for strokes, and 3,889 for conjunctivitis across hospitals in the province.
A spokesperson for the health department, Sayed Hamad Raza, acknowledged that the situation was critical but assured that authorities had made extensive arrangements in hospitals. He stated that all emergency leaves for medical staff had been cancelled and that treatment services were being provided around the clock. Health ministry officials are also closely monitoring the situation, he added.

Trending Photos
New Delhi: Patients with heart disease, specifically those with heart failure, are especially vulnerable to the impacts of air pollution and poor air quality and can take steps to protect themselves, a new study has said.
Results from the Intermountain Health study, presented at the American Heart Association’s 2024 Scientific Sessions international conference in Chicago, found that two inflammatory markers — CCL27 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 27) and IL-18 (interleukin 18) — were elevated in heart failure patients who were exposed to poor air quality, but did not change in those without heart disease.
While previous research has shown that people with some chronic health conditions, like heart failure, coronary disease, asthma, and COPD, struggle during spikes in air pollution, the new study demonstrates that cardiac inflammation levels specifically rise in people with heart disease during periods of poor air quality.
“These biomarkers rose in response to air pollution in people who already had heart disease, but not in patients who were heart disease free, showing that heart failure patients are not as able to adapt to changes in the environment,” said Benjamin Horne, principal investigator of the study and professor of research at Intermountain Health.
Researchers specifically looked at blood tests for 115 different proteins that are signs of increased inflammation in the body.
These spikes were caused by either wildfire smoke in the summer, or during a winter inversion, where air pollution is trapped when warm air holds pollution closer to the ground.
Researchers found that two inflammatory markers — CCL27 and IL-18 — were elevated in heart failure patients, but did not change in those without heart disease, indicating that such air pollution events put more strain on the bodies of patients who already have heart problems.
These findings “give us some information about mechanisms in people with heart failure who are having inflammation and suggest they’re not as capable in responding to acute inflammation as people who are healthy,” said Dr Horne.
Heart failure patients need to take extra precautions during times when air pollution is high.

The Delhi government has implemented a ban on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel four-wheelers in the national capital . This measure comes as part of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP-III), which aims to combat severe air pollution levels.
Under the new order, any vehicle found violating the ban will face severe penalties. The government has specified that offenders will be prosecuted under Section 194(1) of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, with a fine of Rs 20,000. The banned vehicles include:
Diesel-operated Medium Goods Vehicles (MGVs) of BS-III standards or below registered in Delhi, except those carrying essential commodities or providing essential services.
Diesel-operated Light Commercial Vehicles (LCVs), particularly goods carriers, registered outside Delhi, unless transporting essential goods or services.
Additionally, Inter-State buses from NCR states, which are not EVs, CNG-powered, or BS-VI diesel, will be prohibited from entering Delhi, except those with All India Tourist Permits.
The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP-III) has been invoked by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to address the worsening air quality in Delhi-NCR. With the Air Quality Index (AQI) in the ""severe"" category, this stage of the action plan has been activated from 8 am on Friday, marking a significant escalation in the city's efforts to tackle air pollution.
To mitigate the effects of the severe air quality, the Delhi government will implement several measures under the GRAP-III guidelines:
Enhanced public transport services: Increased frequency of public buses to encourage the use of public transport.
Differential pricing: Pricing strategies to encourage travel during off-peak hours, reducing congestion and emissions during peak traffic times.
The Graded Response Action Plan classifies air quality levels into four stages based on AQI readings:
This year, Stage III measures have been invoked later than in 2023, when the plan was activated on November 2nd. The current implementation of GRAP-III supplements the ongoing Stage-I and Stage-II measures already in place to tackle air pollution in Delhi-NCR.

The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has imposed GRAP 3 measures as the national capital recorded the worst pollution levels in the country, with the air quality remaining in the ""severe"" category for two consecutive days.
On Friday the city's air quality was in the severe category with an AQI of 411 at 9 am. Delhi Environment Minister, addressing a press conference said that the Air Quality Index (AQI), which has consistently crossed hazardous levels, led to the enforcement of GRAP-3.
""We are working to make GRAP-3 more effective in Delhi,"" the minister said, adding that a meeting was held with officials from MCD, PWD, transport, DTC, metro, and education departments to review and implement urgent measures.
As part of the action plan, the Delhi government has banned the entry of non-CNG inter-state buses into the city. Only electric buses and those running on CNG will be allowed entry. In addition, BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel four-wheelers have been prohibited, Rai said.
To ensure enforcement, the transport department has deployed 84 teams, with an additional 280 transport police personnel, to monitor violations. A fine of Rs. 20,000 will be imposed for any breaches of the new rules.
The minister highlighted that to reduce vehicular pollution, 106 new cluster bus services have been introduced. Among these, 40 buses have been specifically launched for government employees residing in various parts of the city to discourage the use of private vehicles.
The routes will include key areas such as Nehru Place, Rohini, Dwarka, Janakpuri, Shahdara and others.
The GRAP for Delhi-NCR is divided into four stages of air quality - Stage 1 for “poor” Air Quality Index (AQI) ranging between 201 and 300, Stage 2 for “very poor” AQI of 301-400, Stage 3 for “severe” AQI of 401-450 and Stage 4 for “severe plus” AQI more than 450.
Curbs under Stage III include a ban on non-essential construction and demolition and closure of stone crushers and mining activities in the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR).
Under the Stage-IV restrictions of GRAP, all inter-state buses from NCR states - except electric vehicles, CNG vehicles and BS-VI diesel buses-will be prohibited from entering Delhi, alongside a stringent ban on construction and demolition activities, suspension of mining-related activities, consideration of shifting to online classes for students up to Class V and daily water sprinkling on major roads.
To further reduce traffic emissions, metro services will increase by 60 additional trips, and road cleaning efforts will be enhanced with 65 dust suppression machines deployed by the MCD.
Moreover, 200 mobile anti-smog guns will be used in three shifts for water sprinkling on roads, with designated drivers in each shift to ensure continuous operations.
Meanwhile, the Delhi government is also taking steps to regulate construction activities, banning private construction and demolition works, and restricting non-essential work. Public and government services, however, will continue as usual, Rai said.
Addressing the media, the minister urged residents to use a cycle for short distances, rely on public transport, carpool, and work from home whenever possible to help reduce pollution levels.
If the air quality deteriorates further, the minister mentioned that emergency measures, including artificial rain, would be considered. ""We will seek support from the Centre if required,"" he added.

Air quality across Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) continued to remain in the ""severe"" category on November 15, 2024, as a thick blanket of smog engulfed the city.
With the Air Quality Index (AQI) reaching alarming levels, the government implemented strict measures under the third stage of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP-III). This includes a series of restrictions aimed at curbing pollution and protecting public health.
As of early Thursday morning, the AQI at key locations like Anand Vihar, Bawana, Dwarka Sector 8, and Jahangirpuri surpassed 400, entering the ""severe"" category. The AQI readings at these areas ranged from 441 to 458, indicating hazardous air quality.
The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) reported a citywide AQI of 424 at 4pm, marking a slight increase from the previous day's 418.
Out of Delhi’s 39 monitoring stations, 27 recorded severe air quality levels, including high-density areas like ITO, IGI Airport, and North Campus. The hazardous air quality has raised significant health concerns, particularly for children, the elderly, and people with pre-existing respiratory conditions.
To tackle the escalating pollution levels, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) invoked the third stage of the GRAP, which brings in several stringent measures:
Given the hazardous air quality, the Delhi government has announced the suspension of physical classes for primary school students (Classes 1 to 5). Online classes, however, will continue, ensuring that education is not disrupted despite the pollution crisis. This measure aims to minimize children's exposure to the harmful air, which can aggravate respiratory issues.
After the implementation of GRAP- III, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has announced to increase its services. An additional 20 trips will be introduced on weekdays, starting Friday. This is in addition to the 40 extra trips that were already added with the implementation of GRAP-II.
Under GRAP-III, certain exemptions have been made to keep essential services running:
Permitted Vehicles: Electric vehicles (EVs), CNG-powered vehicles, and BS-VI diesel buses are allowed to operate within Delhi and NCR.
Low-Impact Construction Activities: Construction activities that are less polluting, such as those adhering to strict dust-control measures, can continue in the NCR region.
The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) is a set of emergency measures designed to reduce air pollution levels during severe events. It has four stages, each corresponding to different AQI ranges:
Delhi’s air quality has been fluctuating between the “very poor” and “severe” categories since the end of October, with the first severe air quality levels recorded on November 13.

Delhi Air Pollution: With Delhi's Air Quality Index entering the 'severe' level, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has ordered to implementation of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)-III in the national capital region. With this, the construction will be halted across the region and inter-state buses/trucks won't be allowed to ply. The tighter rule is aimed to curb pollution emnating from different sources as the AQI reached 418 on Thursday.
With the GRAP-III in effect, all non-essential construction and demolition work are banned. Under the enforcement of GRAP-3, petrol vehicles that comply with the older BS-III emission standards and diesel vehicles meeting BS-IV standards are prohibited from operating on roads in Delhi and specific areas of the National Capital Region (NCR), including Gurugram, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, and Gautam Budh Nagar.
As per CAQM, there will be a strict ban on construction and demolition activities - road construction, including paving of sidewalks, restriction on boring and drilling work, laying of sewer line, drainage work etc, loading and unloading of construction material, and movement of vehicles on unpaved roads.
Under the third stage of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), all inter-state buses from NCR states -- except electric vehicles, CNG vehicles and BS-VI diesel buses -- will be prohibited from entering Delhi, alongside a stringent ban on construction and demolition activities, suspension of mining-related activities, consideration of shifting to online classes for students up to Class 5 and daily water sprinkling on major roads.
Under the third stage of the GRAP, there would be restrictions on the plying of BS-lll petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles in Delhi and the districts of Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar.
The GRAP has 4 stages — stage I when AQI ranges between 201 and 300, stage II when AQI is 301-400, stage III when AQI is 401-450 and stage IV when AQI is between 450 and 500.

Delhi woke up with is facing with its worst air quality of the season, as thick fog and rising pollution levels have caused the Air Quality Index (AQI) to surge into the ""severe"" category for the second consecutive day.
The national capital recorded an AQI of 432 at 6 a.m. on Thursday, a sharp spike from the previous day's reading of 418. With fog engulfing the city and much of North India, air quality has deteriorated rapidly, affecting millions of residents.
As of Thursday morning, the AQI in several areas of Delhi breached the 400 mark, which falls under the ""severe"" category. Anand Vihar recorded a dangerously high AQI of 473 at 5 a.m., while other areas like Aya Nagar, Ashok Vihar, and Wazirpur also reported AQI levels above 400.
The city's overall air quality averaged at 432, further confirming the alarming pollution levels.
On Wednesday, Delhi’s air quality hit the ""severe"" category for the first time this season, with the AQI climbing to 418 by 4 p.m. The pollution worsened by evening, reaching a high of 454 by 9 p.m., indicating an escalating health risk for residents.
The AQI scale, ranging from 0 to 450+, categorizes air quality as follows: 0-50 (Good), 51-100 (Satisfactory), 101-200 (Moderate), 201-300 (Poor), 301-400 (Very Poor), 401-450 (Severe), and anything above 450 as ""Severe Plus.""
The India Meteorological Department (IMD) confirmed that ""dense to very dense fog"" is likely to persist during the night and early morning hours across parts of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, and surrounding regions until Saturday.
In addition to the fog, Delhi's temperatures have also dropped significantly. The city recorded its lowest daytime temperature of the season on Wednesday, with Safdarjung witnessing a sharp decline from 32.8°C on Tuesday to 27.8°C on Wednesday.
The cooler weather has compounded the issue, making the air more stagnant and allowing pollutants to accumulate.
Despite the severe pollution levels, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has decided not to implement Stage 3 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) at this time. Stage 3 would typically include measures such as halting in-person classes for primary schools and imposing a ban on construction activities.
However, the CAQM has reassured the public that the situation will likely improve as the pollutant concentration is expected to decline from Thursday onwards, with the AQI forecasted to return to the ""very poor"" category.
Prolonged exposure to ""severe"" air quality levels poses significant health risks, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing respiratory or heart conditions. Respiratory problems, eye irritation, and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases are common consequences of poor air quality.
Experts urge residents to take precautions, including wearing N95 masks, limiting outdoor activities, and ensuring proper ventilation indoors.
The air quality in Delhi is expected to improve slightly in the coming days as weather conditions change. However, the persistent fog and cold temperatures in the region indicate that pollution levels may remain high through the weekend.
The IMD has also forecasted foggy conditions across several northern states, including Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh, until at least Saturday.

MCD Parking Charges In Delhi: The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) is planning to double its parking charges in a bid to discourage the use of private vehicles and curb air pollution caused by vehicular emissions, officials said on Monday. A proposal for this will be tabled at the upcoming MCD House meeting scheduled for November 14, the same day as the elections for Delhi's next mayor and deputy mayor.
The idea of raising parking charges under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)-II has been on the agenda for a while but has been repeatedly referred back to the House for reconsideration. Initially, the MCD had proposed increasing the charges fourfold, but following deliberations, a revised proposal to raise the fees by just two times has now been prepared, officials said. However, the official did not specify the reason for reducing the proposed hike.
""In the upcoming House meeting, we will seek approval for increasing the parking charges. After extensive deliberations, the MCD has revised its proposal to double parking charges instead of the initially planned fourfold increase. Once this proposal is passed, it will be implemented as soon as possible,"" the official said.
While other agencies, including the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), have already implemented the fee increase under CAQM's directions, the MCD has yet to enforce the hike.
In October, NDMC doubled its parking charges complying with directives to curb air pollution.
The MCD is waiting for the proposal's clearance from the House before it can be implemented. If disruptions occur during the House session, as is often the case during elections, the proposal may face further delays.
As part of the Stage II of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to tackle pollution, additional restrictions are imposed, such as bans on the use of coal and firewood in restaurants and the use of diesel generators, except for essential services.
Parking charges are also enhanced to encourage people to switch to public transport, which would help reduce overall pollution levels.

Trending Photos
Poor air quality may not only spike respiratory, cardiac, and mental health issues but can also lead to weight gain and obesity -- a precursor to several diseases, said doctors on Monday, even as the national capital saw worse pollution levels.
On Monday, Delhi's air quality further plummeted with the Air Quality Index (AQI) surpassing 400 in multiple parts of the national capital, placing it in the 'severe' category.
Areas including Anand Vihar (433), Ashok Vihar (410), Rohini (411), and Vivek Vihar (426) registered AQI levels above 400, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).
Other regions like Dwarka, Patparganj, Jahangirpuri, and Punjabi Bagh also recorded 'severe' AQI levels.
Different studies have proven that an increase in PM10 &amp; PM2.5 leads to an increase in Body Mass Index (BMI). Long-term exposure to toxic air -- consisting of particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide -- can drive systemic inflammation and metabolic disturbances. These factors are crucial in weight gain and obesity.
Besides causing damage to the lungs, liver, and kidneys, PM2.5 can also influence metabolism rates.
The health experts noted that poor air quality can force people to stay indoors and decrease physical activity levels -- leading to obesity.
“People of Delhi are getting scared to go out of their homes. The outdoor activity of younger children who are in the growing phase of their lives, are severely restricted due to which they engage themselves in indoor activities such as playing games on the phone or watching television. Lack of physical exercise in this group of patients and overeating leads to the problem of obesity,” Dr (prof) Bobby Bhalotra, Vice Chairman, Department of Respiratory Medicine at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi, told IANS.
He added that patients suffering from hypertension and diabetes are also at risk of weight gain.
“These patients have to do the walking as part of their treatment and they are used to walking every day to burn extra calories and keep their muscles active. Due to air pollution, they are locked inside their home and hence are gaining weight. Obesity in both of these groups of patients is mentally as physically very harmful,” Bhalotra added.
According to a recent meta-analysis published in the journal BMC Public Health, air pollution can impair metabolic function by influencing inflammation in fat tissue, increasing oxidative stress, and altering individual dietary habits, with a ""negative effect on glucose metabolism"" -- leading to weight gain.
“Different studies have proven that an increase in PM 10 and PM 2.5 leads to an increase in body mass index (BMI). This effect is more pronounced in adolescence where rise in obesity is related to increase in air pollution,” Dr. Vivek Bindal, Director &amp; Head– Max Institute of Minimal Access, Bariatric &amp; Robotic Surgery, Max Super Speciality Hospital, told IANS.

An AQI is considered as ""poor"" between '200 and 300', ""very poor"" at '301 and 400', ""severe"" at '401-450"" and 450 and above, is ""severe plus."".
Aditya, a resident of Delhi, said, "" It is very difficult to breathe.... this is not a time we can go out and do exercise; pollution is affecting our eyes.""
A thin layer of smog engulfed parts of the national capital on Sunday. Meanwhile, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said that around 200 mobile anti-smog guns will be deployed across the national capital to combat dust pollution.
Speaking to ANI on Saturday, Gopal Rai said that the Delhi government is continuously working on the ground to combat the rising pollution levels.
He further said that to address dust pollution, the Delhi government will deploy 200 mobile anti-smog guns throughout the city, which will operate in three shifts of eight hours each, spraying water in every assembly constituency to help control dust levels.
""Whether it is dust pollution, vehicle pollution or biomass burning, our teams are continuously working on targeting these three on the ground,"" he said. As per System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) data, the AQI was recorded at 296 at 7 am on Saturday in Delhi.

On Sunday, the Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 352, in the 'very poor' category, according to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). This is worse than the average AQI recorded at 255 on Saturday, categorized as 'poor'.
Moreover, AQI in the Anand Vihar area crossed the 400 mark, being recorded as 405 at 7 AM, categorized as 'severe', worse than the AQI of 367 recorded on Saturday. AQI at the Akshardham Temple deteriorated 261, whereas IGI airport recorded an AQI of 324, both categorized as 'very poor'. A layer of thick smog enveloped certain parts of the national capital.
Residents of the national capital felt that the rising pollution in the city felt suffocating and urged the city government to intervene to reduce pollution. Himanshu, a visitor to the capital, said that the increasing pollution feels 'suffocating.' ""It feels suffocating due to pollution... The government should look into what can be done to reduce pollution,"" he told news agency ANI.
Moreover, a cyclist in the city told ANI that they are facing a lot of problems with breathing. ""We are from Delhi, and we (the cyclist group) cycle daily here, but with this situation of air pollution since the last few days, we are facing a lot of problems. We can't breathe properly; we get tired faster due to the pollution. We take precautions like wearing a bandana, but nothing is working because the pollution is increasing a lot,"" he said.
He further said that the measures taken by the government don't seem effective enough, and the government should encourage the people to use public transport more. ""The government did some work, like stopping construction and implementing odd-even, but it doesn't seem like it is working as this is increasing day by day. There should be constructive measures to encourage people to use public transport and carpool,"" he added.
In response to the increasing pollution and worsening air quality, the Delhi government has taken few steps to curb pollution. As the festival of lights nears, the Atishi Singh-led government in Delhi has banned fireworks till January 1. Moreover, toxic foam on the Yamuna river in the Kalindi Kunj area persisted.
Earlier the pollution in the river was at the center of hot political debate between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), with BJP leader Shazia Ilmi criticizing the Delhi government for its handling of the city's worsening pollution crisis, highlighting the alarming presence of toxic foam in the River Yamuna and the resulting breathing difficulties for residents.
""BJP leader Virendraa Sachdeva has fallen ill. Two days ago, he took a dip in the Yamuna River. Today he is admitted to the hospital...This is an issue connected to the health of the public in Delhi. Where have the Rs 3000 crore meant for the public of Delhi and Yamuna River? The public of Delhi is not able to breathe... Toxic foam is floating on the Yamuna River,"" Ilmi told ANI.
Notably, Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai slammed the saffron  party and accused it of contributing to the increasing pollution in the national capital. ""The BJP is the party that creates pollution and seems to believe that only drama can solve it. I think all governments and parties need to work together. I wish them good health, but stopping these theatrics alone won't reduce pollution. This reflects the BJP leaders' level of understanding. When I was preparing the winter action plan, I had written to the BJP President, but no response or suggestions have come so far,"" he told ANI.

Delhi AQI: With Delhi's air quality entering the 'severe' zone with the Air Quality Index of 363, the Supreme Court on Wednesday rapped the came down heavily on the Punjab, Haryana and the Union government for not taking the air pollution and stubble burning issue seriously. The apex court expressed its displeasure over 'cherry picking of FIR registration' and imposition of nominal fines.
A thick layer of smog enveloped the national capital Wednesday morning as its air quality remained in the 'very poor' category on Wednesday. During a hearing on the issue, the top court took strong exception to Punjab and Haryana governments not taking any action against people for stubble burning.
The apex court remarked that if these governments are really interested in implementing the law, there would have been at least one prosecution. The Supreme Court told the Chief Secretary of Punjab that around 1,080 FIRs were registered against the violators, but the government collected nominal fines from only 473 people. ""You are sparing 600 or more people. We will tell you very frankly that you are giving a signal to violators that nothing will be done against them. This has been for the past three years,"" said the SC.
Haryana’s Chief Secretary informed the Supreme Court that 400 crop-burning incidents have been reported and the state has registered 32 FIRs.  The top court said that Haryana is taking compensation from few and registering FIR against very few.
The Supreme Court grilled the governments over non-compliance and their failure to enforce anti-pollution measures. A bench of Justice Abhay S Oka, Justice A Amanullah, and Justice AG Masih, termed the efforts by the state governments to stamp out farm fires a 'mere eyewash'. The Supreme Court also pulled up the Centre for making the environment protection law 'toothless”, and said the provision under the CAQM Act which deals with penalty for stubble burning was not being implemented.
On October 16, the top court had pulled up the Punjab and Haryana governments over the non-prosecution of violators found guilty of stubble burning while summoning the state chief secretaries to appear before it on October 23 for an explanation.

On Tuesday, the air quality in Delhi and the surrounding National Capital Region (NCR) deteriorated significantly. The Air Quality Index (AQI) crossing 310, placing it in the 'very poor' category. A thick layer of smog covered the city and nearby areas such as Noida, prompting authorities to enforce Stage II of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).
In response to the worsening pollution levels, the second stage of GRAP was activated across Delhi. Under these measures, the use of coal and firewood, including in tandoors at restaurants, hotels, and open eateries, has been banned. Additionally, diesel generator sets, except for essential and emergency services, have been prohibited. These restrictions aim to curb further degradation of air quality during this critical period.
GRAP is a set of emergency measures that are activated depending on the severity of air pollution in Delhi and NCR. It categorizes pollution levels into four stages:
- Stage I: 'Poor' (AQI 201-300)
- Stage II: 'Very Poor' (AQI 301-400)
- Stage III: 'Severe' (AQI 401-450)
- Stage IV: 'Severe Plus' (AQI above 450)
According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), out of the 36 air quality monitoring stations in Delhi, 26 reported AQI levels in the 'very poor' category. Areas with critically high pollution levels included Anand Vihar, Dwarka, Rohini, Bawana, Jahangirpuri, Patparganj, and others.
Delhi's pollution levels are attributed to multiple sources. Transportation emissions account for approximately 10.9% of the overall pollution, according to data from the Centre's Decision Support System for Air Quality Management. Additionally, dust pollution and stubble burning from neighboring states exacerbate the situation.
Satellite data recorded 65 active farm fires in Punjab, two in Haryana, and 25 in Uttar Pradesh on Monday, adding to the pollutants in Delhi's air. The burning of crop residue has long been a contentious issue, contributing significantly to Delhi's poor air quality, particularly during the winter season.
As winter sets in, Delhi faces heightened pollution levels due to meteorological conditions such as low wind speeds, cooler temperatures, and higher moisture levels, which allow pollution particles to linger in the air. These conditions, combined with emissions, create an unhealthy environment for residents.
Delhi has already begun experiencing cooler mornings and evenings, with the maximum temperature recorded at 34.7 degrees Celsius on Monday, slightly above normal.
The weather department has predicted a maximum temperature of 35 degrees Celsius and a minimum of 20 degrees Celsius for Tuesday.

As the air quality index of the capital city is deteriorating, the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is blaming the buses entering Delhi from Uttar Pradesh responsible, particularly in the Anand Vihar area. This comes as the AQI in the Anand Vihar area hit 454 at 8:30 AM today. The party further accused the BJP-ruled states of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana of discharging untreated effluents into the Yamuna River, contributing to the frothing pollution, according to a report by news agency ANI.
“The major cause of pollution in Anand Vihar is the buses coming from UP. Haryana and UP release their untreated effluents into the Yamuna,” said Delhi chief minister Atishi, promising to hold discussions with the UP government to address these concerns.
In a press conference, Atishi posed the question, “Why can't Haryana and UP governments introduce CNG and electric buses in their fleet?” Adding a layer in the ongoing blame game, “If we see the buses in Anand Vihar, which records the maximum AQI, Delhi's buses are all run on CNG or electricity. But if we see the buses coming from UP and Haryana, they run on Diesel. An important reason for the pollution seen in the Anand Vihar area is the thousands of diesel-run buses coming from UP,” the Delhi CM further added.
Air quality in the National Capital Region has steadily worsened over the past week, with dense smog blanketing the skies. Delhi Chief Minister Atishi, along with Environment Minister Gopal Rai, inspected the Anand Vihar area, where air quality has plunged into the 'severe' category.
The Delhi government has outlined a series of measures to tackle rising air pollution, according to Chief Minister Atishi. “Anti-pollution measures are being strictly enforced in Delhi. We have formed 99 teams for dust control across the city and begun deploying over 325 smog guns. Both the PWD and MCD have mobilized all available resources to combat pollution,” Atishi said. She also noted that Anand Vihar, located at the Delhi-UP border, remains a pollution hotspot with the highest AQI levels.
Environment Minister Gopal Rai attributed a significant rise in Delhi’s pollution to buses arriving from Uttar Pradesh, stating that they are ""doubling the pollution"" load in the capital. Rai urged the Yogi Adityanath-led government to initiate water sprinkling at the Kaushambi bus depot to help curb the issue.
As of 8:30 AM, the Air Quality Index (AQI) at ITO in Delhi stood at 232, categorized as 'Poor.' Jahangirpuri recorded a higher AQI of 350, placing it in the 'Very Poor' category. In Nehru Park and surrounding areas, the AQI was recorded at 254, also falling under the 'Poor' category.

Trending Photos
The festive season brings joy, celebrations, and a sense of togetherness. However, it also brings with it increased levels of air pollution, especially in urban areas. From firecrackers during Diwali to the burning of crop residue in many parts of India, the air quality can drastically decline, posing serious health risks. Protecting yourself and your loved ones from pollution during the festivities is essential to ensure that celebrations remain healthy and safe.
Here are some practical steps you can take to safeguard yourself from pollution this festive season:
Wearing masks has become a common practice due to the pandemic, but they also play a significant role in protecting you from harmful air pollutants. N95 and N99 masks are designed to filter out the majority of particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10), making them an excellent barrier against pollution. Make sure to wear one when stepping outside, especially in areas where the air quality is poor.
It’s best to limit your time outdoors, especially during peak pollution hours. Early mornings and late evenings often experience higher pollution levels due to lower temperatures and stagnant air. If you must go out, try to schedule activities during the middle of the day when pollution levels are lower.
Indoor air can also be affected by outdoor pollution. Investing in a good air purifier for your home can significantly improve indoor air quality. Look for purifiers with HEPA filters that can trap small particles, ensuring that the air inside your home is clean and safe to breathe.
While ventilation is important, keeping windows and doors shut during periods of high pollution is essential to prevent pollutants from entering your home. Consider sealing any gaps in windows or doors where pollution might seep in, especially during Diwali when firecrackers are being used.
Drinking plenty of water helps your body flush out toxins and keeps your respiratory system functioning properly. Staying hydrated can also reduce the impact of pollutants on your body by keeping your throat and nasal passages moist, allowing them to better filter out harmful particles.
A strong immune system can help your body fight off the harmful effects of pollution. Incorporate immunity-boosting foods like ginger, turmeric, honey, and citrus fruits into your diet. These foods are rich in antioxidants, which can help protect your body from oxidative stress caused by pollutants.
One of the major contributors to air pollution during the festive season is the use of firecrackers. Opt for environmentally-friendly ways to celebrate, like using LED lights or organizing community events that do not involve crackers. Many cities are also encouraging green Diwali celebrations, so consider supporting these initiatives to reduce overall pollution.
Certain indoor plants are known for their air-purifying properties, such as aloe vera, spider plants, and peace lilies. These plants can absorb toxins and increase oxygen levels in your home, making your living space healthier and more breathable.
Steam inhalation can help clear your airways, making it easier for your lungs to filter out pollutants. If you’ve been exposed to high levels of pollution, taking steam with a few drops of eucalyptus or peppermint oil can be a soothing and beneficial practice to cleanse your respiratory system.
Stay informed about the air quality in your area using apps or websites that track pollution levels, such as AirVisual or SAFAR. These tools can help you plan your day and avoid outdoor activities during times when pollution is particularly high.
While staying active is important, outdoor exercises like jogging or cycling should be avoided during periods of high pollution. Opt for indoor workouts such as yoga, pilates, or home cardio exercises to stay fit without exposing yourself to harmful pollutants.
This festive season, while we embrace the joy and traditions that come with celebrations, it’s equally important to be mindful of the impact of pollution on our health. By taking proactive measures, such as wearing masks, using air purifiers, and staying informed about air quality, you can protect yourself and your loved ones from the harmful effects of pollution and enjoy a healthier, safer festive season.

Trending Photos
New Delhi: Evidence is increasing to show the link between air pollution and the risk of Parkinson’s disease, health experts said on Tuesday.
More than 10 million people worldwide are living with Parkinson's disease. India alone shares almost 10 per cent of the global burden of Parkinson's disease.
A recent study, published in the JAMA Network Open, showed higher levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure were associated with increased risk of Parkinson's.
“Yes, there is growing evidence that air pollution can increase the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease,” Dr Anshu Rohtagi Senior Neurologist, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, told IANS.
“Recent studies have shown that exposure to pollutants like PM2.5 and NO2 can also worsen Parkinson’s symptoms,” Rohtagi added.
PM2.5 is a harmful substance that can penetrate the lungs and affect our health. It can come from natural sources like volcanoes and deserts or human activities like industry, cars, agriculture, domestic burning, and climate change-related fires.
Besides Parkinson's, PM2.5 has been linked to various health issues, including asthma, reduced lung health, increased risk of cancer and heart disease, and diabetes, and Alzheimer's.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends an annual average concentration of 5 micrograms per cubic meter air (5 ug/m³) as very good air quality. However, 99 per cent of the world's population lives with concentrations above this value.
Rohtagi said higher levels of air pollution, particularly in metropolitan areas, are associated with a greater risk of developing Parkinson’s disease.
For those already diagnosed with Parkinson’s, exposure to air pollution can lead to more severe disease progression and symptoms.
“Pollutants like PM2.5 can cross the blood-brain barrier, causing inflammation and oxidative stress, which are believed to contribute to the development and progression of Parkinson’s disease,” the expert noted.

Trending Photos
Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution is linked to a higher risk of infertility in men, according to a Danish study.
The study led by researchers at the Nord Universitet in Denmark throws light on a significant worldwide health issue, infertility which affects one in every seven couples.
Studies on sperm quality and the success of fertility treatments have found negative correlations with particulate air pollution; however, results on fecundability, or the probability of becoming pregnant, have been inconsistent, and no research has looked into the impact of transportation noise on infertility in men and women.
The study, published in the journal BMJ, found that prolonged exposure to PM2.5 is associated with a higher risk of infertility in men.
The team included 526,056 men aged 30-45 years, with fewer than two children, residing in Denmark between 2000 and 2017.
Exposure to higher than average levels of PM2.5 over five years was associated with a 24 per cent increased risk of infertility in men aged 30-45 years.
Since this is an observational study, it is impossible to determine a cause, said the researchers. They also recognised that their data on lifestyle characteristics and exposure to air pollution at work and during leisure activities may be incomplete and couples who are not attempting to conceive may not have been included.
The study stresses the need to enact air pollution measures to raise birth rates worldwide. Governments can improve reproductive health outcomes by improving the environment and addressing air quality issues.
By encouraging the fight for better air, a very basic human right for everyone, this proactive strategy may play a significant role in creating a population that is both healthier and more sustainable in the contemporary world.

Indoor air pollution is a bigger health risk than outdoor air pollution in India, and sometimes cities are cleaner than nearby villages where household pollution is higher, according to the country's two top policy experts.
Addressing the India Clean Air Summit (ICAS) 2024, Principal Advisor, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Soumya Swaminathan said, ""Studies done in Delhi have shown that women's average exposure to high levels of black carbon (women who are mostly at home) is as much as auto-rickshaw passengers going around outdoor exposed to the ambient air pollution in Delhi, resulting in high systolic blood pressure."" ""Cities contribute less than 20 percent to the overall state emissions, wherever they have been assessed, but household emissions predominate, ranging between 20 percent and 40 percent. Across the country, we are seeing is that sometimes cities are cleaner than the surrounding villages where household air pollution predominates,"" she said at the summit organised by the think-tank Center for Study of Science, Technology, and Policy.
This builds a strong case for expanding the scope of India's National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), which currently focuses on non-attainment cities.
Air pollution is a major threat to public health and contributes to a significant amount of morbidity as well as mortality.
Apart from PM2.5 and PM10, short-lived climate pollutants such as black carbon, methane, ozone, and hydrocarbons have the potential to harm the environment and warm the atmosphere even more than CO2. Black carbon can cause chronic respiratory illnesses, lung cancer, emphysema, pneumonia, asthma, heart disease, and low birth weight.
""In terms of reducing our life expectancy, globally, PM2.5 is contributing to about 2.3 years of life lost. Just below that is tobacco. There's so much attention on tobacco and global frameworks for control, but not the same level of attention has been paid to PM2.5 and certainly not the same level of commitments,"" Swaminathan said.
The impact of air pollution is not limited to public health but has a significant economic cost as well. Recently, the World Bank published a study highlighting that air pollution has resulted in a loss of around USD 8.1 trillion in 2019, which is 6.1 per cent of the global gross domestic product (GDP).
""We are always talking about air pollution as a problem but studies also show a strong economic case for action on clean air. There are significant positive consequences to investing in cleaning up the air in terms of the return on investments. We know air pollution is not just bad for our health, but it's also bad for agriculture, because it reduces the sunlight that's reaching the crops and it's bad for our economy or any country's economy as it deters people from coming and living or visiting those places,"" Swaminathan added.
Kalpana Balakrishnan, Director, WHO Collaborating Center for Occupational and Environmental Health, said that the main barrier to shifting to clean cooking fuels that can help reduce household air pollution levels is finance.
""If we give free LPG to women for two years, they are unlikely to shift back to biomass cooking even if you remove the subsidies,"" she said.
Through Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) launched in May 2016, more than 100 million households in India received LPG cylinders by the end of March 2023.
Government data shows over 50 per cent of the households that received new LPG cylinders under PMUY did not choose to refill it even once.
Around a third of the world's population — 2.4 billion people globally (including 500 million people in India) — still lack access to clean cooking solutions.
Although the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MOPNG) claims that the country's household LPG ""coverage"" stands at 99.8 percent, the National Family Health Survey conducted in 2019–21 (NFHS-5) shows that 41 per cent of the population still cooks on biomass.

The Lancet Planetary Health has released the report.

India currently has clean air standards far beyond the World Health Organization's recommended level of 15 micrograms per cubic meter of air. The paper argues that to safeguard its inhabitants from the hazards of contaminated air, India needs to significantly lower its clean air standards to at least comply with WHO recommendations.
The study discovered that even air pollution levels below present air quality regulations in India raise the nation's daily death rates.
Over 33,000 deaths annually in ten cities in the country—Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Shimla, and Varanasi—can be linked to air pollution levels beyond WHO recommendations.
""A significant number of deaths were observed even in cities not considered to have high air pollution, such as Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata, and Chennai,"" according to the report. ""India's national air quality standards should be made more stringent, and efforts to control air pollution redoubled,"" reports also added this.
During the study period, Delhi had the greatest rate of air pollution-related mortality (11.5 percent, or 12,000 deaths annually). ""The deaths were attributable to short-term PM.5 exposure higher than the WHO guideline value,"" the research demonstrated.
During the period, Varanasi recorded the second greatest number of deaths (10.2%, or about 830 deaths annually), which were linked to short-term PM2.5 exposure that exceeded the WHO guideline value. The study found that there was a 1.17% increase in daily fatalities for every 10 micrograms per cubic meter of air rise in short-term PM exposure.
Shimla had the lowest recorded air pollution levels. Air pollution was still a concern in the hill city, though, since 3.7% of all fatalities, or 59 per year, were linked to brief exposure to PM2.5 levels over WHO guidelines. ""The results from Shimla add credence to global evidence that there is no safe level of air pollution exposure,"" the research stated.

Reducing air pollution levels in India can be the key to curb the rising burden of diabetes in the country, health experts said on Thursday.
With a tenth of all Indians having diabetes, the country is already known as the diabetes capital of the world. Data shows India is home to 101 million diabetics and 136 million pre-diabetic people. The prevalence of chronic disease is expected to soar further, especially among young adults.
Earlier known to affect the lungs, research now confirms that air pollution can be a significant contributor to the onset of diabetes in India.
The latest Lancet study showed that 20 per cent of global Type 2 diabetes cases are related to chronic exposure to particulate matter (PM) with a diameter of 2·5 micrometres or less (PM2·5).
About 13.4 per cent was derived from ambient PM2.5 and 6.5 per cent from household air pollution.
Dr Ambrish Mithal, Chairman, Endocrinology and Diabetes, Max HealthCare, told IANS that there is now data to suggest that PM 2.5, which is 30 times thinner than the human hair increases the risk of type two diabetes.
""Even one month of exposure can increase the risk of insulin resistance and developing diabetes. And prolonged exposure will increase the risk of diabetes by up to 20 per cent,"" he said.
The air pollution levels in India are among the highest in the world. In 2023, the country was ranked the third-most polluted country globally, after Bangladesh and Pakistan, as per the 2023: World Air Quality Report.
So, while the WHO recommends five micrograms per cubic metre of PM 2.5 is acceptable, in India, the average is 50, and in some cities, it goes up even higher, the doctor said.
""The effect of air pollution on the lungs has been well documented. Recent evidence shows that air pollution can also act as an endocrine disruptor leading to type 2 diabetes,"" Dr V. Mohan, Chairman, Madras Diabetes Research Foundation and Dr Mohan’s Diabetes Specialities Centre told IANS.
Citing a recent study from India which followed 12,064 adults residing in Delhi and Chennai for 7 years, he said: ""A 10 milligrams per cubic metre of air, increase in monthly average exposure to PM2.5 was associated with 0.04 milligrams per deciliter increase in fasting sugar and a 0.021 unit increase in HbA1c.""
The HbA1c test is used to evaluate a person's level of glucose control.
""An increase in average annual PM2.5 exposure by 10 milligrams per cubic metre of air, was associated with a 22 per cent increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes. This shows the importance of avoiding air pollution to improve the health of people in general and in the prevention of type 2 diabetes in particular,"" the noted diabetologist said.
Experts noted that curbing air pollution levels is one of the most important modifiable risk factors for preventing new onset of diabetes cases.
How is air pollution linked to diabetes?
PM 2.5 is a tiny particle that enters the bloodstream and attaches to the cells to produce insulin resistance.
""It can possibly attack the pancreas and cause inflammation there and possibly reduce insulin secretion,” Dr Mithal said.
""While the exact mechanism is not clearly worked out, it seems to be both at the level of insulin resistance and insulin secretion. But, there is no doubt that there is a link between air pollution and diabetes and it is one of the significant contributing factors in the increase of diabetes in India,"" he added.
The doctor noted that poor air quality is also emerging as a major factor behind the rising cardiovascular problems in the country.
""Amid the growing link between diabetes, heart risk, and air pollution we need cleaner energy and rules on pollution,"" Dr Anoop Misra, Chairman & Director, of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Fortis C-Doc Hospital, told IANS.
""More green spaces in cities can also help. Masks and air purifiers might help a bit, but not everyone can afford purifiers. Public education is key. We need everyone government, businesses, and communities to work together,"" he said.

New Delhi: Delhi air pollution has once again increased in the city. The air quality (Delhi AQI Today) reached 456 today. As a result, GRAP-3 restrictions (GRAP-3 Restrictions) have been imposed in Delhi once again. Under this, vehicles with BS-3 petrol and BS-4 diesel will not be allowed entry in Delhi. Along with this, construction, building demolition and other construction works will be stopped. It is to be noted that the CAQM sub-committee (CAQM Sub-Committee) has implemented GRAP-3 in Delhi amid worsening AQI. After the implementation of GRAP-3, an 8-point action plan will be worked on. Delhi air quality deteriorates
It is to be noted that the air quality (Delhi Air Quality) in Delhi is very poor today. The overall AQI in Delhi is above 450. The air quality in all areas of Delhi is in the severe category. Today, the AQI was 478 in Anand Vihar, 465 at Delhi Airport and 455 at ITO. Meanwhile, talking about NCR, the AQI was 444 in Noida, 392 in Greater Noida and 396 in Gurugram.
The implementation of GRAP-3 in Delhi means that now stone crushing, mining and related activities, construction and building demolition activities will be banned in the entire NCR area. Action will be taken against those who violate the rules. These rules will have to be strictly followed.
These vehicles will be barred from entry Along with Delhi, NCR i.e. Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Noida will also have a ban on the movement of BS-3 III petrol and BS-4 diesel 4 wheeler vehicles. In addition, online classes for children up to class 5 in schools in NCR can be started. The government will have to decide on this.

As Delhi grapples with a biting cold wave and escalating winter pollution, it becomes imperative for residents to safeguard their health from the dual challenges posed by the weather and air quality. Recent research from Arizona's Barrow Neurological Institute underscores a 56 percent higher risk of developing Parkinson's disease due to air pollution. Similarly, an Oxford study reveals that children and adolescents exposed to air pollution during critical stages of mental development face a heightened risk of future mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, dementia, and schizophrenia.
These concerns are particularly poignant as seven of the top 10 most polluted cities globally are located in India. While seeking refuge indoors during colder temperatures seems a logical response, it's essential to question whether our indoor spaces are truly immune to the perils of pollution.
Sealing windows and doors may create a false sense of protection, as it inadvertently traps pollutants inside. Vehicle exhaust fumes, pollen, mold spores, and pollutants generated within our homes converge, creating a complex concoction of dirty air.
Shockingly, indoor pollution can be up to 10 times worse than outdoor air pollution, warns Senior Design Engineer at Dyson, Sam Railton: ""By spending more time indoors during the colder months, our day-to-day activities increase the level of indoor pollutants – from cooking and cleaning to using personal care products like deodorant.""
In response to these challenges, Sam Railton, Senior Design Engineer at Dyson suggests practical steps to maintain a healthy indoor Air Quality Index (AQI) and ensure a conducive living environment:
1. Reduce Pollution Sources: Minimize the use of aerosol sprays and candles within your home. Adjust routines to include fewer polluting activities. When cooking with frying oil, ensure proper ventilation or use a purifier. Opening a window, if outdoor air pollution is low, is an option, but caution is advised about introducing outdoor pollutants.
2. Combat Dust: Dust mites thrive in warm, dark places like sofas and beds. Everyday activities, such as using central heating, can disturb microscopic dust, contributing to indoor pollution. Regularly vacuum soft furnishings to reduce allergens.
3. Utilize Air Purifiers: Investing in an air purifier equipped with HEPA filters becomes crucial. These filters ensure comprehensive filtration, trapping various pollutants and maintaining a healthy indoor environment.
When selecting an air purifier, consider features such as advanced filtration technologies, the ability to remove fine and ultra-fine particles, and the unit's area of coverage and air circulation.
Proactively implementing measures to minimize exposure to common household pollutants can significantly enhance indoor air quality, offering a shield against the health risks associated with elevated air pollution levels during the winter months.

Polluted air may trigger more asthma attacks in urban children and teenagers, according to a study published online in The Lancet Planetary Health journal. Even moderate levels of ozone and fine airborne particulates -- two ingredients of smog -- appear to increase kids' risk of asthma attacks, the findings revealed.
""The strong association this study demonstrates between specific air pollutants among children in impoverished urban communities and non-viral asthma attacks further augments the evidence that reducing air pollution would improve human health,"" said Dr. Hugh Auchincloss, acting director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).
The study also tied the ozone and fine airborne particulates to distinct changes in children's airways that could trigger an asthma attack, said Dr. Matthew Altman, Associate Professor in the department of medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine, in Seattle.

It's one of the first times elevated levels of distinctive air pollutants in specific urban locations have been tied to the risk of asthma attacks.
During an asthma attack, inflammation causes the lining of airways to swell as muscles around the airways contract and mucus floods the passages -- all substantially narrowing the space through which air passes in and out of the lungs.
Children in low-income urban areas are at particularly high risk for asthma attacks, the researchers said. The study included 208 children aged six to 17 with attack-prone asthma living in low-income neighbourhoods in one of nine different US cities.
The researchers later validated their findings in a second group of 189 people aged six to 20 living in low-income areas of four US cities. The team tracked daily air quality and compared it to reports of asthma attacks in the urban children. They also checked to make sure that the children weren't suffering from respiratory viruses that can promote asthma.
The researchers found that asthma attacks were caused by pollution rather than viruses in nearly 30 per cent of the children, two to three times the proportion seen in children who don't live in urban areas. The attacks were specifically associated with locally elevated levels of fine particulates and ozone in outdoor air, the team said.
By analysing nasal cell samples obtained from the children, the investigators further found that elevated levels of those pollutants affected the expression of genes that play a role in airway inflammation. These results could lead to treatments that would counteract the harmful effects of air pollution on human airways, the researchers reported.
The findings also indicate that people with asthma might benefit from toting around personal air quality monitors, which could warn them of conditions that contribute to asthma attacks.

The Air Quality Index (AQI) across Delhi improved slightly from 'very poor' on Tuesday to 'poor' on Wednesday morning, as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). As per the data from CPCB, the AQI at Anand Vihar stood at 291, in the IGI airport area at 279, in the ITO at 252, and in the Narela area at 283 on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department has predicted no rainfall in the National Capital till December 11. There will be clear skies with shallow to moderate fog in the morning across the city.
Earlier on Tuesday, the Air Quality Index (AQI) across Delhi dipped into 'very poor' category in several areas. Delhi has been experiencing air quality in the range of 'severe' to 'very poor' over the last few weeks. Light rains lashed several parts of Delhi-NCR on Sunday, bringing respite to citizens breathing high levels of air pollution. Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai last week said that Grap-3 has been lifted in the national capital but the government is trying to ensure that Grap-1 and 2 are strictly implemented.
""Due to the change in weather during the last two days, there has been a decline in pollution. Commission for Air Quality Management has lifted the restrictions of Grap-3. The ban on BS-3 petrol and BS-4 diesel vehicles and the ban on construction demolition have been lifted. GRAP 3 is imposed when AQI is 400, but it continued despite low AQI because fluctuations were visible in AQI after Diwali. If the wind speed slows down, AQI may increase again, hence GRAP-1 and GRAP-2 should be strictly implemented. For this, directions are being given to all the departments again,"" Gopal Rai said.
The air quality index from 0 to 100 is considered 'good', 100 to 200 'moderate', 200 to 300 'poor', 300 to 400 'very poor' and from 400 to 500 or above 'severe'.

Trending Photos
Air pollution is a major threat to human health, children are especially vulnerable to its adverse effects. Children's developing bodies, along with their immature immune systems, make them more vulnerable to the harmful effects of polluted air.
Children breathe more rapidly than adults, taking in more air relative to their body weight. This increased breathing rate exposes them to higher concentrations of air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone. Their respiratory systems, which are still in the early stages of development, are more susceptible to damage from these pollutants, leading to a greater risk of respiratory problems.
Air pollutants, particularly pm 2.5 can enter the house and cause a threat to a child. Additionally, there are a number of sources of pollutants indoors such as house dust, fungus from seepage, aerosols, indoor plants, pets, and tobacco smoke exposure.

Prioritizing pollution control measures and immediately consulting a health expert for health-related symptoms can go a long way to protect children from the adverse effects of environmental pollutants.
Dr Ram Gopal Holla, Senior Consultant Neonatology and Pediatrics, Rosewalk by Rainbow Children's Hospital explains how air pollution can affect children.
Dr Holla shares, exposure to air pollution has been linked to a number of respiratory problems in children, including asthma, bronchitis, and other chronic respiratory conditions. Small particles present in polluted air can penetrate deep into the lungs, causing inflammation and irritation. Prolonged exposure can cause long-term damage, affecting respiratory function in childhood and adulthood.
Asthma, Naso bronchial allergy, and reactive airway disease, a common childhood respiratory problem, have been strongly linked to air pollution. Studies have shown that exposure to high levels of pollutants can trigger asthma attacks in children, worsen symptoms, and increase the number of hospitalizations. Additionally, air pollution has been identified as a potential factor in the development of asthma in children who were previously unaffected. At the individual level, the use of masks (to be worn appropriately), air purifiers, and the reduction of indoor pollutants need to be implemented.
Dr Holla explains, tackling the risks associated with air pollution requires a multi-pronged approach. Implementing and enforcing strict air quality standards, reducing emissions from industrial sources and transportation, and promoting sustainable urban planning are important steps to reduce the effects of air pollution on children's health. Additionally, increasing awareness among parents, caregivers, and teachers about the importance of reducing children's exposure to polluted air may contribute to preventive measures.

Investing in high-quality sunglasses that block both UVA and UVB rays can act as a shield against harmful airborne particles. Wraparound designs provide additional coverage, preventing pollutants from reaching your eyes. Opt for sunglasses with large frames to minimize the entry of pollutants from the sides.
Frequent exposure to pollutants can lead to dry and irritated eyes. Using artificial tears or lubricating eye drops can help alleviate discomfort and maintain moisture. Ensure the drops are preservative-free to avoid additional irritation.
Practicing good eye hygiene is essential in polluted environments. Wash your hands regularly to prevent transferring contaminants to your eyes, and refrain from rubbing your eyes to minimize the risk of introducing pollutants directly.
Proper hydration is crucial for maintaining the moisture levels in your eyes. Drinking an adequate amount of water helps counteract the drying effects of pollution and promotes overall eye health.
Being mindful of pollution levels and adjusting your outdoor activities accordingly can significantly reduce exposure. Check air quality indices regularly and try to schedule outdoor activities during times when pollution levels are lower. Consider indoor exercise options during periods of elevated pollution.
Improving indoor air quality can contribute to overall eye health. Use air purifiers with HEPA filters to reduce indoor pollutants, and keep windows closed during high pollution periods to minimize the influx of external contaminants.
Nutrition plays a vital role in maintaining eye health. Include foods rich in vitamins A, C, and E, as well as omega-3 fatty acids, in your diet. These nutrients contribute to the health of your eyes and may offer protection against the harmful effects of pollution.
If your work involves prolonged screen time, follow the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and focus on something 20 feet away. This reduces eye strain and allows your eyes to rest, minimizing the impact of environmental factors.

As nations grapple with soaring pollution levels, understanding the intricate connection between air quality and maternal-child health becomes imperative. Dr Neelam Suri , Senior Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, Laparoscopic and Robotic surgeon, Academic advisor, Deptt of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, New Delhi shares how can air pollution have an adverse effect on maternal and child’s health.
Dr Suri shares the following problems are the negative consequences of air pollution:
· Low birth weight
· Preterm birth
· Stillbirth
· Congenital malformations
· Respiratory infections
· Asthma
· Cardiovascular disease
· Developmental delays
Dr Suri shares, pregnant women are more sensitive to the dangers of air pollution. PM2.5 particles can easily pass the placenta and enter the fetal bloodstream, where they can harm developing organs and systems. Air pollution has been associated to a variety of negative pregnancy outcomes, including:
1. Low Birth Weight: Babies with low birth weights are at a higher risk of a variety of health issues, including newborn death, developmental delays, and chronic disorders later in life.
2. Preterm birth: Babies born before 37 weeks of gestation are also at a higher risk of health complications. Premature birth is the primary cause of death and disability in children under the age of five.
3. Stillbirth: Stillbirth occurs when a baby dies in the womb after 20 weeks of gestation. Even after controlling for other factors such as maternal smoking and socioeconomic status, air pollution exposure has been associated with an increased risk of stillbirth.
Dr Suri shares, children are also more vulnerable to the detrimental impacts of air pollution. Their lungs are still developing, and youngsters are more prone to breathe quickly, which might expose them to more contaminants. Air pollution has been linked to a variety of negative child health outcomes, including:
1. Respiratory infections: Exposure to air pollution can irritate the airways, making children more vulnerable to respiratory diseases such as pneumonia and bronchitis.
2. Asthma: Exposure to air pollution is a key risk factor for asthma, a chronic respiratory disease that can make breathing difficult.

In the bustling metro city of Delhi, where the air quality index often reaches alarming levels, a new concern has emerged — the potential link between air pollution and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Health experts have shed light on how the toxic air we breathe may be contributing to the diabetes epidemic in urban areas.
In an interiview with Zee News English, Dr Mahesh D M, Consultant, Endocrinology Aster CMI Hospital shares how pollution increase the risk of diabetes with the current air quality getting worse every day.
Recent studies have unveiled a disconcerting connection between air pollution and diabetes, particularly in densely populated regions like Delhi. The culprit? A combination of high traffic emissions and industrial pollutants that saturate the air. These environmental stressors not only jeopardize respiratory health but may also be silently elevating the risk of diabetes among the population.
Researchers highlight various mechanisms through which air pollution can heighten the risk of diabetes. Dr Mahesh says, ""One key factor is inflammation, a process that can wreak havoc on cells and tissues. The inflammation triggered by pollutants can disrupt the body's ability to metabolize glucose. In simpler terms, it damages the cells and tissues responsible for insulin production, rendering them resistant to insulin. The consequence? Elevated blood sugar levels, a red flag for diabetes.""
Moreover, Dr Mahesh adds, ""pollution-induced oxidative stress emerges as another culprit. The pancreas, crucial for insulin production, becomes a target of damage under the assault of oxidative stress caused by pollutants. As the very organ responsible for regulating blood sugar levels, any impairment to the pancreas can tip the balance towards diabetes.""
To combat this growing health concern, experts emphasize the importance of adopting preventive measures.
Dr Mahesh, an Endocrinology specialist recommends, ""Individuals are advised to stay indoors during peak pollution hours and consider using air purifiers at home to create a safer indoor environment. Furthermore, adhering to diabetic guidelines provided by medical practitioners is crucial. A healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet high in protein and low in carbohydrates, regular exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, and abstaining from alcohol and tobacco, can significantly mitigate the risks associated with pollution-induced diabetes.""
As Delhi grapples with its air quality crisis, it becomes imperative for individuals to prioritize their health by understanding the intricate link between air pollution and diabetes. By taking proactive steps, both at an individual and societal level, we can strive to breathe cleaner air and safeguard our well-being in the face of this silent health threat.

In addition, Wazir said that the constant exposure to pollution heightens stress and anxiety levels, impacting the mental well-being of pregnant women. ""As their immune systems become compromised, the risk of infections during pregnancy rises,"" she said.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives showed that certain pollutants can negatively alter anogenital distance, a measure of prenatal exposure to hormones. Researchers at the Rutgers University in the US suggest that air pollution can interfere with normal hormone activity during critical periods of prenatal and early infant development.
This disruption may have long-term consequences for reproductive health, they said. Air pollution is a major public health concern. The hazardous air quality poses significant respiratory risks, increasing the likelihood of complications such as asthma and bronchitis. However, pregnant and expecting women are particularly vulnerable to its harmful effects. It is because, ""pregnant and expecting women are breathing for two.
The placenta, which is the organ that connects the mother to the foetus, is permeable to air pollutants. And the foetus, which is developing rapidly, is more vulnerable to the effects of environmental toxins. Exposure to air pollution during pregnancy has been linked to several adverse health outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight, congenital heart defects, asthma, and autism spectrum disorder,"" Dr Priyanka Suhag, Consultant, Dept of Obstetrics & Gynaecology at the CK Birla Hospital (R), Delhi, told IANS.
Nisha Bhatnagar, MBBS. MD (ObGyn), Medical Director, Infinite Fertility added that daily exposure to high pollution levels is increasingly recognised as a significant contributor to declining fertility.
Besides women's reproductive health, prolonged exposure to bad air also affects men's sperm quality.
""Deteriorating air quality not only affects respiratory health but also leads to reduced sexual drive among couples trying to conceive. Exposure to air with estrogenic and antiandrogenic substances can impair testosterone and sperm production,"" the doctor told IANS.
Air pollution can be a silent adversary to fertility, affecting both men and women. The toxins in polluted air may disrupt hormonal balance and impair reproductive health. The experts suggested limiting outdoor activities during times when air pollution levels are highest, focus on a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management to support overall health, and engage in activities like prenatal yoga and meditation for stress relief.
""To protect your fertility, consider wearing masks in highly polluted areas. Prioritising a healthy lifestyle, with a balanced diet and regular exercise, can also mitigate the impact of air pollution. Awareness, precaution, and timely interventions are our allies in the fight for reproductive well-being,"" Dr. Lavi Sodhi, Consultant, MBBS, DNB (Obstetrics and Gynaecology), Birla Fertility & IVF, Lajpat Nagar, told IANS.

Air pollution levels across major cities in India have been deteriorating as the winter season approaches and post-Diwali, the condition worsened especially in Delhi-NCR. Air pollution can lead to many health complications, affecting lung health as well as leading to cardiovascular diseases. But according to experts, prolonged exposure can also make one more vulnerable to diseases like cancer. Dr Akshat Malik, Head & Neck Cancer Surgeon, Max Super Specialty Hospital, Saket, New Delhi, shares, ""Air pollution can contribute to the development of cancer through various mechanisms, primarily by introducing or promoting harmful substances in the body.""
Dr Akshat Malik shares some of the ways in which air pollution can lead to cancer:
Introduction of Carcinogens: Air pollution contains a mixture of chemicals, some of which are known carcinogens (substances that can cause cancer). For example, particulate matter (especially fine particles like PM2.5) can carry carcinogenic compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), into the respiratory system when inhaled. These chemicals can then come into contact with lung tissue, potentially leading to DNA damage and mutations that may initiate cancerous growth.
Inflammation and Oxidative Stress: Exposure to certain components of air pollution, like PM2.5 and ozone (O3), can lead to inflammation and oxidative stress in the body. Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress can disrupt cellular processes and DNA repair mechanisms, increasing the risk of genetic mutations and the development of cancer.
DNA Damage: Some chemicals in air pollution can directly interact with DNA, causing damage. This damage may interfere with the normal functioning of cells and increase the likelihood of uncontrolled cell growth, a hallmark of cancer.
Promotion Of Tumour Growth: Air pollution can create an environment in the body that is conducive to the growth of tumours. For example, certain pollutants can stimulate the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) around tumours, providing them with a steady supply of nutrients and oxygen.
Weakening Of Immune Response: Prolonged exposure to air pollution can weaken the immune system's ability to recognise and eliminate abnormal or cancerous cells. This can allow cancer cells to evade immune surveillance and proliferate.
Alteration Of Hormonal Balance: Some components of air pollution, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals, can interfere with the body's hormonal balance. This disruption can potentially lead to hormonal changes that promote the development of hormone-related cancers, like breast and prostate cancer.
Synergistic Effects With Other Risk Factors: Air pollution can interact with other risk factors, such as tobacco smoke or occupational exposures, to increase the overall risk of cancer. For example, exposure to both tobacco smoke and air pollution can have a synergistic effect on lung cancer risk.
""It's important to note that the specific mechanisms and the extent of their contribution to cancer risk may vary depending on the type and concentration of pollutants, individual susceptibility, and other environmental and genetic factors. Reducing exposure to air pollution and adopting measures to improve air quality are crucial steps in reducing the associated cancer risks. Additionally, early detection and intervention remain important in managing and treating cancer,"" says Dr Akshat Malik.

As Diwali celebrations peak, card parties bring a spread of tempting sweets and snacks. The festive allure, coupled with chilly weather, enhances the Diwali charm. However, overindulgence and smog can jeopardize well-being, disrupting the festive spirit. It's crucial to exercise caution in daily activities to safeguard your health and sustain the festive joy.
Post-Diwali, Delhi-NCR's air quality has significantly deteriorated, falling into the 'poor' category on Monday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). This comes after the city was engulfed in a thick layer of smog following the bursting of firecrackers on Diwali night.
1. Long-term Health Impacts
Prolonged exposure to air pollution is a leading cause of respiratory issues, contributing to cardiovascular problems, pulmonary insufficiency, and chronic asthma. Pregnant women are particularly advised to avoid strenuous activity in areas with poor air quality, as prolonged exposure may lead to complications.
2. Environmental Effect
Air pollution is contributing to a global rise in temperatures, resulting in the melting of icebergs and glaciers in polar regions. The annual melting of 1.2 trillion tonnes of ice translates into water that directly flows into our oceans. The long-term consequences of air pollution from fireworks have the potential to exacerbate the climate crisis, posing a serious threat to our environment.
Dr Farah Ingale, Senior consultant Physician & Diabetologist, Fortis Hiranandani Hospital, Vashi, Navi Mumbai shares
Diwali's festive cheer brings with it a tempting array of snacks and sweets, making overeating almost irresistible. Indulging in these treats can lead to digestive issues, including acid reflux and bloating. Outdoor feasting might even bring unwelcome companions like vomiting and food poisoning.
The joyous Diwali celebrations often lead to late-night gatherings, disrupting our natural sleep cycle. Irregular sleep patterns not only affect mood but can also have serious implications for heart and brain health if prolonged.
The hustle and bustle of Diwali preparations involve extensive physical activity, potentially straining the heart. Combined with indulging in fried foods, this can lead to what is known as the ""festive heart syndrome,"" increasing the risk of heart-related complications, including heart attacks.
Moderation is key when it comes to festive drinks, whether alcoholic or not. Consuming beverages on an empty stomach can cause fluctuations in blood sugar and blood pressure levels. For those dealing with diabetes or hypertension, avoiding alcohol is essential. Additionally, social smoking, often prevalent during festive gatherings, can pose significant health risks that should not be ignored.
As Diwali approaches, air pollution becomes a prevalent concern, particularly in the Delhi-NCR region. Those with asthma or other respiratory issues may experience heightened discomfort, sometimes necessitating emergency medical attention. Noise pollution, amplified by loud music and firecrackers, not only affects humans but also takes a toll on animals, emphasizing the need for a balanced and considerate celebration.

But what is the right air purifier for your home, amidst the wide selection available in the market? An expert shares key tips to keep in mind while shopping for these devices.

Several cities across India have been witnessing growing pollution levels, especially cities in the National Capital Region including Delhi, Noida, Gurgaon and others. Even Mumbai has been witnessing high levels of pollution, as is the case with several other cities in India. And it's not outdoor air that's been affected. Indoor air has become a major source of concern with doctors increasingly suggesting the use of air purifiers. With the market flooded with choices, it's necessary to use one's discretion to buy the right purifier. Ken Armstrong, Air Purification Scientist at Dyson, suggests how to choose the right air purifier to suit your needs.
""Whether we’re sleeping, working, cooking, or exercising, we are potentially breathing dirty air. We can do little to control the quality of the air we breathe outside. But there are ways we can protect our health and wellbeing in our homes. One such way is to invest in an air purifier. The decision to purchase an air purifier could be a positive step towards providing purified air for both you and your family. Purifiers come in various shapes and sizes, remove different kinds of air pollutants in your homes, and offer a wide array of features and specifications,"" says Ken Armstrong. He shares the five important things that one should note before buying an air purifier:
There are different types of filtration and cleaning systems present in purifiers. ""Ultraviolet light, for example, uses electromagnetic radiation to destroy bacteria, viruses and mould but does not remove dust, allergens or particles in the air. Activated carbon filters react chemically with pollutants to clear smoke, odours and gases from the air, but alone do not filter out harmful fine particles. Ionisers work by sending out a stream of charged ions to attract dust and allergens. While fairly popular, it is important to know ionisers can produce ground-level ozone. This raises indoor ozone, which can irritate your lungs,"" says Amstrong. He adds that HEPA H13 standard filters are highly effective at capturing 99.95 per cent of particles as small as 0.1 microns such as allergens, bacteria, H1N1 virus, pollen and mould spores. ""HEPA filters alone, however, will not remove formaldehyde,"" shares Amstrong.
While seemingly fundamental, it is important to be aware of the invisible enemies that we are dealing with in our homes. ""In India, PM2.5 is the most commonly mentioned particle size – which is prevalent in India, almost throughout the year. Particles, unfortunately, do not stop at 2.5 microns. PM0.1 particles, also known as ultra-fine particles, tend to penetrate the fine sacs in our lungs (also known as alveoli) and may even enter our bloodstream easily. Using air purifiers which are fully sealed ensures that no air bypasses the filter and blocks any potential leak points through which dirty air might enter the machines,"" says Amstrong.
To gauge the scale of your needs, measure the approximate length, width and height of your room, and multiply them together to obtain the amount of coverage you require, says Amstrong. He adds, ""Do however bear in mind that the ability to distribute clean air evenly across the room is equally important, as many air purifiers only release air in a singular or upward direction.""
Purifiers can be bulky and heavy, making them difficult to transfer across rooms. ""Light-weight purifiers on the other hand, usually mean that coverage is compromised. There are, however, exceptions to this rule. Certain models of purifiers combine the functionality of a fan with an air purifier, providing the best of both worlds,"" says Armstrong.
For the best results, your air purifier should run continuously. ""If you plan to run your purifier regularly, consider the noise level at the highest and lowest speeds. A volume of less than 30 decibels will allow you to sleep peacefully. If you plan to have an air purifier in your bedroom, consider one that offers a night mode,"" says Amstrong.
Some air purifiers connect to an app from the manufacturer. Amstrong says, ""These apps allow you to control your machine from your smart device. They also provide updates and reports on air quality and alert you when your machine needs maintenance or a filter replacement.""

New Delhi: The Union Health Ministry on Friday updated the advisory for air pollution and directed all the states to implement the same. The ministry has also warned that the rising air pollution may exacerbate the severity of a Covid-19 infection in the patients who are already infected. The ministry also said that the presence of airborne dust particles has the potential to facilitate the transmission of the coronavirus.
As per the government advisory, covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief or cloth is not sufficient to combat pollution. If the Air Quality Index (AQI) exceeds 200, it is advisable to use N95 or N99 masks, especially for short durations, as prolonged use may cause breathing difficulties for some individuals.
Consider using air purifiers when the air quality is above 200. Refrain from conducting indoor Havan ceremonies. If you use air conditioning in your car or home, set it to recirculate mode to keep indoor air inside. Avoid burning incense sticks and mosquito coils.
Citing data from ICMR, the government reported that in 2019, 18% of deaths in India were attributed to air pollution, resulting in a loss of eleven and a half years of life on average. The government recognizes that prolonged exposure to high pollution levels increases the risk of heart disease, respiratory issues, and diseases such as brain and lung cancer.
The impact of air pollution can be particularly hazardous for specific groups, including children under 5 years old, pregnant women, individuals involved in outdoor occupations like traffic management, and those who are already unwell.

New Delhi: Until yesterday, Delhi NCR's AQI lingered at 400, causing concern. However, recent winds and overnight rain have brought relief, easing the worries of Delhi residents. Unfortunately, neither state governments nor the strong words of the Supreme Court have provided immediate relief from pollution. The rain and wind have finally reduced AQI in Delhi to below 400 after 8 days. Presently, the AQI hovers between 200 to 250, offering a respite.
In Today's DNA, Zee News anchor Sourabh Raaj Jain analysed the effectiveness of Delhi Government's measures to combat air pollution in the national capital. Although AQI is assessed on a 24-hour basis, the smog has dispersed due to the rain. The weather department predicts this favorable condition to persist for the next one or two days.
Given Delhi's pollution crisis, the Supreme Court remains firm. Today's hearing echoed past reprimands as the Court criticized the Delhi government. It questioned the lack of concrete anti-pollution measures over the last 6 years and why actions are reactive, relying on court intervention rather than proactive preparation
The government touted the odd-even formula as an effective pollution reduction strategy, citing a study. Delhi's government listed its benefits in the name of pollution control. However, the Supreme Court had previously deemed it inadequate, urging the Delhi government to explore alternative solutions. It appears the government lacks options beyond odd-even to combat pollution. Although the plan was initially set for post-Diwali implementation, it is currently postponed.
To alleviate pollution in Delhi, the Delhi government had planned for artificial rain, but currently, this initiative is on hold. If pollution escalates post-Diwali, the implementation of artificial rain remains a possibility.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's ambitious scheme for combating pollution during the winter season is about to make a comeback once again. While the Delhi government has expressed a desire to implement the scheme from November 13 for a week, the proposal is on hold as of now after the Supreme Court questioned the move. The Supreme Court questioned the Delhi Government’s decision to impose the odd-even scheme for private vehicles in Delhi tering the odd-even as 'all optics'.
Meanwhile, a survey by the Local Circle has revealed that a majority of Delhites are not in favour of the scheme. The 2023 survey asked Delhi NCR residents whether they support the Odd-Even scheme. ""Out of 10,644 respondents, 36% or around one-third stated 'yes' and 64% stated 'no'. To sum up, 64% of Delhi NCR residents surveyed do not support the introduction of Odd-Even vehicle rule as a solution to air pollution,"" revealed the survey.
The respondents shared their concerns regarding the scheme as well. ""The biggest group of 56% indicated that 'two-wheelers', which account for a large number of vehicles on the road, should not be exempt; 44% opposed exemption to 'women drivers alone or with child up to 12 years of age'; 44% indicated 'vehicles with person/s with physical disabilities'; 33% indicated 'private vehicles with school children in uniform (only during school timings)'; 22% indicated 'electric vehicles' and 22% of respondents indicated 'other exemptions not listed above'. To sum up, 56% of Delhi-NCR residents surveyed are opposed to 1 or more exemptions in Odd-Even vehicle rule implementation,"" said the survey.
First implemented by the Kejriwal-led government in 2016, the odd-even rule, which allows private four-wheelers to be driven only on alternate days according to the last digit of their number plate, had limited impact mainly due to the many exemptions. Odd and Even system for private cars in 2016 for two weeks had led to inconvenience for many, some even buying a new vehicle and many finding car-pool partners to travel to their workplace. While it led to smoother traffic, the impact on pollution was marginal.
The survey received over 21,000 responses from residents of Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram & Faridabad. 63% of respondents were men while 37% of respondents were women.

But toxic air does eyes great harm and essential steps need to be taken to keep eyes healthy and vision perfect.
Trending Photos
Growing air pollution in Delhi and surrounding cities like Noida, Gurgaon, Faridabad, and Ghaziabad, have left residents and health experts worried. And it's not just Delhi-NCR, several cities across India have been reeling under the impact of toxic air. Dr Maramganty Vamshidhar, Senior Cataract and Refractive Surgeon, Maxivision Eye Hospital, Somajiguda, Hyderabad, says, ""Air pollution is a pressing global concern with far-reaching health implications. While most of us are aware of its effects on our respiratory system, we often overlook its impact on our eyes."" In this article, the doctor explains the ways in which air pollution affects our eyes, the problems it can cause, warning signs to look out for, and practical steps to follow in order to take care of our precious vision.
Dr Maramganty Vamshidhar lists the following impacts of air pollution on the eyes:
1. Irritation and Dryness: Polluted air is laden with tiny particulate matter, chemicals, and toxins that can irritate the eyes. When these pollutants come into contact with the delicate surface of our eyes, they can cause redness, itching, and a gritty feeling. Prolonged exposure may result in chronic dry eyes.
2. Allergic Reactions: Allergens which are airborne like pollen and mold spores can attach themselves to pollution particles, thereby forming a potent allergenic mix. This can lead to allergic reactions in the eyes, leading to symptoms such as itching, tearing, and swollen eyelids.
3. Increased Risk of Eye Infections: Air pollution weakens the eye's natural defence mechanisms. This makes the eyes more vulnerable to infections, as pollutants can compromise the integrity of the protective tear film and make it easier for bacteria or viruses to enter the eye.
Air pollution can lead to following eye issues, Dr Vamshidhar points out:
1. Conjunctivitis: Also known as ""pink eye,"" conjunctivitis is a common eye condition often caused by viral or bacterial infections. Air pollution can weaken the eye's defences because of exposure to pollutants and can increase one's likelihood of developing conjunctivitis.
2. Dry Eye Syndrome: Prolonged exposure to air pollution can lead to dry eye syndrome, a condition in which the eyes do not produce enough tears or the tears evaporate too quickly. This can result in discomfort, blurred vision, and an increased risk of corneal damage.
3. Cataracts: Yes, you read that right! Air pollution can contribute to the development and progression of cataracts. Prolonged exposure to air pollution has been linked to an increased risk of developing this clouding of the eye's natural lens, leading to impaired vision.
4. Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD): Air pollution's oxidative stress can accelerate the progression of AMD, a leading cause of vision loss among older adults. AMD affects the macula, and the central part of the retina, and impairs central vision.
1. Persistent redness, itching, or burning sensation in the eyes.
2. Frequent tearing or watery eyes.
3. Gritty feeling, as if there's something in your eye.
4. Blurred or fluctuating vision.
5. Sensitivity to light.
6. Eye discharge or crust in the morning.
7. Difficulty in focusing or seeing clearly, especially at night.
While you might not be able to control outdoor pollution, you can take certain steps to keep your eyes healthy. Dr Vamshidhar suggests the following steps:
1. Use Artificial Tears: Lubricating eye drops can help alleviate dryness and discomfort caused by pollution. Use preservative-free artificial tears as needed.
2. Wear Protective Eyewear: Consider wearing wrap-around sunglasses to shield your eyes from pollutants and allergens when outdoors, especially on high-pollution days.
3. Stay Hydrated: Proper hydration helps maintain the tear film's integrity. Drink enough water to prevent dry eyes.
4. Avoid Rubbing Your Eyes: Rubbing can exacerbate irritation and introduce germs into your eyes. If your eyes are irritated, use clean hands or a sterile eyewash to rinse them.
5. Maintain Good Indoor Air Quality: Use air purifiers and keep windows closed during days of high pollution to reduce indoor exposure.
6. Regular Eye Check-ups: Visit an eye care professional for regular check-ups, especially if you experience persistent eye discomfort or vision changes.
Dr Vamshidhar points out the following dos and don'ts:
1. Do wear protective eyewear when necessary.
2. Do wash your hands frequently to prevent introducing germs to your eyes.
3. Do seek professional help if you experience persistent eye issues.
4. Do stay informed about air quality in your area and take precautions on high pollution days.
1. Don't rub your eyes when they are irritated.
2. Don't ignore warning signs of eye problems.
3. Don't smoke, as it can worsen eye conditions and increase the risk of cataracts.
4. Don't use redness-relief eye drops without a doctor's recommendation, as they can mask underlying issues.
""Air pollution is a silent threat to our eyesight, and its effects should not be underestimated. By understanding how pollution impacts our eyes, recognising warning signs, and taking the necessary precautions, we can protect our vision and ensure a healthier future for our eyes. It's essential to stay proactive, take care of our eyes, and advocate for cleaner air to reduce the long-term impact of air pollution on our eye health,"" Dr Vamshidhar signs off.

Even as air quality remains in 'severe' category in Delhi, experts said that breathing polluted air can significantly hurt reproductive health. On Thursday morning, air quality across Delhi remained in the 'severe' category.
The Anand Vihar station was in the 'severe' category with PM 2.5 at 500 and PM 10 at 459, while the Carbon Monoxide (CO) was at 85 and the NO2 at 57, both in 'satisfactory' levels, as per CPCB at 9 a.m.
""Amid NCR's prolonged air pollution crisis, expecting mothers find themselves at the forefront of its adverse effects. The delicate particulate matter in the air has potential repercussions on foetal development, contributing to issues like low birth weight and preterm birth,"" Dr Shweta Wazir, Consultant - Obstetrician & Gynaecologist, Motherhood Hospitals, Gurugram, told IANS.

In addition, Wazir said that the constant exposure to pollution heightens stress and anxiety levels, impacting the mental well-being of pregnant women. ""As their immune systems become compromised, the risk of infections during pregnancy rises,"" she said.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives showed that certain pollutants can negatively alter anogenital distance, a measure of prenatal exposure to hormones. Researchers at the Rutgers University in the US suggest that air pollution can interfere with normal hormone activity during critical periods of prenatal and early infant development.
This disruption may have long-term consequences for reproductive health, they said. Air pollution is a major public health concern. The hazardous air quality poses significant respiratory risks, increasing the likelihood of complications such as asthma and bronchitis. However, pregnant and expecting women are particularly vulnerable to its harmful effects. It is because, ""pregnant and expecting women are breathing for two.
The placenta, which is the organ that connects the mother to the foetus, is permeable to air pollutants. And the foetus, which is developing rapidly, is more vulnerable to the effects of environmental toxins. Exposure to air pollution during pregnancy has been linked to several adverse health outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight, congenital heart defects, asthma, and autism spectrum disorder,"" Dr Priyanka Suhag, Consultant, Dept of Obstetrics & Gynaecology at the CK Birla Hospital (R), Delhi, told IANS.
Nisha Bhatnagar, MBBS. MD (ObGyn), Medical Director, Infinite Fertility added that daily exposure to high pollution levels is increasingly recognised as a significant contributor to declining fertility.
Besides women's reproductive health, prolonged exposure to bad air also affects men's sperm quality.
""Deteriorating air quality not only affects respiratory health but also leads to reduced sexual drive among couples trying to conceive. Exposure to air with estrogenic and antiandrogenic substances can impair testosterone and sperm production,"" the doctor told IANS.
Air pollution can be a silent adversary to fertility, affecting both men and women. The toxins in polluted air may disrupt hormonal balance and impair reproductive health. The experts suggested limiting outdoor activities during times when air pollution levels are highest, focus on a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management to support overall health, and engage in activities like prenatal yoga and meditation for stress relief.
""To protect your fertility, consider wearing masks in highly polluted areas. Prioritising a healthy lifestyle, with a balanced diet and regular exercise, can also mitigate the impact of air pollution. Awareness, precaution, and timely interventions are our allies in the fight for reproductive well-being,"" Dr. Lavi Sodhi, Consultant, MBBS, DNB (Obstetrics and Gynaecology), Birla Fertility & IVF, Lajpat Nagar, told IANS.

Air pollution levels across major cities in India have been deteriorating as the winter season approaches and post-Diwali, the condition worsened especially in Delhi-NCR. Air pollution can lead to many health complications, affecting lung health as well as leading to cardiovascular diseases. But according to experts, prolonged exposure can also make one more vulnerable to diseases like cancer. Dr Akshat Malik, Head & Neck Cancer Surgeon, Max Super Specialty Hospital, Saket, New Delhi, shares, ""Air pollution can contribute to the development of cancer through various mechanisms, primarily by introducing or promoting harmful substances in the body.""
Dr Akshat Malik shares some of the ways in which air pollution can lead to cancer:
Introduction of Carcinogens: Air pollution contains a mixture of chemicals, some of which are known carcinogens (substances that can cause cancer). For example, particulate matter (especially fine particles like PM2.5) can carry carcinogenic compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), into the respiratory system when inhaled. These chemicals can then come into contact with lung tissue, potentially leading to DNA damage and mutations that may initiate cancerous growth.
Inflammation and Oxidative Stress: Exposure to certain components of air pollution, like PM2.5 and ozone (O3), can lead to inflammation and oxidative stress in the body. Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress can disrupt cellular processes and DNA repair mechanisms, increasing the risk of genetic mutations and the development of cancer.
DNA Damage: Some chemicals in air pollution can directly interact with DNA, causing damage. This damage may interfere with the normal functioning of cells and increase the likelihood of uncontrolled cell growth, a hallmark of cancer.
Promotion Of Tumour Growth: Air pollution can create an environment in the body that is conducive to the growth of tumours. For example, certain pollutants can stimulate the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) around tumours, providing them with a steady supply of nutrients and oxygen.
Weakening Of Immune Response: Prolonged exposure to air pollution can weaken the immune system's ability to recognise and eliminate abnormal or cancerous cells. This can allow cancer cells to evade immune surveillance and proliferate.
Alteration Of Hormonal Balance: Some components of air pollution, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals, can interfere with the body's hormonal balance. This disruption can potentially lead to hormonal changes that promote the development of hormone-related cancers, like breast and prostate cancer.
Synergistic Effects With Other Risk Factors: Air pollution can interact with other risk factors, such as tobacco smoke or occupational exposures, to increase the overall risk of cancer. For example, exposure to both tobacco smoke and air pollution can have a synergistic effect on lung cancer risk.
""It's important to note that the specific mechanisms and the extent of their contribution to cancer risk may vary depending on the type and concentration of pollutants, individual susceptibility, and other environmental and genetic factors. Reducing exposure to air pollution and adopting measures to improve air quality are crucial steps in reducing the associated cancer risks. Additionally, early detection and intervention remain important in managing and treating cancer,"" says Dr Akshat Malik.

As Diwali celebrations peak, card parties bring a spread of tempting sweets and snacks. The festive allure, coupled with chilly weather, enhances the Diwali charm. However, overindulgence and smog can jeopardize well-being, disrupting the festive spirit. It's crucial to exercise caution in daily activities to safeguard your health and sustain the festive joy.
Post-Diwali, Delhi-NCR's air quality has significantly deteriorated, falling into the 'poor' category on Monday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). This comes after the city was engulfed in a thick layer of smog following the bursting of firecrackers on Diwali night.
1. Long-term Health Impacts
Prolonged exposure to air pollution is a leading cause of respiratory issues, contributing to cardiovascular problems, pulmonary insufficiency, and chronic asthma. Pregnant women are particularly advised to avoid strenuous activity in areas with poor air quality, as prolonged exposure may lead to complications.
2. Environmental Effect
Air pollution is contributing to a global rise in temperatures, resulting in the melting of icebergs and glaciers in polar regions. The annual melting of 1.2 trillion tonnes of ice translates into water that directly flows into our oceans. The long-term consequences of air pollution from fireworks have the potential to exacerbate the climate crisis, posing a serious threat to our environment.
Dr Farah Ingale, Senior consultant Physician & Diabetologist, Fortis Hiranandani Hospital, Vashi, Navi Mumbai shares
Diwali's festive cheer brings with it a tempting array of snacks and sweets, making overeating almost irresistible. Indulging in these treats can lead to digestive issues, including acid reflux and bloating. Outdoor feasting might even bring unwelcome companions like vomiting and food poisoning.
The joyous Diwali celebrations often lead to late-night gatherings, disrupting our natural sleep cycle. Irregular sleep patterns not only affect mood but can also have serious implications for heart and brain health if prolonged.
The hustle and bustle of Diwali preparations involve extensive physical activity, potentially straining the heart. Combined with indulging in fried foods, this can lead to what is known as the ""festive heart syndrome,"" increasing the risk of heart-related complications, including heart attacks.
Moderation is key when it comes to festive drinks, whether alcoholic or not. Consuming beverages on an empty stomach can cause fluctuations in blood sugar and blood pressure levels. For those dealing with diabetes or hypertension, avoiding alcohol is essential. Additionally, social smoking, often prevalent during festive gatherings, can pose significant health risks that should not be ignored.
As Diwali approaches, air pollution becomes a prevalent concern, particularly in the Delhi-NCR region. Those with asthma or other respiratory issues may experience heightened discomfort, sometimes necessitating emergency medical attention. Noise pollution, amplified by loud music and firecrackers, not only affects humans but also takes a toll on animals, emphasizing the need for a balanced and considerate celebration.

Air pollution, a pervasive threat in our environment, endangers individuals of all ages, but it particularly affects the very young and the elderly due to their relatively weaker immune systems. The elderly often have comorbid conditions that put them at greater risk of developing severe health problems when exposed to polluted air.
Dr Sandeep Nayar, Principal director & HOD, Pulmonology, BLK-Max Super Speciality Hospital spoke to Zee News English about some of the must-followed measures for elderly care during the poor air quality crisis in Delhi-NCR and other regions affected by the air pollution.
To ensure the well-being of elderly parents, it is crucial to shield them from polluted environments, as prevention is always better than cure. Here are some tips shared by Dr Sandeep Nayar for a easy elderly care at home:
1. Encourage Indoor Stay: Advise your elderly loved ones to stay indoors as much as possible to avoid exposure to harmful pollutants. Indoor spaces generally have better air quality, reducing the risk of respiratory issues.
2. Use Protective Measures: If venturing outside is necessary, ensure that they are appropriately protected. Encourage them to wear face masks to filter out pollutants and to cover themselves adequately to limit direct contact with polluted air.
3. Timing Matters: Discourage early morning walks or outdoor exercise. During physical activities, individuals tend to breathe more rapidly and deeply, increasing the intake of harmful air pollutants. Opt for indoor exercise routines instead.
4. Indoor Air Quality: Maintain clean indoor air by keeping the room clean and ensuring that windows and doors remain closed to prevent outdoor pollutants from entering. Consider using an air purifier with the appropriate filtration system to further improve indoor air quality.
5. Prevent Indoor Pollution: Avoid the use of candles, incense sticks, or any other sources of indoor pollution. These can release particulate matter and other harmful substances into the air, exacerbating respiratory issues.
6. Healthy Diet and Hydration: Encourage a nutritious diet that supports their immune system. Ensure they drink an adequate amount of water to stay hydrated, as this is essential for overall health.
7. Medication Compliance: Remind your elderly parents not to miss any prescribed medications. Consistency in medication is crucial for managing chronic conditions. In case of any health issues or concerns, they should immediately consult their physician for potential adjustments to their medication regimen.
Caring for elderly parents at home involves taking proactive steps to safeguard their health, particularly in the face of environmental challenges like air pollution. By following these essential measures, you can help ensure that your loved ones continue to lead a healthy and happy life, free from the adverse effects of air pollution.

New Delhi: Delhi on Sunday recorded the best Air Quality in the past Eight years on Diwali, however, Firecrackers and Low Night Temperatures Pose Pollution RiskOn Diwali evening, the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) in the national capital remained in the ""poor"" category, however compared to previous years, this Diwali the AQI was not touching a grim milestone. Anand Vihar station, a notable hotspot, reported a ""poor"" category with PM 10 at 272 and PM 2.5 at 240. The CO level was at 62, and NO2 stood at 363, both falling under the ""satisfactory"" category according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) at 7 p.m.
Meanwhile, at the Bawana station, PM 10 recorded 127, categorizing it as ""poor,"" while PM 2.5 at 99 was classified as ""moderate."" The CO level was 62, and NO2 was 63, both falling under the ""satisfactory"" category.
Based on data from the Central Pollution Control Board, the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi was 312 on Diwali in 2022, 382 in 2021, 414 in 2020, 337 in 2019, 281 in 2018, 319 in 2017, and 431 in 201 while on Saturday, the 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) marked 220, the lowest recorded on the day preceding Diwali in the past eight years.
The air quality in Delhi exhibited significant improvement just ahead of the festival, attributed to intermittent rain on Friday and favorable wind speeds that facilitated the dispersion of pollutants. In contrast, the 24-hour average AQI on Thursday stood at 437. Over the preceding two weeks, from October 28, the air quality in the city had ranged from 'very poor' to 'severe,' contributing to a dense smog that enveloped the capital during this period.
In the case of the Dwarka Sector-8 station, PM 10 reached 114, placing it in the ""moderate"" category, and PM 2.5 was at 95, categorized as ""satisfactory."" The air quality at the Indira Gandhi International Airport T3 area was in the ""moderate"" category with PM 2.5 at 116 and PM 10 at 99, in the ""satisfactory"" category.

Indoor air has become a major source of concern with doctors increasingly suggesting the use of air purifiers. With the market flooded with choices, it's necessary to use one's discretion to buy the right purifier. Ken Armstrong, Air Purification Scientist at Dyson, suggests how to choose the right air purifier to suit your needs.
""Whether we’re sleeping, working, cooking, or exercising, we are potentially breathing dirty air. We can do little to control the quality of the air we breathe outside. But there are ways we can protect our health and wellbeing in our homes. One such way is to invest in an air purifier. The decision to purchase an air purifier could be a positive step towards providing purified air for both you and your family. Purifiers come in various shapes and sizes, remove different kinds of air pollutants in your homes, and offer a wide array of features and specifications,"" says Ken Armstrong. He shares the five important things that one should note before buying an air purifier:
There are different types of filtration and cleaning systems present in purifiers. ""Ultraviolet light, for example, uses electromagnetic radiation to destroy bacteria, viruses and mould but does not remove dust, allergens or particles in the air. Activated carbon filters react chemically with pollutants to clear smoke, odours and gases from the air, but alone do not filter out harmful fine particles. Ionisers work by sending out a stream of charged ions to attract dust and allergens. While fairly popular, it is important to know ionisers can produce ground-level ozone. This raises indoor ozone, which can irritate your lungs,"" says Amstrong. He adds that HEPA H13 standard filters are highly effective at capturing 99.95 per cent of particles as small as 0.1 microns such as allergens, bacteria, H1N1 virus, pollen and mould spores. ""HEPA filters alone, however, will not remove formaldehyde,"" shares Amstrong.
While seemingly fundamental, it is important to be aware of the invisible enemies that we are dealing with in our homes. ""In India, PM2.5 is the most commonly mentioned particle size – which is prevalent in India, almost throughout the year. Particles, unfortunately, do not stop at 2.5 microns. PM0.1 particles, also known as ultra-fine particles, tend to penetrate the fine sacs in our lungs (also known as alveoli) and may even enter our bloodstream easily. Using air purifiers which are fully sealed ensures that no air bypasses the filter and blocks any potential leak points through which dirty air might enter the machines,"" says Amstrong.
To gauge the scale of your needs, measure the approximate length, width and height of your room, and multiply them together to obtain the amount of coverage you require, says Amstrong. He adds, ""Do however bear in mind that the ability to distribute clean air evenly across the room is equally important, as many air purifiers only release air in a singular or upward direction.""
Purifiers can be bulky and heavy, making them difficult to transfer across rooms. ""Light-weight purifiers on the other hand, usually mean that coverage is compromised. There are, however, exceptions to this rule. Certain models of purifiers combine the functionality of a fan with an air purifier, providing the best of both worlds,"" says Armstrong.
For the best results, your air purifier should run continuously. ""If you plan to run your purifier regularly, consider the noise level at the highest and lowest speeds. A volume of less than 30 decibels will allow you to sleep peacefully. If you plan to have an air purifier in your bedroom, consider one that offers a night mode,"" says Amstrong.
Some air purifiers connect to an app from the manufacturer. Amstrong says, ""These apps allow you to control your machine from your smart device. They also provide updates and reports on air quality and alert you when your machine needs maintenance or a filter replacement.""

New Delhi: The Union Health Ministry on Friday updated the advisory for air pollution and directed all the states to implement the same. The ministry has also warned that the rising air pollution may exacerbate the severity of a Covid-19 infection in the patients who are already infected. The ministry also said that the presence of airborne dust particles has the potential to facilitate the transmission of the coronavirus.
As per the government advisory, covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief or cloth is not sufficient to combat pollution. If the Air Quality Index (AQI) exceeds 200, it is advisable to use N95 or N99 masks, especially for short durations, as prolonged use may cause breathing difficulties for some individuals.
Consider using air purifiers when the air quality is above 200. Refrain from conducting indoor Havan ceremonies. If you use air conditioning in your car or home, set it to recirculate mode to keep indoor air inside. Avoid burning incense sticks and mosquito coils.
Citing data from ICMR, the government reported that in 2019, 18% of deaths in India were attributed to air pollution, resulting in a loss of eleven and a half years of life on average. The government recognizes that prolonged exposure to high pollution levels increases the risk of heart disease, respiratory issues, and diseases such as brain and lung cancer.
The impact of air pollution can be particularly hazardous for specific groups, including children under 5 years old, pregnant women, individuals involved in outdoor occupations like traffic management, and those who are already unwell.

New Delhi: Until yesterday, Delhi NCR's AQI lingered at 400, causing concern. However, recent winds and overnight rain have brought relief, easing the worries of Delhi residents. Unfortunately, neither state governments nor the strong words of the Supreme Court have provided immediate relief from pollution. The rain and wind have finally reduced AQI in Delhi to below 400 after 8 days. Presently, the AQI hovers between 200 to 250, offering a respite.
In Today's DNA, Zee News anchor Sourabh Raaj Jain analysed the effectiveness of Delhi Government's measures to combat air pollution in the national capital. Although AQI is assessed on a 24-hour basis, the smog has dispersed due to the rain. The weather department predicts this favorable condition to persist for the next one or two days.
Given Delhi's pollution crisis, the Supreme Court remains firm. Today's hearing echoed past reprimands as the Court criticized the Delhi government. It questioned the lack of concrete anti-pollution measures over the last 6 years and why actions are reactive, relying on court intervention rather than proactive preparation
The government touted the odd-even formula as an effective pollution reduction strategy, citing a study. Delhi's government listed its benefits in the name of pollution control. However, the Supreme Court had previously deemed it inadequate, urging the Delhi government to explore alternative solutions. It appears the government lacks options beyond odd-even to combat pollution. Although the plan was initially set for post-Diwali implementation, it is currently postponed.
To alleviate pollution in Delhi, the Delhi government had planned for artificial rain, but currently, this initiative is on hold. If pollution escalates post-Diwali, the implementation of artificial rain remains a possibility.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's ambitious scheme for combating pollution during the winter season is about to make a comeback once again. While the Delhi government has expressed a desire to implement the scheme from November 13 for a week, the proposal is on hold as of now after the Supreme Court questioned the move. The Supreme Court questioned the Delhi Government’s decision to impose the odd-even scheme for private vehicles in Delhi tering the odd-even as 'all optics'.
Meanwhile, a survey by the Local Circle has revealed that a majority of Delhites are not in favour of the scheme. The 2023 survey asked Delhi NCR residents whether they support the Odd-Even scheme. ""Out of 10,644 respondents, 36% or around one-third stated 'yes' and 64% stated 'no'. To sum up, 64% of Delhi NCR residents surveyed do not support the introduction of Odd-Even vehicle rule as a solution to air pollution,"" revealed the survey.
The respondents shared their concerns regarding the scheme as well. ""The biggest group of 56% indicated that 'two-wheelers', which account for a large number of vehicles on the road, should not be exempt; 44% opposed exemption to 'women drivers alone or with child up to 12 years of age'; 44% indicated 'vehicles with person/s with physical disabilities'; 33% indicated 'private vehicles with school children in uniform (only during school timings)'; 22% indicated 'electric vehicles' and 22% of respondents indicated 'other exemptions not listed above'. To sum up, 56% of Delhi-NCR residents surveyed are opposed to 1 or more exemptions in Odd-Even vehicle rule implementation,"" said the survey.
First implemented by the Kejriwal-led government in 2016, the odd-even rule, which allows private four-wheelers to be driven only on alternate days according to the last digit of their number plate, had limited impact mainly due to the many exemptions. Odd and Even system for private cars in 2016 for two weeks had led to inconvenience for many, some even buying a new vehicle and many finding car-pool partners to travel to their workplace. While it led to smoother traffic, the impact on pollution was marginal.
The survey received over 21,000 responses from residents of Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram & Faridabad. 63% of respondents were men while 37% of respondents were women.

But toxic air does eyes great harm and essential steps need to be taken to keep eyes healthy and vision perfect.
Trending Photos
Growing air pollution in Delhi and surrounding cities like Noida, Gurgaon, Faridabad, and Ghaziabad, have left residents and health experts worried. And it's not just Delhi-NCR, several cities across India have been reeling under the impact of toxic air. Dr Maramganty Vamshidhar, Senior Cataract and Refractive Surgeon, Maxivision Eye Hospital, Somajiguda, Hyderabad, says, ""Air pollution is a pressing global concern with far-reaching health implications. While most of us are aware of its effects on our respiratory system, we often overlook its impact on our eyes."" In this article, the doctor explains the ways in which air pollution affects our eyes, the problems it can cause, warning signs to look out for, and practical steps to follow in order to take care of our precious vision.
Dr Maramganty Vamshidhar lists the following impacts of air pollution on the eyes:
1. Irritation and Dryness: Polluted air is laden with tiny particulate matter, chemicals, and toxins that can irritate the eyes. When these pollutants come into contact with the delicate surface of our eyes, they can cause redness, itching, and a gritty feeling. Prolonged exposure may result in chronic dry eyes.
2. Allergic Reactions: Allergens which are airborne like pollen and mold spores can attach themselves to pollution particles, thereby forming a potent allergenic mix. This can lead to allergic reactions in the eyes, leading to symptoms such as itching, tearing, and swollen eyelids.
3. Increased Risk of Eye Infections: Air pollution weakens the eye's natural defence mechanisms. This makes the eyes more vulnerable to infections, as pollutants can compromise the integrity of the protective tear film and make it easier for bacteria or viruses to enter the eye.
Air pollution can lead to following eye issues, Dr Vamshidhar points out:
1. Conjunctivitis: Also known as ""pink eye,"" conjunctivitis is a common eye condition often caused by viral or bacterial infections. Air pollution can weaken the eye's defences because of exposure to pollutants and can increase one's likelihood of developing conjunctivitis.
2. Dry Eye Syndrome: Prolonged exposure to air pollution can lead to dry eye syndrome, a condition in which the eyes do not produce enough tears or the tears evaporate too quickly. This can result in discomfort, blurred vision, and an increased risk of corneal damage.
3. Cataracts: Yes, you read that right! Air pollution can contribute to the development and progression of cataracts. Prolonged exposure to air pollution has been linked to an increased risk of developing this clouding of the eye's natural lens, leading to impaired vision.
4. Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD): Air pollution's oxidative stress can accelerate the progression of AMD, a leading cause of vision loss among older adults. AMD affects the macula, and the central part of the retina, and impairs central vision.
1. Persistent redness, itching, or burning sensation in the eyes.
2. Frequent tearing or watery eyes.
3. Gritty feeling, as if there's something in your eye.
4. Blurred or fluctuating vision.
5. Sensitivity to light.
6. Eye discharge or crust in the morning.
7. Difficulty in focusing or seeing clearly, especially at night.
While you might not be able to control outdoor pollution, you can take certain steps to keep your eyes healthy. Dr Vamshidhar suggests the following steps:
1. Use Artificial Tears: Lubricating eye drops can help alleviate dryness and discomfort caused by pollution. Use preservative-free artificial tears as needed.
2. Wear Protective Eyewear: Consider wearing wrap-around sunglasses to shield your eyes from pollutants and allergens when outdoors, especially on high-pollution days.
3. Stay Hydrated: Proper hydration helps maintain the tear film's integrity. Drink enough water to prevent dry eyes.
4. Avoid Rubbing Your Eyes: Rubbing can exacerbate irritation and introduce germs into your eyes. If your eyes are irritated, use clean hands or a sterile eyewash to rinse them.
5. Maintain Good Indoor Air Quality: Use air purifiers and keep windows closed during days of high pollution to reduce indoor exposure.
6. Regular Eye Check-ups: Visit an eye care professional for regular check-ups, especially if you experience persistent eye discomfort or vision changes.
Dr Vamshidhar points out the following dos and don'ts:
1. Do wear protective eyewear when necessary.
2. Do wash your hands frequently to prevent introducing germs to your eyes.
3. Do seek professional help if you experience persistent eye issues.
4. Do stay informed about air quality in your area and take precautions on high pollution days.
1. Don't rub your eyes when they are irritated.
2. Don't ignore warning signs of eye problems.
3. Don't smoke, as it can worsen eye conditions and increase the risk of cataracts.
4. Don't use redness-relief eye drops without a doctor's recommendation, as they can mask underlying issues.
""Air pollution is a silent threat to our eyesight, and its effects should not be underestimated. By understanding how pollution impacts our eyes, recognising warning signs, and taking the necessary precautions, we can protect our vision and ensure a healthier future for our eyes. It's essential to stay proactive, take care of our eyes, and advocate for cleaner air to reduce the long-term impact of air pollution on our eye health,"" Dr Vamshidhar signs off.

Even as air quality remains in 'severe' category in Delhi, experts said that breathing polluted air can significantly hurt reproductive health. On Thursday morning, air quality across Delhi remained in the 'severe' category.
The Anand Vihar station was in the 'severe' category with PM 2.5 at 500 and PM 10 at 459, while the Carbon Monoxide (CO) was at 85 and the NO2 at 57, both in 'satisfactory' levels, as per CPCB at 9 a.m.
""Amid NCR's prolonged air pollution crisis, expecting mothers find themselves at the forefront of its adverse effects. The delicate particulate matter in the air has potential repercussions on foetal development, contributing to issues like low birth weight and preterm birth,"" Dr Shweta Wazir, Consultant - Obstetrician & Gynaecologist, Motherhood Hospitals, Gurugram, told IANS.

In addition, Wazir said that the constant exposure to pollution heightens stress and anxiety levels, impacting the mental well-being of pregnant women. ""As their immune systems become compromised, the risk of infections during pregnancy rises,"" she said.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives showed that certain pollutants can negatively alter anogenital distance, a measure of prenatal exposure to hormones. Researchers at the Rutgers University in the US suggest that air pollution can interfere with normal hormone activity during critical periods of prenatal and early infant development.
This disruption may have long-term consequences for reproductive health, they said. Air pollution is a major public health concern. The hazardous air quality poses significant respiratory risks, increasing the likelihood of complications such as asthma and bronchitis. However, pregnant and expecting women are particularly vulnerable to its harmful effects. It is because, ""pregnant and expecting women are breathing for two.
The placenta, which is the organ that connects the mother to the foetus, is permeable to air pollutants. And the foetus, which is developing rapidly, is more vulnerable to the effects of environmental toxins. Exposure to air pollution during pregnancy has been linked to several adverse health outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight, congenital heart defects, asthma, and autism spectrum disorder,"" Dr Priyanka Suhag, Consultant, Dept of Obstetrics & Gynaecology at the CK Birla Hospital (R), Delhi, told IANS.
Nisha Bhatnagar, MBBS. MD (ObGyn), Medical Director, Infinite Fertility added that daily exposure to high pollution levels is increasingly recognised as a significant contributor to declining fertility.
Besides women's reproductive health, prolonged exposure to bad air also affects men's sperm quality.
""Deteriorating air quality not only affects respiratory health but also leads to reduced sexual drive among couples trying to conceive. Exposure to air with estrogenic and antiandrogenic substances can impair testosterone and sperm production,"" the doctor told IANS.
Air pollution can be a silent adversary to fertility, affecting both men and women. The toxins in polluted air may disrupt hormonal balance and impair reproductive health. The experts suggested limiting outdoor activities during times when air pollution levels are highest, focus on a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management to support overall health, and engage in activities like prenatal yoga and meditation for stress relief.
""To protect your fertility, consider wearing masks in highly polluted areas. Prioritising a healthy lifestyle, with a balanced diet and regular exercise, can also mitigate the impact of air pollution. Awareness, precaution, and timely interventions are our allies in the fight for reproductive well-being,"" Dr. Lavi Sodhi, Consultant, MBBS, DNB (Obstetrics and Gynaecology), Birla Fertility & IVF, Lajpat Nagar, told IANS.

Air pollution levels across major cities in India have been deteriorating as the winter season approaches and post-Diwali, the condition worsened especially in Delhi-NCR. Air pollution can lead to many health complications, affecting lung health as well as leading to cardiovascular diseases. But according to experts, prolonged exposure can also make one more vulnerable to diseases like cancer. Dr Akshat Malik, Head & Neck Cancer Surgeon, Max Super Specialty Hospital, Saket, New Delhi, shares, ""Air pollution can contribute to the development of cancer through various mechanisms, primarily by introducing or promoting harmful substances in the body.""
Dr Akshat Malik shares some of the ways in which air pollution can lead to cancer:
Introduction of Carcinogens: Air pollution contains a mixture of chemicals, some of which are known carcinogens (substances that can cause cancer). For example, particulate matter (especially fine particles like PM2.5) can carry carcinogenic compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), into the respiratory system when inhaled. These chemicals can then come into contact with lung tissue, potentially leading to DNA damage and mutations that may initiate cancerous growth.
Inflammation and Oxidative Stress: Exposure to certain components of air pollution, like PM2.5 and ozone (O3), can lead to inflammation and oxidative stress in the body. Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress can disrupt cellular processes and DNA repair mechanisms, increasing the risk of genetic mutations and the development of cancer.
DNA Damage: Some chemicals in air pollution can directly interact with DNA, causing damage. This damage may interfere with the normal functioning of cells and increase the likelihood of uncontrolled cell growth, a hallmark of cancer.
Promotion Of Tumour Growth: Air pollution can create an environment in the body that is conducive to the growth of tumours. For example, certain pollutants can stimulate the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) around tumours, providing them with a steady supply of nutrients and oxygen.
Weakening Of Immune Response: Prolonged exposure to air pollution can weaken the immune system's ability to recognise and eliminate abnormal or cancerous cells. This can allow cancer cells to evade immune surveillance and proliferate.
Alteration Of Hormonal Balance: Some components of air pollution, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals, can interfere with the body's hormonal balance. This disruption can potentially lead to hormonal changes that promote the development of hormone-related cancers, like breast and prostate cancer.
Synergistic Effects With Other Risk Factors: Air pollution can interact with other risk factors, such as tobacco smoke or occupational exposures, to increase the overall risk of cancer. For example, exposure to both tobacco smoke and air pollution can have a synergistic effect on lung cancer risk.
""It's important to note that the specific mechanisms and the extent of their contribution to cancer risk may vary depending on the type and concentration of pollutants, individual susceptibility, and other environmental and genetic factors. Reducing exposure to air pollution and adopting measures to improve air quality are crucial steps in reducing the associated cancer risks. Additionally, early detection and intervention remain important in managing and treating cancer,"" says Dr Akshat Malik.

As Diwali celebrations peak, card parties bring a spread of tempting sweets and snacks. The festive allure, coupled with chilly weather, enhances the Diwali charm. However, overindulgence and smog can jeopardize well-being, disrupting the festive spirit. It's crucial to exercise caution in daily activities to safeguard your health and sustain the festive joy.
Post-Diwali, Delhi-NCR's air quality has significantly deteriorated, falling into the 'poor' category on Monday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). This comes after the city was engulfed in a thick layer of smog following the bursting of firecrackers on Diwali night.
1. Long-term Health Impacts
Prolonged exposure to air pollution is a leading cause of respiratory issues, contributing to cardiovascular problems, pulmonary insufficiency, and chronic asthma. Pregnant women are particularly advised to avoid strenuous activity in areas with poor air quality, as prolonged exposure may lead to complications.
2. Environmental Effect
Air pollution is contributing to a global rise in temperatures, resulting in the melting of icebergs and glaciers in polar regions. The annual melting of 1.2 trillion tonnes of ice translates into water that directly flows into our oceans. The long-term consequences of air pollution from fireworks have the potential to exacerbate the climate crisis, posing a serious threat to our environment.
Dr Farah Ingale, Senior consultant Physician & Diabetologist, Fortis Hiranandani Hospital, Vashi, Navi Mumbai shares
Diwali's festive cheer brings with it a tempting array of snacks and sweets, making overeating almost irresistible. Indulging in these treats can lead to digestive issues, including acid reflux and bloating. Outdoor feasting might even bring unwelcome companions like vomiting and food poisoning.
The joyous Diwali celebrations often lead to late-night gatherings, disrupting our natural sleep cycle. Irregular sleep patterns not only affect mood but can also have serious implications for heart and brain health if prolonged.
The hustle and bustle of Diwali preparations involve extensive physical activity, potentially straining the heart. Combined with indulging in fried foods, this can lead to what is known as the ""festive heart syndrome,"" increasing the risk of heart-related complications, including heart attacks.
Moderation is key when it comes to festive drinks, whether alcoholic or not. Consuming beverages on an empty stomach can cause fluctuations in blood sugar and blood pressure levels. For those dealing with diabetes or hypertension, avoiding alcohol is essential. Additionally, social smoking, often prevalent during festive gatherings, can pose significant health risks that should not be ignored.
As Diwali approaches, air pollution becomes a prevalent concern, particularly in the Delhi-NCR region. Those with asthma or other respiratory issues may experience heightened discomfort, sometimes necessitating emergency medical attention. Noise pollution, amplified by loud music and firecrackers, not only affects humans but also takes a toll on animals, emphasizing the need for a balanced and considerate celebration.

New Delhi: Delhi on Sunday recorded the best Air Quality in the past Eight years on Diwali, however, Firecrackers and Low Night Temperatures Pose Pollution RiskOn Diwali evening, the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) in the national capital remained in the ""poor"" category, however compared to previous years, this Diwali the AQI was not touching a grim milestone. Anand Vihar station, a notable hotspot, reported a ""poor"" category with PM 10 at 272 and PM 2.5 at 240. The CO level was at 62, and NO2 stood at 363, both falling under the ""satisfactory"" category according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) at 7 p.m.
Meanwhile, at the Bawana station, PM 10 recorded 127, categorizing it as ""poor,"" while PM 2.5 at 99 was classified as ""moderate."" The CO level was 62, and NO2 was 63, both falling under the ""satisfactory"" category.
Based on data from the Central Pollution Control Board, the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi was 312 on Diwali in 2022, 382 in 2021, 414 in 2020, 337 in 2019, 281 in 2018, 319 in 2017, and 431 in 201 while on Saturday, the 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) marked 220, the lowest recorded on the day preceding Diwali in the past eight years.
The air quality in Delhi exhibited significant improvement just ahead of the festival, attributed to intermittent rain on Friday and favorable wind speeds that facilitated the dispersion of pollutants. In contrast, the 24-hour average AQI on Thursday stood at 437. Over the preceding two weeks, from October 28, the air quality in the city had ranged from 'very poor' to 'severe,' contributing to a dense smog that enveloped the capital during this period.
In the case of the Dwarka Sector-8 station, PM 10 reached 114, placing it in the ""moderate"" category, and PM 2.5 was at 95, categorized as ""satisfactory."" The air quality at the Indira Gandhi International Airport T3 area was in the ""moderate"" category with PM 2.5 at 116 and PM 10 at 99, in the ""satisfactory"" category.
The PM 2.5 at Jahangirpuri was recorded at 130 while PM 10 reached 125, placing both under ""moderate"" category. The carbon monoxide (CO) reached 72, in ""satisfactory"" level and NO2 was at 12, in the ""good"" category.
At Delhi University's North Campus station, the PM 2.5 reached 111, in the ""moderate"" category and PM 10 at 97, in the ""satisfactory"" category while the CO was at 95, in a ""satisfactory"" level.
There is a potential for an increase in pollution levels in Delhi on Sunday night, attributed to lower temperatures and the burning of firecrackers. Data from the 'Decision Support System' indicates that stubble burning in neighboring states, particularly Punjab and Haryana, contributed to 23% of pollution in the national capital on Wednesday. The smoke released from these incidents was a significant factor. On Thursday, the contribution of stubble burning to pollution rose to 33%, while it decreased to 10% on Friday.
The AQI between zero and 50 is considered ""good""; 51 and 100 ""satisfactory""; 101 and 200 ""moderate""; 201 and 300 ""poor""; 301 and 400 ""very poor""; and 401 and 500 ""severe"".

But what is the right air purifier for your home, amidst the wide selection available in the market? An expert shares key tips to keep in mind while shopping for these devices.

Several cities across India have been witnessing growing pollution levels, especially cities in the National Capital Region including Delhi, Noida, Gurgaon and others. Even Mumbai has been witnessing high levels of pollution, as is the case with several other cities in India. And it's not outdoor air that's been affected. Indoor air has become a major source of concern with doctors increasingly suggesting the use of air purifiers. With the market flooded with choices, it's necessary to use one's discretion to buy the right purifier. Ken Armstrong, Air Purification Scientist at Dyson, suggests how to choose the right air purifier to suit your needs.
""Whether we’re sleeping, working, cooking, or exercising, we are potentially breathing dirty air. We can do little to control the quality of the air we breathe outside. But there are ways we can protect our health and wellbeing in our homes. One such way is to invest in an air purifier. The decision to purchase an air purifier could be a positive step towards providing purified air for both you and your family. Purifiers come in various shapes and sizes, remove different kinds of air pollutants in your homes, and offer a wide array of features and specifications,"" says Ken Armstrong. He shares the five important things that one should note before buying an air purifier:
There are different types of filtration and cleaning systems present in purifiers. ""Ultraviolet light, for example, uses electromagnetic radiation to destroy bacteria, viruses and mould but does not remove dust, allergens or particles in the air. Activated carbon filters react chemically with pollutants to clear smoke, odours and gases from the air, but alone do not filter out harmful fine particles. Ionisers work by sending out a stream of charged ions to attract dust and allergens. While fairly popular, it is important to know ionisers can produce ground-level ozone. This raises indoor ozone, which can irritate your lungs,"" says Amstrong. He adds that HEPA H13 standard filters are highly effective at capturing 99.95 per cent of particles as small as 0.1 microns such as allergens, bacteria, H1N1 virus, pollen and mould spores. ""HEPA filters alone, however, will not remove formaldehyde,"" shares Amstrong.
While seemingly fundamental, it is important to be aware of the invisible enemies that we are dealing with in our homes. ""In India, PM2.5 is the most commonly mentioned particle size – which is prevalent in India, almost throughout the year. Particles, unfortunately, do not stop at 2.5 microns. PM0.1 particles, also known as ultra-fine particles, tend to penetrate the fine sacs in our lungs (also known as alveoli) and may even enter our bloodstream easily. Using air purifiers which are fully sealed ensures that no air bypasses the filter and blocks any potential leak points through which dirty air might enter the machines,"" says Amstrong.
To gauge the scale of your needs, measure the approximate length, width and height of your room, and multiply them together to obtain the amount of coverage you require, says Amstrong. He adds, ""Do however bear in mind that the ability to distribute clean air evenly across the room is equally important, as many air purifiers only release air in a singular or upward direction.""
Purifiers can be bulky and heavy, making them difficult to transfer across rooms. ""Light-weight purifiers on the other hand, usually mean that coverage is compromised. There are, however, exceptions to this rule. Certain models of purifiers combine the functionality of a fan with an air purifier, providing the best of both worlds,"" says Armstrong.
For the best results, your air purifier should run continuously. ""If you plan to run your purifier regularly, consider the noise level at the highest and lowest speeds. A volume of less than 30 decibels will allow you to sleep peacefully. If you plan to have an air purifier in your bedroom, consider one that offers a night mode,"" says Amstrong.
Some air purifiers connect to an app from the manufacturer. Amstrong says, ""These apps allow you to control your machine from your smart device. They also provide updates and reports on air quality and alert you when your machine needs maintenance or a filter replacement.""

New Delhi: The Union Health Ministry on Friday updated the advisory for air pollution and directed all the states to implement the same. The ministry has also warned that the rising air pollution may exacerbate the severity of a Covid-19 infection in the patients who are already infected. The ministry also said that the presence of airborne dust particles has the potential to facilitate the transmission of the coronavirus.
As per the government advisory, covering your mouth and nose with a handkerchief or cloth is not sufficient to combat pollution. If the Air Quality Index (AQI) exceeds 200, it is advisable to use N95 or N99 masks, especially for short durations, as prolonged use may cause breathing difficulties for some individuals.
Consider using air purifiers when the air quality is above 200. Refrain from conducting indoor Havan ceremonies. If you use air conditioning in your car or home, set it to recirculate mode to keep indoor air inside. Avoid burning incense sticks and mosquito coils.
Citing data from ICMR, the government reported that in 2019, 18% of deaths in India were attributed to air pollution, resulting in a loss of eleven and a half years of life on average. The government recognizes that prolonged exposure to high pollution levels increases the risk of heart disease, respiratory issues, and diseases such as brain and lung cancer.
The impact of air pollution can be particularly hazardous for specific groups, including children under 5 years old, pregnant women, individuals involved in outdoor occupations like traffic management, and those who are already unwell.

New Delhi: Until yesterday, Delhi NCR's AQI lingered at 400, causing concern. However, recent winds and overnight rain have brought relief, easing the worries of Delhi residents. Unfortunately, neither state governments nor the strong words of the Supreme Court have provided immediate relief from pollution. The rain and wind have finally reduced AQI in Delhi to below 400 after 8 days. Presently, the AQI hovers between 200 to 250, offering a respite.
In Today's DNA, Zee News anchor Sourabh Raaj Jain analysed the effectiveness of Delhi Government's measures to combat air pollution in the national capital. Although AQI is assessed on a 24-hour basis, the smog has dispersed due to the rain. The weather department predicts this favorable condition to persist for the next one or two days.
Given Delhi's pollution crisis, the Supreme Court remains firm. Today's hearing echoed past reprimands as the Court criticized the Delhi government. It questioned the lack of concrete anti-pollution measures over the last 6 years and why actions are reactive, relying on court intervention rather than proactive preparation
The government touted the odd-even formula as an effective pollution reduction strategy, citing a study. Delhi's government listed its benefits in the name of pollution control. However, the Supreme Court had previously deemed it inadequate, urging the Delhi government to explore alternative solutions. It appears the government lacks options beyond odd-even to combat pollution. Although the plan was initially set for post-Diwali implementation, it is currently postponed.
To alleviate pollution in Delhi, the Delhi government had planned for artificial rain, but currently, this initiative is on hold. If pollution escalates post-Diwali, the implementation of artificial rain remains a possibility.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's ambitious scheme for combating pollution during the winter season is about to make a comeback once again. While the Delhi government has expressed a desire to implement the scheme from November 13 for a week, the proposal is on hold as of now after the Supreme Court questioned the move. The Supreme Court questioned the Delhi Government’s decision to impose the odd-even scheme for private vehicles in Delhi tering the odd-even as 'all optics'.
Meanwhile, a survey by the Local Circle has revealed that a majority of Delhites are not in favour of the scheme. The 2023 survey asked Delhi NCR residents whether they support the Odd-Even scheme. ""Out of 10,644 respondents, 36% or around one-third stated 'yes' and 64% stated 'no'. To sum up, 64% of Delhi NCR residents surveyed do not support the introduction of Odd-Even vehicle rule as a solution to air pollution,"" revealed the survey.
The respondents shared their concerns regarding the scheme as well. ""The biggest group of 56% indicated that 'two-wheelers', which account for a large number of vehicles on the road, should not be exempt; 44% opposed exemption to 'women drivers alone or with child up to 12 years of age'; 44% indicated 'vehicles with person/s with physical disabilities'; 33% indicated 'private vehicles with school children in uniform (only during school timings)'; 22% indicated 'electric vehicles' and 22% of respondents indicated 'other exemptions not listed above'. To sum up, 56% of Delhi-NCR residents surveyed are opposed to 1 or more exemptions in Odd-Even vehicle rule implementation,"" said the survey.
First implemented by the Kejriwal-led government in 2016, the odd-even rule, which allows private four-wheelers to be driven only on alternate days according to the last digit of their number plate, had limited impact mainly due to the many exemptions. Odd and Even system for private cars in 2016 for two weeks had led to inconvenience for many, some even buying a new vehicle and many finding car-pool partners to travel to their workplace. While it led to smoother traffic, the impact on pollution was marginal.
The survey received over 21,000 responses from residents of Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram & Faridabad. 63% of respondents were men while 37% of respondents were women.

But toxic air does eyes great harm and essential steps need to be taken to keep eyes healthy and vision perfect.

Growing air pollution in Delhi and surrounding cities like Noida, Gurgaon, Faridabad, and Ghaziabad, have left residents and health experts worried. And it's not just Delhi-NCR, several cities across India have been reeling under the impact of toxic air. Dr Maramganty Vamshidhar, Senior Cataract and Refractive Surgeon, Maxivision Eye Hospital, Somajiguda, Hyderabad, says, ""Air pollution is a pressing global concern with far-reaching health implications. While most of us are aware of its effects on our respiratory system, we often overlook its impact on our eyes."" In this article, the doctor explains the ways in which air pollution affects our eyes, the problems it can cause, warning signs to look out for, and practical steps to follow in order to take care of our precious vision.
Dr Maramganty Vamshidhar lists the following impacts of air pollution on the eyes:
1. Irritation and Dryness: Polluted air is laden with tiny particulate matter, chemicals, and toxins that can irritate the eyes. When these pollutants come into contact with the delicate surface of our eyes, they can cause redness, itching, and a gritty feeling. Prolonged exposure may result in chronic dry eyes.
2. Allergic Reactions: Allergens which are airborne like pollen and mold spores can attach themselves to pollution particles, thereby forming a potent allergenic mix. This can lead to allergic reactions in the eyes, leading to symptoms such as itching, tearing, and swollen eyelids.
3. Increased Risk of Eye Infections: Air pollution weakens the eye's natural defence mechanisms. This makes the eyes more vulnerable to infections, as pollutants can compromise the integrity of the protective tear film and make it easier for bacteria or viruses to enter the eye.
Air pollution can lead to following eye issues, Dr Vamshidhar points out:
1. Conjunctivitis: Also known as ""pink eye,"" conjunctivitis is a common eye condition often caused by viral or bacterial infections. Air pollution can weaken the eye's defences because of exposure to pollutants and can increase one's likelihood of developing conjunctivitis.
2. Dry Eye Syndrome: Prolonged exposure to air pollution can lead to dry eye syndrome, a condition in which the eyes do not produce enough tears or the tears evaporate too quickly. This can result in discomfort, blurred vision, and an increased risk of corneal damage.
3. Cataracts: Yes, you read that right! Air pollution can contribute to the development and progression of cataracts. Prolonged exposure to air pollution has been linked to an increased risk of developing this clouding of the eye's natural lens, leading to impaired vision.
4. Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD): Air pollution's oxidative stress can accelerate the progression of AMD, a leading cause of vision loss among older adults. AMD affects the macula, and the central part of the retina, and impairs central vision.
1. Persistent redness, itching, or burning sensation in the eyes.
2. Frequent tearing or watery eyes.
3. Gritty feeling, as if there's something in your eye.
4. Blurred or fluctuating vision.
5. Sensitivity to light.
6. Eye discharge or crust in the morning.
7. Difficulty in focusing or seeing clearly, especially at night.
While you might not be able to control outdoor pollution, you can take certain steps to keep your eyes healthy. Dr Vamshidhar suggests the following steps:
1. Use Artificial Tears: Lubricating eye drops can help alleviate dryness and discomfort caused by pollution. Use preservative-free artificial tears as needed.
2. Wear Protective Eyewear: Consider wearing wrap-around sunglasses to shield your eyes from pollutants and allergens when outdoors, especially on high-pollution days.
3. Stay Hydrated: Proper hydration helps maintain the tear film's integrity. Drink enough water to prevent dry eyes.
4. Avoid Rubbing Your Eyes: Rubbing can exacerbate irritation and introduce germs into your eyes. If your eyes are irritated, use clean hands or a sterile eyewash to rinse them.
5. Maintain Good Indoor Air Quality: Use air purifiers and keep windows closed during days of high pollution to reduce indoor exposure.
6. Regular Eye Check-ups: Visit an eye care professional for regular check-ups, especially if you experience persistent eye discomfort or vision changes.
Dr Vamshidhar points out the following dos and don'ts:
1. Do wear protective eyewear when necessary.
2. Do wash your hands frequently to prevent introducing germs to your eyes.
3. Do seek professional help if you experience persistent eye issues.
4. Do stay informed about air quality in your area and take precautions on high pollution days.
1. Don't rub your eyes when they are irritated.
2. Don't ignore warning signs of eye problems.
3. Don't smoke, as it can worsen eye conditions and increase the risk of cataracts.
4. Don't use redness-relief eye drops without a doctor's recommendation, as they can mask underlying issues.
""Air pollution is a silent threat to our eyesight, and its effects should not be underestimated. By understanding how pollution impacts our eyes, recognising warning signs, and taking the necessary precautions, we can protect our vision and ensure a healthier future for our eyes. It's essential to stay proactive, take care of our eyes, and advocate for cleaner air to reduce the long-term impact of air pollution on our eye health,"" Dr Vamshidhar signs off.
