Emissions grew by more than 1 per cent during 2023 even as scientists say they need to peak and then decline by 25 per cent to 40 per cent by 2030."

The legal framework governing the transport sector and road safety underwent a major overhaul with the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act in 2019. But all of this good work is undone by the inability to reduce road deaths and crashes, where India continues to top global lists. The coming years will require the government to address the slowdown of projects and missed deadlines. Improving the financial health of its premier highway-building agency, the National Highways Authority of India, will also be a top priority. The agency is burdened by a colossal debt of over Rs 3.4 lakh crore. A large portion of its funds goes into servicing this debt, leaving it with little wriggle room for investments in new projects. The government has several plans to ease this burden in the next few years, one of which is to issue Infrastructure Investment Trusts to take funds from investors and invest in profitable projects. Moreover, the ministry also has ambitious plans to roll out innovative tech. These include implementing GPS-based, contactless toll collection on highways and establishing electric corridors for trucks. These initiatives aim to modernise India’s road infrastructure and improve efficiency, but how well and how soon they can be implemented will be criticial to their success. The Modi government’s third term will be tested on the viability of these promises and if it can translate them into tangible outcomes."

I am obsessed with AQI, or Air Quality Index. This should not be surprising because, for the past five decades, I have lived in probably the most polluted city in the world, certainly with the worst air in India. Yes, the capital city of India—Delhi. On November 28, its air was no longer in the ‘severe’ category. The AQI had dipped from 395 the previous day to 312. The irony is that this 55,000 sq. km urban sprawl breathed a sigh of relief because the air had improved to over three times worse than permissible. It was Delhi’s worst November in eight years, with an average AQI of 377, and 11 days that saw the megacity plunge into the ‘severe’ category above AQI 400. What amazes me is that Delhi is where all the powers that be—the political class, the bureaucrats and the judiciary—reside. They have the power to do something about a problem that stares them in the face daily, but all we see is finger-pointing. Sadly, this is no longer just a Delhi story, hundreds of millions of Indians across the map breathe fiendishly toxic air."

She has invested Rs 1.5 lakh on a system that regulates the air quality inside the house. Indoor plants soak up the rest of the stray pollutants hanging about in the air."

Doctors, too, began reporting an alarming rise in complaints of respiratory disorders. In desperation, the Delhi administration reached out to experts at IIT Kanpur to conduct an experiment that they had long been contemplating—of artificial rain. Using the technique of ‘cloud seeding’, it involves dispersing silver iod­ide into the atmosphere, which aids the formation of ice crystals in clouds and triggers precipitation. Its use is mostly in dispelling drought in an area, but Delhi wanted to try it—for the first time—to clean its air of pollutants. Fortunately, Mother Nature intervened and unexpected showers washed away the smog, restoring some of the air quality. But with its Air Quality Index (AQI), a pollution indicator, continuing to hover at ‘hazardous’ levels, Delhi kept the cloud-seeding aircraft on standby."
