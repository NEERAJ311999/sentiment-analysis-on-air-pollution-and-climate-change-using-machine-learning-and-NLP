# sentiment-analysis-on-air-pollution-and-climate-change-using-machine-learning-and-NLP
This project explores public sentiment on air pollution and climate change by analyzing social media data using machine learning and NLP techniques. The goal is to understand how people perceive and react to environmental issues based on their textual expressions.

To analyse public sentiment regarding air pollution news using machine learning techniques. By examining both news articles and user-generated content from YouTube videos all data is taken from INDIA news website and YouTube video with respect to INDIA, the research seeks to understand how air pollution is framed in the media and how audiences react to it. The primary objectives include: 

Sentiment Clustering: Implementing unsupervised learning techniques to categorize sentiment (Positive, Negative, and Neutral) in textual data from news articles and YouTube comments. 

Sentiment Classification: Applying supervised machine learning models to enhance sentiment prediction accuracy. 

Public Perception Analysis: Gaining insights into public discourse on air pollution 

This study focuses on analysing textual data related to air pollution, collected from news articles and YouTube comments. Air pollution is a critical environmental and public health concern, influenced by factors such as industrial emissions, vehicular pollution, meteorological conditions, and government policies. YouTube serves as a significant platform for news dissemination and public discourse, offering diverse opinions, reactions, and debates on air pollution topics. 

To achieve a comprehensive understanding of public sentiment, the study adopts a two-phase machine learning approach firstly Unsupervised Learning for Sentiment Clustering then Supervised Learning for Sentiment Classification Machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks, XGBoost, and AdaBoost. 

By integrating sentiment analysis from both news reports and user discussions, this study provides valuable insights into public perceptions of air pollution. These insights can aid in refining communication strategies, strengthening environmental policies, and developing more effective responses to air pollution challenges.
