Air pollution is a SERIOUS health hazard and it&#39;s high time we acknowledge that. If we keep on focusing on the positives when will we extinguishe the negatives."
21,2024-06-16T13:36:07Z,"The problem still exists though, ppl in delhi have their lifespan cut off by 17 years cuz of air pollution. So, I think it&#39;s high time we focus on the negative factors more and correct them as soon as possible."

95,2023-03-11T06:48:43Z,I am sorry karl i appreciate your good intent. But people or narrative in general don&#39;t really care about positives as long as there is this one sticking negative prickly character about particular thing which is so overwhelming that it becomes identity.

205,2023-02-03T10:19:56Z,Delhi is a part of India! It doesn&#39;t even represent 90% of the South India and may be 50% of the north!!
206,2023-02-03T05:36:50Z,"Omg.  No one cares, its india"
207,2023-02-03T04:45:02Z,"Bruh, i SMELLED india when i flew over it. You aint changing any minds"
208,2023-02-03T03:31:19Z,"Stfu, it&#39;s still polluted way beyond acceptable levels throughout the year"

210,2023-02-02T20:57:41Z,Thank you bro
211,2023-02-02T20:31:39Z,All of those pictures had pretty limited visibility.
212,2023-02-02T20:02:18Z,"Yeah but do they still shit in the streets? Just looked it up 48%, over 500 million people craping in public. If it&#39;s the rainy season bring stilts."
213,2023-02-02T19:56:20Z,That sounds an awful lot like tourism propaganda
214,2023-02-02T19:32:46Z,Yeah dude but I doubt ordinary people who have to earn for the living can afford not to live in those polluted big cities
215,2023-02-02T16:40:56Z,But I guarantee you if you come to Delhi. You could see air pollution everywhere
216,2023-02-02T14:50:32Z,Shouldn&#39;t happen AT ALL
217,2023-02-02T13:45:40Z,Ah my hometown
218,2023-02-02T13:06:25Z,India is diverse and beutiful but due to growing pollution it&#39;s losing its beautybut our responsibility to make it much more beautiful  Jay hind
219,2023-02-02T12:52:16Z,It doesn&#39;t justify the pollution. Like having that much pollution for even a season or few months is incredibly detrimental.
220,2023-02-02T12:34:03Z,National medias almost forgot Kerala and tamilnadu
221,2023-02-02T11:45:09Z,Farms are one of the causes of the smog
222,2023-02-02T10:01:14Z,India has 2 hell Delhi MumbaiI&#39;m from chhattisgarh bowl of

227,2023-02-02T06:23:04Z,Come to north east india
228,2023-02-02T05:50:16Z,Not because of factories
229,2023-02-02T05:09:27Z,India looks like that all year
230,2023-02-02T03:28:56Z,Now do the Ganges. How many months is it clean?Then do Mumbai train commutes.How many days is it not hell?
231,2023-02-02T01:49:50Z,You know it better because just like media at one point you were uncovering &quot;SCAM&quot; to get YouTube money. I am curious why you&#39;re pandering to India now?! Perhaps your old ninja techniques failed on your face.BTW why don&#39;t you show how bad Black Power or Nomads are in NZ when you&#39;re there?
232,2023-02-01T21:11:25Z,"There is a misconception that India is pretty. Ok, outside of the major cities of course, that is few when only most of the water, even filtered, is awful and polluted. But the big or bigger cities, shit holes. IF you don&#39;t like it, do something about it. Because most of India and the way the government and the crooked companies treat those people, just awful."
233,2023-02-01T18:44:38Z,Brand ambassador of India! Best Indian guide for any tourist.
234,2023-02-01T18:21:49Z,"It&#39;s not a misconception. It&#39;s reality. The fact is that India is just extremely polluted and dirty. Speaking to news agencies cherry picking clips, it seems the same has been done here. There are clean parts of the country but that is because very few people are there. Any city in India with a significant to modest population is polluted incarnate."
235,2023-02-01T18:15:26Z,After so long I have seen him praising India    well done GOI for making this happen
236,2023-02-01T17:43:29Z,Thank you for sharing this I did not know

240,2023-02-01T15:42:28Z,"only 2 days of such fugging smog is extremly evil, btw in new delhi is mt everest of garbage, no toilets in india, in reality river ghanges is full of shidd, urin, ash of deads and industrial wastewater and indians bathing inside and drinking that water, right ???????"
241,2023-02-01T15:25:37Z,"Media really makes it seem like India is one huge trash pile of pollution. It&#39;s a really beautiful country, I&#39;d love to visit someday."
242,2023-02-01T15:06:03Z,I had been in Delhi for 5 years around 2008. It was nice weather and no mist all year round
243,2023-02-01T14:28:08Z,"It causes due to people makes born , farm  and removing hills to plain simultaneously"
244,2023-02-01T13:16:35Z,Your content is fabulous so unbiased and absolutely from the heart about India! So glad you&#39;re not leaning towards white supremacy! Looks like you&#39;re almost becoming one of us! An indian
245,2023-02-01T12:46:19Z,News channels show the news  that sell
246,2023-02-01T12:40:39Z,the news just suuuks up to the west.
247,2023-02-01T12:11:34Z,"It looks nice from the sky but come on the street, you&#39;ll just throw up"
248,2023-02-01T12:06:54Z,If there are such stupid people to make such misconceptions then please stay away. We’re eventually becoming less welcoming to stupidity and hostility
249,2023-02-01T11:43:33Z,"No! Media does show these beautiful sites and what the 1% get to enjoy. What it doesn&#39;t show you is the sufferings, hunger, poverty, oppression, hatred, and the list goes on."
250,2023-02-01T11:20:16Z,"The AQI is still terrible in and near urban areas no matter the fluctuations in air clarity. You will still notice that even in rural areas, once clearly visible hills/ mountains are obscured by a haze."
251,2023-02-01T10:28:54Z,Now he start making negetive videos on India
252,2023-02-01T09:49:46Z,"Crop burning is the main factor, if India installs effective waste management systems and makes crop burning illegal, it could make a MASSIVE difference."
253,2023-02-01T09:27:40Z,Because it doesn’t fit with western media’s propaganda against india
254,2023-02-01T09:11:00Z,Thank you for bringing out the true colours of our country
255,2023-02-01T09:00:37Z,South India and the northeast in India is mesmerizing

277,2023-01-31T17:32:34Z,"Please let them know that North India Is not fully polluted we have pollution free places like Mizoram, Aizawl, Guwahati, etc we also take cleaning seriously around here"
278,2023-01-31T15:15:23Z,"Beijing, Singapore fixes the haze. It&#39;s not an excuse for New Delhi for not doing anything"
279,2023-01-31T15:09:57Z,"Ahh, so most of the year it only looks HALF as polluted, got it!"

299,2023-01-31T06:46:26Z,In future you are going to become brand ambassador of India.
300,2023-01-31T05:55:08Z,Another paid video
301,2023-01-31T05:49:26Z,yup it will always be like that

306,2023-01-31T01:58:20Z,I think you are doing such an important job here… You’re right everybody’s wrong
307,2023-01-31T01:50:18Z,"Awesome, thanks buddy! I am really fed up of all the misinformation about India on the western media channels."
308,2023-01-31T00:11:25Z,The fact that it looks like that at all is jacked up so.. yeah I don’t know what the goal here is because it actually is as bad as they say in larger areas. Doesn’t mean the people are bad or not great humans it just means the pollution is very high.
309,2023-01-30T21:37:42Z,"Yep, didn’t even realize India had that much pollution"
310,2023-01-30T21:20:11Z,Can you show us designated shitting streets
311,2023-01-30T21:19:18Z,Thank you for sharing.
312,2023-01-30T20:28:18Z,It&#39;s not making the situation better you know?
313,2023-01-30T20:07:05Z,The news doesn’t need to report a country hitting the bare minimum…
314,2023-01-30T19:54:24Z,People of the northern state of Punjab could see the Himalayas for the first time IN DECADES as the Covid lockdown eased air pollution… in the North the pollution is terrible… all year round… already for decades… and that is what the News shows… and they are correct….
315,2023-01-30T19:21:51Z,Can you help to see if theirs any misconceptions about street vendors? All the videos I see look so they don’t care about sanitation
316,2023-01-30T19:21:40Z,Still looks like an absolute dump plus the people are nothing but scammers truly a bad country
317,2023-01-30T18:43:20Z,Check the south and eastern parts of india
318,2023-01-30T18:36:14Z,well that&#39;s comforting
319,2023-01-30T16:36:05Z,still horrifyingly disgusting
320,2023-01-30T16:16:57Z,"The that media doesnt just show  random farmland in India because that just aint very interesting to look at. Obviously farmland isnt gonna be completely polluted with things emitted by a city. “And here we have Indian farmland, fun fact there are crops grown here. Its also rumoured that there are Indians living here but that has not yet been confirmed”"
321,2023-01-30T16:08:25Z,"Just tell your cousins to please stop the bloody &quot;potential spam&quot; calls at dinner time,it&#39;s infuriates my wifey."
322,2023-01-30T16:04:31Z,I would go to Kashmir
323,2023-01-30T16:00:04Z,"And even you didn&#39;t show the South or the North Eastern India, did you? Coz... that doesn&#39;t fit with the global perception of the Indo-Aryan identity of the denizens? You are still perpetuating the Hindi-centric notions of India and playing into the cultural hegemony that started with the decline of Harappan Civilization."
324,2023-01-30T15:17:42Z,Media doesn&#39;t need to show what it looks like all year round.It should show what it really think of India.
325,2023-01-30T14:36:06Z,This is same like every other countries...
326,2023-01-30T13:01:35Z,We are really thankful that you understand India like this love from India
327,2023-01-30T12:53:59Z,"I thought India was made up of 80% Concrete buildings with kind, Anti-Virus, Microsoft employees who would love to help you fix your computer."
328,2023-01-30T12:47:43Z,Media and news coming together and agreeing to stereotype India and mexico &quot;having&quot; horrible weather and sky colors:
329,2023-01-30T12:19:47Z,North india??
330,2023-01-30T12:10:08Z,"Look if you don&#39;t Acknowledge a problem then that problem won&#39;t solve be it air pollution, garbage mountain in Delhi which is contaminating the ground water, radiation tower, unrepaired traffic signals leading to traffic jams, bad quality roads....these are serious problems.....Mera Bharat Mahaan sirf bolna nahi hai....banana bhi hai Jai Hind"
331,2023-01-30T12:06:07Z,hello India OLX name I tell you it is not a India exit Tamil Nadu
332,2023-01-30T11:58:19Z,Indians are leaving India for less polluted and less crowded countries.
333,2023-01-30T11:58:07Z,"To be honest though, even during the “good” months, the air inside the cities is still waaay too toxic"
334,2023-01-30T11:46:16Z,"hey carl , when will you explore odisha? the temple city of india"
335,2023-01-30T11:17:54Z,Finally a white man has blessed us with his approval
336,2023-01-30T11:16:10Z,"I guess, it&#39;s the movie Tenet, where there was a scene from Mumbai. and believe me, Hollywood used the worst filter or camera, whatever it was, to film a building in Mumbai. I bet it wasn&#39;t that ugly in reality as that filter made it look like. Not saying Mumbai is this or that, but wasn&#39;t even that movie tried making it look like. Even if you want to show slums, show it, but with the same camera quality and filter that you will show US or London perhaps"
337,2023-01-30T10:21:18Z,Show us the shit covered streets
338,2023-01-30T08:40:05Z,News channels always target the negativity because that&#39;s what people want to see.. especially disasters from other countries are loved very much. It&#39;s the same for every country&#39;s news channel
339,2023-01-30T08:21:22Z,"Only Punjab and Haryana is responsible for this pollution, not all northern states."
340,2023-01-30T08:15:18Z,There are many natural and cultural places to visit in India but I have seen many tourists just visit the city area like Delhi and Mumbai
341,2023-01-30T08:09:19Z,Whole india under dust meanwhile Kashmir is heaven as far as beauty is considered
342,2023-01-30T07:40:14Z,Thank you
343,2023-01-30T07:37:33Z,Thanks for mentioning cg i was waiting for it
344,2023-01-30T07:21:57Z,"I like most of your videos, man. You&#39;re a good person at heart. Thanks for making this reel, too."
345,2023-01-30T07:13:35Z,because you dont report on the normal... you report on whats not normal and what disrupts the good things.
346,2023-01-30T06:57:51Z,"Just go to your local landfill if you want to experience India; the people care nothing for the land, trash everywhere.  Most of the country is a polluted mess."
347,2023-01-30T06:49:41Z,"Same here in the Philippines. Metro Manila always have those smogs and air pollution. But outside of the big cities, it always look clear.  Like where I live."
348,2023-01-30T06:44:09Z,Northeast laughing at corner
349,2023-01-30T06:33:02Z,The fact that it looks like that any of the year is a major problem my guy.
350,2023-01-30T06:02:32Z,Thanks for showing chhattisgarh
351,2023-01-30T05:53:41Z,People don&#39;t understand how beautiful India is
352,2023-01-30T05:29:32Z,"There is another mis consumption, Hindi is not the national language."
353,2023-01-30T05:05:07Z,Please correct your caption . Call it delhi not India .
354,2023-01-30T04:00:00Z,Yeah right…
355,2023-01-30T03:57:44Z,like you not able to hide to portrait negative Pakistan
356,2023-01-30T03:40:24Z,"Maybe the media doesn&#39;t get an idea of what the rural areas are like because, as I understand, there has been little effort to market the natural environments, National Parks and other visitor friendly Nature Preserves."
357,2023-01-30T03:38:15Z,There&#39;s still a lot of pollution visable in the second image of Delhi. It&#39;s still really bad…
358,2023-01-30T03:27:24Z,One country I’d never visit lol where I’m living I already feel like I’m in the middle of Mumbai
359,2023-01-30T03:25:38Z,"Oh good, the death air is only around half the time, I will reconsider my visit"
360,2023-01-30T02:33:40Z,"True, but oh in the last decade has seen an increase in dust and garbage in kullu / manali. It is no longer clean nor is it beautiful. It&#39;s polluted, the rivers are dammed, the mountain sides are strewn with garbage and the pestilential apple orchards are toxic with chemicals. The buildings are random and built with no thought to aesthetics or safety ..it is ugly now year round.."
361,2023-01-30T02:25:38Z,Still looks like a lot of haze in those &quot;good&quot; pics.
362,2023-01-30T01:52:10Z,You all blame north india for air pollution but you all don&#39;t see that garbage mountain in delhi.
363,2023-01-30T01:22:28Z,Also in Chiang Mai Thailand there&#39;s the smoke season where farmers burns fields after harvesting
364,2023-01-30T00:40:00Z,Ok what about the smell then?
365,2023-01-30T00:28:55Z,"Don&#39;t travel to Delhi, the air pollution is basically as high as it can get. Instead travel to other cities like Bangalore(where I live) or Chennai . People think India is not developed but get this, in Bangalore there are skyscrapers and malls almost everywhere.  Some people think there is a lot of criminal activity here but I promise it is safe to visit."
366,2023-01-30T00:15:33Z,This heroin Looking addict is a BJP supporter who’s father in law supports the RSS. In fact Karl Rocks wife denies the atrocities against Sikhs in 1984 and denies the gujurat Riots ever happened.  Despite video and empirical evidence Karl bud into it this propaganda. The support Modis genocidal policies.  Why do you think he’s didn’t do much time out side of India?  It’s political spin.  His father in law was instrumental in organizing mine and providing wrestling during the 1984 genocide of Sikhs and stole land from his neighbors who were killed or injured.  All in an effort for him to win a political position
367,2023-01-30T00:08:46Z,"lol, I always thought it was sand storms!!"
368,2023-01-30T00:08:10Z,That&#39;s because mexico looks like this:
369,2023-01-29T23:30:55Z,"Just avoid going there Nov to Feb. I just got back, severely sick. COPD is an acronym every household knows very well in India. And also, I wasn’t even in North North. I was mostly in West Bengal and Maharashtra. One misinformation doesn’t destroy the other misinformation. I am Indian and just stating the facts."
370,2023-01-29T23:15:01Z,I love how the scale only went from unhealthy to hazardous
371,2023-01-29T23:04:13Z,It should never look like that
372,2023-01-29T21:50:29Z,Same goes go neighbouring country bangladesh
373,2023-01-29T21:19:49Z,Accept the facts.... India is the most polluted country! Let do something about it rather than denied the issue!
374,2023-01-29T20:12:27Z,why would the news show us that side when you are top 3 polluters in the world? by a landslide.
375,2023-01-29T20:10:42Z,"Karl, I appreciate your effort but please do not encourage people to pollute the environment. 1.6 million people died in 2019 in India due to this deadly air pollution. And also Delhi’s hazardous AQI is not limited to few weeks. It is unhealthy almost entire year. Please do not create such misleading content in the name of positivity."
376,2023-01-29T19:52:44Z,There’s no water in africa
377,2023-01-29T19:29:24Z,Well it looks horrible both ways
378,2023-01-29T19:21:19Z,"Come to North-East India, there, we can see blue sky."
379,2023-01-29T19:08:11Z,"Yes, the news does show me that side. More often than not when it suffers from extreme air pollution the news uses shots from other times in the year to show how bad it is."
380,2023-01-29T19:05:42Z,No don&#39;t kill them by showing truth. They will die out of frustration for the fact that they looted India soo much and still it becomes unbeatable.
381,2023-01-29T19:02:05Z,"Yeah no thanks, I’ll pass"
382,2023-01-29T18:47:10Z,"As an Indian, I don&#39;t throw the waste here and there on the streets, or in any other place. When I&#39;m outside, I keep them in my bag or in my pocket and whenever I see dustbins, I put them in the dustbins.Can you guys also do the same?"
383,2023-01-29T18:27:46Z,"There is even another misconception that india is restricted to only few state and places like New Delhi and Bombay or Goa, Bangalore etc. There are states where you find river, sea, himalayas, hills, and plains in the same state.. And even more picturesque.. So travel to east of india also.."
384,2023-01-29T17:36:04Z,THANK YOU! Same with Karachi. A burger woman was doing this mini docu about the pollution in Karachi and she exaggerated it SO much and pinning comments of people saying their eyes burned whenever they sat by a window in Karachi
385,2023-01-29T17:35:44Z,"Aah brother ,my hometown uttrakhand"
386,2023-01-29T17:07:49Z,Finally india is growing greater jai hind
387,2023-01-29T17:04:12Z,The news not sweeping the revolting environmental regulations under the rug is a good thing. You should see what the pollution does.
388,2023-01-29T16:55:56Z,It is because of Fake western propaganda
389,2023-01-29T16:53:19Z,Bruh I live in India
390,2023-01-29T16:40:15Z,"Even the &quot;clean&quot; pictures you posted still look like the air quality is pretty awful, tbh."
391,2023-01-29T16:28:35Z,Instead of relying on youtubers and heresy just google the aqi of the city you live in or want to visit; anything above 50 is bad.
392,2023-01-29T16:11:03Z,"Good News, the air quality of India is ONLY fatal a couple of months each year"
393,2023-01-29T15:51:43Z,how about the fact that anyone who goes there better take some extra toilet paper
394,2023-01-29T15:50:39Z,Can you talk about food hygiene in India?
395,2023-01-29T15:44:45Z,No clean air in outskirts of delhi all year around . And that is a truth
396,2023-01-29T15:38:37Z,He is more Indian than indians
397,2023-01-29T15:33:04Z,Its a misconception until you see the graphs lol lol lol
398,2023-01-29T15:29:49Z,Same goes for Bangladesh bro
399,2023-01-29T14:48:27Z,"No, because the news doesn&#39;t show the normal"
400,2023-01-29T14:45:44Z,Its not just airpollution. India is year in year out chosen as the filthiest nation on the planet by WHO oit of 196 nations aside of extremely overpolluted rivers that are 28.000 times more pollited than the international accepted levels and so on. This video of smog is only a tiny cherrypicked problem of the anount of filth and lack of hygiene when you look at a whole and in every regard alltogether
401,2023-01-29T14:22:19Z,"No anyone can describe india in pictures. because weather, living style, terrain, food, clothes, language and many more changes according State or area.I don&#39;t visit any foreign countries but I sure, no other country has kind of Beauty as Bharat (India) have."
402,2023-01-29T14:13:51Z,Yeah it is a very big miconception
403,2023-01-29T13:56:58Z,"As a resident of India for the past 30 years, I can say though that the pollution is so much worse than it was 30 years ago when I arrived. This is all year around. We really need to pull together India, we are killing people with smoke. Those leaves that we burn can be composted. Just that one little change can make a vast difference."
404,2023-01-29T13:50:57Z,Karl what&#39;s your country? I wanna roast abt it
405,2023-01-29T12:52:58Z,"Just visit north east and south indian parts ,"
406,2023-01-29T12:52:43Z,"Just visit north east and south indian parts ,"
407,2023-01-29T12:28:47Z,"m from chhattisgarh.. n when it comes to chhattisgarh the media only shows naxalite attacks which have happened in the past. n people believe chhattisgarh is a  naxalite area. many even don&#39;t know the capital of the state n most of the people on hearing chhattisgarh believe its in jharkhand... chhattisgarh has lot of greenery, it separated from madhya pradesh unlike jharkhand which formed out of bihar and raipur is the capital city......"
408,2023-01-29T12:18:50Z,India is really beautiful but the media doesn&#39;t show. It&#39;s the same with Afghanistan.
409,2023-01-29T12:07:19Z,Dont go to India especially the Hindus! They  are terrorists  and killing Muslims. And they will always scamm you
410,2023-01-29T12:04:11Z,Don&#39;t worry about India. Think about yourself where Corona is thriving .Ask why    ?
411,2023-01-29T11:48:50Z,He acts like he knows everything about India when he’s not even Indian but has made a whole career out of exploiting Indians for videos
412,2023-01-29T11:42:17Z,Thanks Karl for appreciating India that is what our some of the indians need to learn from you
413,2023-01-29T11:28:08Z,Respect to you for this
414,2023-01-29T11:27:23Z,"Look if it weren’t for the advancement in media technology neither the Big Media nor some YouTube like yourself could have ever filmed the footage that’s been made available to the rest of us, so what really matters here is  what perception do you want to sell? America, since inception, projects boldness because it is innately insecure. To keep Americans content with their surroundings and prevent brain drain, they have historically gone to lengths to curtail outside media entering their nation, suppressing freedom of expression that is not in line with their government’s medieval mindset and above all, portray a sense of hopelessness in the world that there’s no other place outside the US you’d wanna go! This seeps into their education system where they never talk about the fuck ups they’ve done within the country and outside, they never seem to want to talk about American territories and how they came about to be under the American banner in the first place and they never seem to talk about who their Allies are and why did they join hands with a particular nation? Reasons are important in life but when you’re systematically brainwashing people to NEVER ask questions or not knowing what questions to ask, then you’ve an America on your hands."
415,2023-01-29T11:24:57Z,"I appreciate this person, we need you"
416,2023-01-29T11:21:00Z,And if you go to kerela a state of india that is in south you will experience you are not in india that&#39;s a Paradise
417,2023-01-29T09:31:18Z,Come to Northeast you will never find a Hazardous fog
418,2023-01-29T08:10:53Z,If farmers in Punjab and Haryana are not burning agriculture waste and  if people are not using crackers in festival season northern India would not have such air pollution.
419,2023-01-29T08:06:30Z,stop  burning  farm  waste
420,2023-01-29T07:54:20Z,Ur contry most bed
421,2023-01-29T07:36:39Z,That means you are telling people&#39;s that we should burn more fuels and all the garbage which should raise more recognisable pollution because the damage is yet not done to die easily . Ok  people will burn more because pollution is less they are ignorant most of them thanks for giving them more shitty suggestions.
422,2023-01-29T06:36:44Z,It&#39;s not just north India Karl. I live near Mumbai and also experience this. Majority of this is due to construction and ground/roadside dust. So I assume it would be similar is most medium sized or large cities. During winter the winds don&#39;t blow them away and clear the air as they tend to in summer/rainy season.
423,2023-01-29T06:08:41Z,Good job brother
424,2023-01-29T05:51:32Z,Show the view of Himachal
425,2023-01-29T05:27:46Z,Habibi ..come to North East
426,2023-01-29T03:52:50Z,Winter months have the worst pollution levels. As a Delhi University student I had to wear mask all day. Delhi is a nice place. I miss it.
427,2023-01-29T03:11:55Z,Wow. It looks beautiful. Media always showing the worst.
428,2023-01-29T02:54:39Z,"“Actually looks like this”  that still looks pretty not good my guy. My city “looks” better than all of those, but our pollution levels are still pretty not good. I can only imagine that those better parts of India experience the same or worse considering the later examples are used as good examples"
429,2023-01-29T02:46:38Z,That mean it&#39;s fuckin true then
430,2023-01-29T01:33:01Z,Is it still relatively safe to be in those areas or do the people have to wear masks and such?
431,2023-01-29T01:11:56Z,lol I’m not even a big climate change guy but it’s still wildly polluted
432,2023-01-29T00:00:33Z,"So we&#39;re just glancing over the fact that the pollution fog is actually real, and you&#39;re not explaining those &quot;Circumstances&quot; that black out the sky and cause cancer for 3-5 months of the year?"
433,2023-01-28T23:20:15Z,The render distance is turned up most of the time
434,2023-01-28T22:02:12Z,"Karl, is your Visa Ban lifted now?"
435,2023-01-28T21:42:13Z,Ok but a few months like that is still really too much. When I visited it was sort of ok though
436,2023-01-28T21:30:52Z,It&#39;s still smoggy.
437,2023-01-28T21:04:54Z,"Being Indian, I saw more india thru a NL guy named Karl. Love u brother, keep our beti happy"
438,2023-01-28T20:42:18Z,"God it looks like a shit hole, the brits should never have left"
439,2023-01-28T20:38:47Z,I just don’t understand why western film maker put yellowish filter over any Indian scenes in their films. For example Extraction.India is way more beautiful than many of the European countries and I know  ‘cause I have travelled all across the europe.
440,2023-01-28T20:14:13Z,"If India is such a great country, then why are people leaving it?"
441,2023-01-28T19:57:03Z,Thanks for adding Chhattisgarh
442,2023-01-28T19:50:07Z,"Where do most of the people live? In the mega cities, where is the pollution? In the mega cities, and guess what, they live in the mega cities in those few months when the air pollution is hazardous."
443,2023-01-28T19:37:13Z,"Hollywood movies will show India as brown and muddy with busy markets and dark, sweaty people."
444,2023-01-28T19:08:39Z,Exactly
445,2023-01-28T18:46:47Z,Now I can sleep easy knowing that I will get lung cancer only a certain part of the year
446,2023-01-28T18:33:25Z,"And you still got banned, huh ?"
447,2023-01-28T18:26:47Z,"Honestly I wasn’t really aware of air pollution in India,and I ve been there.But seriously there is trash all over the place ,very sad considering India precious history.The trash is not a misconception."
448,2023-01-28T18:22:23Z,good marketing but india is dirty and polluted AF
449,2023-01-28T18:21:55Z,I would never travel to India foh
450,2023-01-28T18:21:34Z,Thanks brother for covering the good part of India
451,2023-01-28T17:57:37Z,In North India Uttrakhand has got almost none Pollution. Just like Himachal and J&amp;K.

464,2023-01-28T14:43:10Z,Man thanks for pointing out . But you know I too have a very rough statement for those people who say my country is dirty. &quot;At least my cities don&#39;t smell like humid  gutters&quot;  or At least I don&#39;t have to drink what I smell.Orr &quot; says someone whose entire family has more lead in body than trash cans in my street.&quot;
465,2023-01-28T14:39:41Z,"i when to india about 7 years ago,and when i when for a morning coffee i was totally shocked at the amount of people squatting and defecating in the streets at 7am with children an cars passing like it was a common thing to do"

479,2023-01-28T07:34:13Z,That little time of year is more dangerous than any other time of the year.
480,2023-01-28T07:16:57Z,"The lowest average during the year for Delhi is still 150 which is WAY TOO HIGH. It might not be an India-wide problem, but the public should still be outraged about it."
481,2023-01-28T07:08:05Z,not the news its just Hollywoods fakeness
482,2023-01-28T06:42:08Z,"“Stop looking at the hazardous effects of climate change &amp; global warming, the media is full of negativity”  just look at these beautiful pictures and chant “all is well” Fools are actually responsible for all the sufferings of mankind"
483,2023-01-28T06:37:51Z,T’es médias Dow anything for News. Countries outside of the western friends are always shown as extremely weird or poor or evil
484,2023-01-28T06:28:14Z,"India still has outbreaks of plague and widespread leprosy, doesn&#39;t it?"
485,2023-01-28T06:03:15Z,Propaganda to look India better. Stop
486,2023-01-28T05:57:00Z,Even in pune also... Sometimes city seems to be polluted... But when we go to my native which is 70 kms towards baramati from pune or towards lonavla... Sky becomes more blue
487,2023-01-28T05:36:32Z,"Don&#39;t you realise that however, limited temporally, the pictures you show are completely unacceptable at any time in any circumstances?  Why oh why is man intent on destroying God&#39;s bounty and fellow humans?  Just because they believe the widow&#39;s they have created, will be impressed by their supercars and yachts?"
488,2023-01-28T04:49:51Z,I live in Raipur which is capital of chattisgarh and i agree that look
489,2023-01-28T04:22:58Z,All around the world take any metro city especially capital which one is pollution free.conctrete jungle high CO2 is everywhere.
490,2023-01-28T04:22:47Z,"Mate, do you know what the purpose of the news is?The news doesn&#39;t just say oh look at this, everything is fine because they shouldn&#39;t"
491,2023-01-28T03:22:29Z,India ain’t all that mate
492,2023-01-28T02:09:13Z,Still hellish
493,2023-01-28T02:06:58Z,ONLY WINTER BUT REST OF THE YEAR IS BEAUTIFUL
494,2023-01-28T01:50:35Z,I was unlucky to visit Delhi in its worst weather. People were vomiting due to air pollution in the Streets. But local people told me it gets better over time.
495,2023-01-28T01:34:23Z,"Thank you for talking good about my country I once got a reply saying what category for India? The most polluted, and I was very upset because they were mistaken with India when it was Bangladesh and I love my country so I was very upset about that and when I saw your video on this this made me smile because I finally found someone who talked good about my country! Thank you so much"
496,2023-01-28T01:29:31Z,and %100 of Indians now work in scam call centers.
497,2023-01-28T01:24:42Z,It doesn&#39;t always look like this! It just only looks like this in certain places and sometimes in these others
498,2023-01-28T01:23:37Z,Wait i thought mexico and indian looked orange
499,2023-01-28T00:48:35Z,"And the news also doesn&#39;t show the shit condition the bodies in the shit water the people drinking that shit the amount of covid since they handle everything with their hands, that the fucking goonies my dude, every goonie looks beautiful in its own way, if for some months your city looks like fucking silent hill it&#39;s cuz that place shit, there must be like 5 countries at max that do that shit"
500,2023-01-27T23:53:25Z,Not saying its all bad but the clip where it &quot;usually looks like this&quot; still looks smoggy asf.
501,2023-01-27T22:56:31Z,Same with Pakistan
502,2023-01-27T22:39:22Z,"I mean, have you seen Western USA this past few summers? The sky is just as dark, you can stare at the outline of the sun through the smoke."
503,2023-01-27T21:57:42Z,It still looks pretty hazy.
504,2023-01-27T21:56:11Z,I mean its still hazy in all the pictures…
505,2023-01-27T21:45:30Z,So for 1/3 of the year it’s as polluted as China. Awesome.
506,2023-01-27T20:59:06Z,Still a lot of smog outside the city so what’s your point?
507,2023-01-27T20:51:18Z,Stop trying to make excuses for polution
508,2023-01-27T20:29:09Z,Most tourists that go to India they&#39;re probably going to one of the major cities like Mumbai or Delhi or that city the Taj Mahal is in. Even if it&#39;s not like that year round it&#39;s still very polluted in general.
509,2023-01-27T20:07:40Z,Good now that you have started showing some good things about india.. Otherwise you were all about scams
510,2023-01-27T19:29:08Z,it makes me so happy to see foreigners talking the positive sides about us
511,2023-01-27T19:12:00Z,It is still really bad lol even when you are showing footage of the best it has ever been from Covid
512,2023-01-27T19:03:37Z,we need more people
513,2023-01-27T18:22:01Z,That hazardous air pollution those few months is enough to cause deadly breathing problems.
514,2023-01-27T18:17:29Z,India is just heaven now....... We have just got kashmir as our integral part..... Now it&#39;s just pure magic to ........
515,2023-01-27T18:16:44Z,"The same is true about all countries, some things pull more attention than others, if we look at news everyday, USA seems more like a poor country with mindless woke people everywhere and with shoplifting, drug addicts on streets, shootings in schools and totally broken society with no morals !!"
516,2023-01-27T18:06:48Z,Come to North East India
517,2023-01-27T18:01:22Z,This is delusional. Every picture was filled with heavy pollution. Wtf? The guy is out of it
518,2023-01-27T17:50:11Z,this man will do say anything to gain views
519,2023-01-27T17:46:08Z,no its just that the most news is in these polluted parts
520,2023-01-27T17:29:56Z,Nice video... I trust that Indian authorities are taking measures to reduce air pollution
521,2023-01-27T17:07:40Z,"Why would the news show you the exception to the rule? Stop burning the part of your crops you consider waste to get money faster and maybe people can breathe fresh air. Also, the before and after photos still look horrible. Just because you show me one atomic bomb in the sky instead of two, doesn’t make it any better!"
522,2023-01-27T16:47:27Z,Bro chhattisgarh is beautiful af

527,2023-01-27T16:02:53Z,Actually as an indian i see those things rarely i mean the things you mean &quot;actual india&quot;

530,2023-01-27T15:34:04Z,"As an Indian citizen, you gained my respect for purifying Indian image in the world."
531,2023-01-27T15:31:13Z,Oh yeah I love living in an area that just has Fallout 4 conditions for several months lmao

534,2023-01-27T14:58:22Z,india only care about religion not pollution
535,2023-01-27T13:48:20Z,"True. When the news is talking about pollution, it only shows pollution."
536,2023-01-27T13:43:00Z,You&#39;re never gonna convince me India is not the nastiest country in the world
537,2023-01-27T13:32:27Z,This is the reason I laught at Statistics
538,2023-01-27T13:28:21Z,"U know what people don’t realize, this isn’t really fixing any misconceptions because most of the people watching this are Indians"
539,2023-01-27T13:26:24Z,Still it&#39;s looks ugly though. Japan korea china vietnam Indonesia are by far beautiful asian countries
540,2023-01-27T12:59:26Z,That&#39;s because they moved to Australia to pollute it here instead of their own country
541,2023-01-27T12:42:24Z,Thank you for telling truth
542,2023-01-27T12:26:07Z,It seems like you haven&#39;t explored India yet properly.

546,2023-01-27T11:27:13Z,The news does show Northeast women being racially molested and raped but they are insted accused of prostition.. like wtf india we know thats your type but comon
547,2023-01-27T11:26:24Z,The news shows you it because it&#39;s a problem that needs to be addressed
548,2023-01-27T11:10:00Z,"Ya all those look hazy at a distance, no thanks."
549,2023-01-27T10:41:29Z,well derp. but thats the point. in the major cities. you sound like a bad jingle promo for oil death barons.
550,2023-01-27T10:29:12Z,Media fake news after seeing this : baby I didn&#39;t even exist I am a hallucination
551,2023-01-27T10:02:42Z,It still looks pretty bad even when it&#39;s &quot;clear&quot;

557,2023-01-27T08:42:08Z,Why is there a vague fog in the distance in all the &quot;year round&quot; pictures? I&#39;m wondering what your standards for air pollutions are
558,2023-01-27T08:19:15Z,all hazy (comparatively) till the last slide
559,2023-01-27T08:09:32Z,the point is that it should look like that 0 months of the year.
560,2023-01-27T07:24:58Z,There is even south of India... Not only north
561,2023-01-27T06:42:21Z,Because their govt full in corruption

568,2023-01-27T04:28:42Z,"That&#39;s what they used to say in Los Angeles and London-- &quot;It&#39;s not always this bad!&quot;.  The chart you showed, on it&#39;s best day, is more than 3x the air pollution in most of the US.  We made so many mistakes when we industrialized-- and no one learned from our failures."
569,2023-01-27T03:59:21Z,1 MINUTE TOO MANY!! INDIANS HAVE THE SAME KINDA LUNGS
570,2023-01-27T03:54:30Z,Punjab and Kashmir are clean and green... I miss my stay there... Love it....
571,2023-01-27T03:43:42Z,Let&#39;s see the filthy water in the cities.
572,2023-01-27T03:37:55Z,Kindly visit South India Tamilnadu and kerala
573,2023-01-27T03:18:30Z,"There is a misconception in d world , in whichever part of india a negative thing happens , they say d whole india is lk ds"
574,2023-01-27T03:00:24Z,Ok. But how will the people know that they are in India and not Nepal. We need the grime. Or else you could be fucking anywhere. It’s like the yellow tint for Mexico!!!-this comment was brought to you my the CEO of MGM
575,2023-01-27T01:30:20Z,"the funny part is that even the parts that he says are clean in the country, are still way more polluted than what I&#39;m used to. A.d Delhi in the &quot;not bad&quot; season is still &quot;unhealthy&quot;."
576,2023-01-27T01:02:39Z,Does anyone know the music in the background?
577,2023-01-27T00:21:37Z,I did some work in Mumbai years ago and it was beautiful.
578,2023-01-26T23:51:48Z,There is another misconception that only north part off India exists and the media never talks about the south which it my opinion it more beautiful and vast
579,2023-01-26T23:39:26Z,The day after divali and pollution go hand in hand ngl
580,2023-01-26T23:17:28Z,such a gross city
581,2023-01-26T22:36:32Z,"&quot;yeah, India has a manmade smog covering it, but not always!&quot;"
582,2023-01-26T22:29:29Z,I seen a video where an Indian guy actively shatting in the street when suddenly he slips in his own faeces. In the process of the falling his head fell under a truck’s back tire. Then you can imagine. Like popping a pimple.
583,2023-01-26T22:23:30Z,"News dont show india at all, what is there to show"
584,2023-01-26T21:55:57Z,what a sweet voice
585,2023-01-26T21:50:57Z,The fact that the air hets hazardous yearly is very bad
586,2023-01-26T21:29:57Z,Only a few months huh! So during those months in North India what is really going on during that time. Most travelers don&#39;t go to those outside the mega city areas do they? Great explanation of how toxic it can be to breathe in India
587,2023-01-26T21:26:16Z,Only in the few poor places in India.
588,2023-01-26T20:52:10Z,I hope to visit some day
589,2023-01-26T20:28:37Z,this doesnt make it ok tho...
590,2023-01-26T20:07:14Z,The media doesn&#39;t show  the crushing poverty by the majority of the people.  They like to show you how rich and prosperous it is.  total lie.  it&#39;s also doesn&#39;t tell you the caste system is alive and well.  also it is not really a democracy.  only a few rich families control the country.  phoney
591,2023-01-26T19:41:26Z,"Still, India is the dirtiest most disgusting place I&#39;ve seen. The only country with worst air is China"
592,2023-01-26T19:29:14Z,Hi Indians. What is the best time to visit your beautiful country?
593,2023-01-26T19:22:57Z,But America is the problem???
594,2023-01-26T19:14:17Z,This is why India is near the top of my travel bucket list
595,2023-01-26T19:08:16Z,Do one about the poo beaches
596,2023-01-26T19:02:16Z,But in reality it looks dirty and unhygienic
597,2023-01-26T18:28:08Z,"Because even just a part of India look like that, it&#39;s still a part of India. If only there&#39;s non part of India look like that. The media maybe the blame for made people thinking it&#39;s all of India but India need to blame themselves for the existence of this size of pollution that in India."
598,2023-01-26T18:22:50Z,People believe what they want to believe.
599,2023-01-26T18:09:57Z,Even the &quot;clear&quot; days are smoggy. No thanks.
600,2023-01-26T18:06:14Z,But people gripe that America is the issue with pollution
601,2023-01-26T18:00:04Z,Air pollution in India is much much worse than those of China but we hardly hear a peep from anyone about it cause nobody cares about India
602,2023-01-26T17:59:22Z,Why to only show good side of a single country?
603,2023-01-26T17:47:13Z,Nobody cares about India
604,2023-01-26T17:41:52Z,Karl posts video showcasing the reality. mainstream media: arey ye to apni dhoti khol raha hein
605,2023-01-26T17:34:41Z,And the orange filter
606,2023-01-26T17:33:11Z,"Nobody thinks the whole of India looks like that, and it doesn&#39;t make it any less bad."
607,2023-01-26T17:11:08Z,Thank you brother for showing the real side
608,2023-01-26T17:05:13Z,There&#39;s also snow in some parts of india
609,2023-01-26T17:04:57Z,"In reality a lot of India looks and smells smoky year around, even in the countryside from frequently burning."
610,2023-01-26T17:03:44Z,"Same with America, and lots of other countries, news just shows obesity, school shootings, and all the bad things that happen, they just ignore the rest."
611,2023-01-26T17:03:19Z,Doesn’t matter India is still scammer central and nothing nice comes from India
612,2023-01-26T17:00:01Z,Pollution&#39;s the least of my concerns if I&#39;m traveling to India haha
613,2023-01-26T16:40:15Z,Please do visit Nagaland .
614,2023-01-26T16:36:58Z,"Tbh, the air looks like crap on those &quot;better day&quot; videos as well..."
615,2023-01-26T16:13:56Z,The chart you showed indicated that the air was continuously unhealthy.
616,2023-01-26T16:12:30Z,Thanks bro
617,2023-01-26T15:48:45Z,Love from

625,2023-01-26T14:20:23Z,"I don&#39;t blame the news for this, i blame the tourists.  They come, visits the most populared and polluted areas, leaves with bad memories."
626,2023-01-26T14:12:12Z,No one cares about blue skies. Just clouds of pollution
627,2023-01-26T14:09:22Z,Like bcz of my love chhattisgarh
628,2023-01-26T14:00:46Z,"We are not shown the mega-tonnes of plastic that litter the whole country. Everywhere, in cities or in the middle of nowhere..."

630,2023-01-26T13:41:16Z,Your accent becomes more and more Microsoft techsupportish
631,2023-01-26T13:39:27Z,Karl i had a mis conception abt u being not a friend of India. But your the opposite. Respect to you mate keep it up.
632,2023-01-26T13:34:45Z,And according to whatsapp university graduates those factors are like diwali fireworks and diwali fireworks and also only diwali fireworks.
633,2023-01-26T13:19:18Z,India smells like poop and trash all year round tho
634,2023-01-26T13:12:54Z,Ok lemme make it positiveMedia shows like this do that wr can work upon the dirty air and try to make our country 100% clean
635,2023-01-26T12:46:40Z,"BECAUSE IT&#39;S NOT NEWS WHEN IT&#39;S NORMAL, idjiot!Why do you love attacking the media for showing what they&#39;re supposed to show?The bad sides are shown in the hopes of stimulating action to address the problems.What do you want? Media like those in autocratic countries? Well I guess that&#39;s what you want being a Modi fanatic."
636,2023-01-26T12:39:24Z,India is destroying earth ?
637,2023-01-26T12:19:37Z,&quot;3 idiots&quot; showed me breathtaking India and been in my bucket list since.
638,2023-01-26T11:21:51Z,"Why would the news show us how pretty India is? It&#39;s the news, not a travel brochure."
639,2023-01-26T10:54:44Z,Because our media is Almost under our government control(godi media)
640,2023-01-26T10:46:32Z,India and China is going to be he death of the Earth.

643,2023-01-26T10:06:17Z,"Come to Bhubaneswar, capital city of Odisha... Ur eye will get shocked"
644,2023-01-26T09:39:22Z,Yeah except for the capital city of Delhi whenever I reach there the first thing I notice after getting off the plane is the air quality.
645,2023-01-26T09:24:17Z,Delhi air is always carrying that inherent haze tbh
646,2023-01-26T09:19:22Z,The news shows always only the bad side with everything
647,2023-01-26T09:11:18Z,"sorry to my Indian friends India is the most filthy country in the world including most of the people, i helped a friend who brought an apartment from an indian couple, it took 3 people a week to clean it"
648,2023-01-26T08:40:48Z,Love from chhattisgarh
649,2023-01-26T08:27:21Z,It&#39;s still not a clean country
650,2023-01-26T07:36:11Z,"Oh yea? Only 3 months of the year living in cancerous smog, sounds so much better"
651,2023-01-26T07:33:42Z,Thankyou for the brighter sight
652,2023-01-26T07:10:17Z,Why do they have a mob grinder
653,2023-01-26T07:06:02Z,"I never see any creator put chattisgarh in their video, I get really excited whenever I see someone promote Chattisgarh. Even though it&#39;s not as developed as some major states (but one of the fastest developing states), Chattisgarh has it&#39;s people, who are hospitable and generous, Has Nature surrounding everywhere (3rd largest forest coverage in India), Great for people who love to travel Natural habitat (Visit Mainpat once), Also has abundant natural resources."
654,2023-01-26T06:59:22Z,Jealousy brings biasness

658,2023-01-26T05:45:45Z,"People not  from America assume that we&#39;re all potential murderers, well armed"
659,2023-01-26T05:31:55Z,just because you cant see it doesn’t mean the air isn’t toxic.
660,2023-01-26T05:29:59Z,What the left thinks the earth is going to look like in 5 years:
661,2023-01-26T05:22:52Z,As an Indian I felt glad to see the reality which you brought to your audience... thanks carl
662,2023-01-26T05:18:49Z,Who told you this misconception bruh
663,2023-01-26T05:16:27Z,Karl rock really rocks in india
664,2023-01-26T04:37:35Z,India always smells like that all year round though
665,2023-01-26T04:31:05Z,"I have been to South Goa, India, it&#39;s very beautiful with great beaches and warm sunlight. The restaurants are great and the people are really nice too, would recommend going!"
666,2023-01-26T04:19:13Z,"Just came back from India.Pune, Dheli and Mumbai is polluted all year road, the air remains very poor and below WHO standards.Smog is perennial but pollution is constant.The pungent toxic smell in most large cities does by cease any part of the year"
667,2023-01-26T04:01:22Z,"The horizon looks fucked, are you going to tell us China isn&#39;t polluted to high heaven too?"
668,2023-01-26T03:59:59Z,Naw it do tho
669,2023-01-26T03:55:21Z,consuming some amount of poison each year and sneezing that sheet in usa
670,2023-01-26T03:41:44Z,Misconception? I&#39;ve never heard that India has an air pollution problem!
671,2023-01-26T03:24:28Z,That&#39;s very true
672,2023-01-26T03:03:22Z,Every coin has two sides
673,2023-01-26T02:58:18Z,The last pic is my home
674,2023-01-26T02:56:00Z,Netherlands never looks like that.
675,2023-01-26T02:48:53Z,I would not go live in India if you gave me 50 millions.
676,2023-01-26T02:44:03Z,My friend told me the air smells like fart all year round.
677,2023-01-26T01:52:58Z,But in reality that&#39;s Los Angeles
678,2023-01-26T01:06:06Z,"I went to Delhi a couple years back. It&#39;s exactly like what you see in the movies as soon as you get out of the hotels districts. Go to Thailand instead, it&#39;s like what you think India will be like, but actually is."
679,2023-01-26T00:43:11Z,It&#39;s a serious issue tho
680,2023-01-26T00:03:55Z,There’s a misconception that Biden is good and doesn’t deal with terrorists but the news doesn’t show you that do they?
681,2023-01-25T23:56:27Z,Reminds me of Tehran lol.
682,2023-01-25T23:37:53Z,The news doesnt show any side because ain&#39;t shit happen in india that anyone but indians care about
683,2023-01-25T23:24:07Z,you know what else your ass should show how like half of indias population likes off under 7 dollars a day
684,2023-01-25T22:18:31Z,Well do me a favor and smell the air
685,2023-01-25T22:15:26Z,It’s the filth that’s a constant
686,2023-01-25T20:56:46Z,Nature ... is pretty big tho eh? ...
687,2023-01-25T20:47:20Z,It sucks the filthy scammers have left such a black eye on India
688,2023-01-25T20:33:42Z,"To be fair, the fact that the graph starts at &quot;unhealthy&quot; makes it a bit dubious."
689,2023-01-25T20:31:50Z,India looks expensive to live in but also too trashy to live in
690,2023-01-25T20:12:17Z,Still looks foggy af in the clean air months.
691,2023-01-25T20:03:46Z,Still garbage air should never be that dirty.   Sure it ain&#39;t during the entire year but that fact it&#39;s like that 1 month of every year is horrible and nasty
692,2023-01-25T19:53:19Z,That air still looks dirty. Then again most cities look to have dirty air to me. That isn&#39;t even counting the smell of stale air that permeates cities and the surrounding areas. Even large towns suffer a little most of the time.
693,2023-01-25T19:12:19Z,Yeah because no one cares about your country lol
694,2023-01-25T18:55:03Z,"Love you, man. Early on I thought you would be the type of traveller who pumps India just for the viewership. But you stayed and did more for the country than many of us do."
695,2023-01-25T18:48:02Z,India is beautiful
696,2023-01-25T18:15:15Z,Outside of the what cities???
697,2023-01-25T18:11:29Z,this is literally the first time im seeing what india really looks like
698,2023-01-25T17:53:23Z,It&#39;s time to visit Uttrakhand
699,2023-01-25T17:52:20Z,"they dont, infact they show india as a slum, which btw, WE ARE NOT. they just want to say &quot;yea west is rich you are SO POOOOR give up trying, or you will end up like africa&quot; (africa still has more recources than the west)"
700,2023-01-25T17:45:31Z,Yeah but you just showed that the average air quality is unhealthy 12 months a year
701,2023-01-25T17:17:25Z,It&#39;s like the entire western news hate India for some reason
702,2023-01-25T16:55:18Z,Maybe they do not report on the other times because that is how it is supposed to be at all times?  You do not see the news reporting on how clear the skies are in rural Indiana!  It should not be a hazard to your health in any region at any time of year.
703,2023-01-25T16:43:43Z,Uttarakhand  the heaven itself
704,2023-01-25T16:42:49Z,"this guy found out exactly what Indians want to hear and made a living out of it, no matter how ridiculous it is"
705,2023-01-25T16:42:08Z,Make a video about all the thrash
706,2023-01-25T16:40:03Z,India has streets for open defecation
707,2023-01-25T16:37:54Z,wait till those mofos come to himachal
708,2023-01-25T16:30:34Z,Glad Chhattisgarh is also not polluted like that.
709,2023-01-25T16:16:47Z,India not is only has worst air pollution but also very dirty in mostly of its cities.
710,2023-01-25T16:14:39Z,INDIA WOOOO
711,2023-01-25T16:02:12Z,Thanks sir to show the real image of india
712,2023-01-25T15:50:43Z,the fact that the taj mahal literally went 90% visibility during the early pandemic just says something
713,2023-01-25T15:41:50Z,"Its not news when there is clean air, because clean is the norm in all habitable places by default. They report when there is lack of it. Its like you saying well in US majority schools don&#39;t have school shooting but the news doesn&#39;t show you that."
714,2023-01-25T15:41:19Z,"Bangladesh looks like that, and I have proof"
715,2023-01-25T15:27:20Z,Depends on the news u watch
716,2023-01-25T15:21:33Z,I’m in Mumbai not in North India and I saw poor visibility back from September till now. So much for a couple of months. Plus even couple months of horrendous AQI is really bad for health. Even in moderate AQI it is recommended to wear a mask.
717,2023-01-25T15:10:55Z,That country is smelly discusting. Too many of them come to Canada and bring all sorts of diseases and viruses. Punjabs are responsible for bringing Delta variant to Canada 2 years ago!!!!
718,2023-01-25T15:03:47Z,I&#39;m originally from kolkata and I wish the news did show This side. They made it illegal to publish information on air quality and its getting pretty dangerous.
719,2023-01-25T14:51:09Z,Yeah it&#39;s a massive call conspiracy /s
720,2023-01-25T14:47:13Z,What about the water?
721,2023-01-25T14:46:59Z,As an Indian. This is correct. While some cities are extremely polluted and the air is hazardous. Reaching an average AQI of 350. Other cities and villages have clean air. But where air is polluted it is extremely bad.
722,2023-01-25T14:27:02Z,also china
723,2023-01-25T14:08:44Z,Proudly Indian
724,2023-01-25T13:47:33Z,South India has some air pollution but not much
725,2023-01-25T13:39:34Z,I&#39;m from Chhattisgarh Jay johar
726,2023-01-25T13:28:46Z,Poverty porn! Ever heard about that?
727,2023-01-25T13:26:56Z,THE FACT IT LOOKS LIKE THAT AT ALL MEANS ITS TIME TO MOVE!!!
728,2023-01-25T13:17:55Z,goa and the very nouthern and southern regions are the most beautiful
729,2023-01-25T13:08:47Z,Well i wasn&#39;t expecting cg in the short but  it&#39;s nice to see my state getting recognised
730,2023-01-25T13:04:07Z,Please visit kerela the monsoons here are  a thing of beauty
731,2023-01-25T12:45:48Z,"It&#39;s not about news media showing about it specifically. I am a student in University here in the city and I belong from outside. For a major part of year, atleast 5 months, the air in Delhi remains like that. And yes, it is an important issue. Even when it looks clear as in latter drone shots, AQI is nowhere below 200 anytime in year in Delhi."
732,2023-01-25T12:38:27Z,nobody:Actually nobodyI&#39;m serious nobody:nobody here:Nobody on this plane of existence:&quot;iNdIa LoOkS lIkE a SmOkErS lUnGs&quot; -
733,2023-01-25T12:11:43Z,So without the smog it looks worse. Got it
734,2023-01-25T12:01:31Z,thanks Karl
735,2023-01-25T11:54:01Z,Indians: &quot;they think we have polluted air &quot;Arabs: &quot;Can we swap roles?&quot;
736,2023-01-25T11:50:33Z,It’s almost like the news wasn’t trying to film a travel brochure for India but rather was trying to highlight something potentially dangerous and that might need to be looked into more. Everybody is so pretentious now
737,2023-01-25T11:32:21Z,The air has never been cleaner. Since the 1950&#39;s governments have brought in Clean Air Acts.
738,2023-01-25T11:31:44Z,it’s still a problem though
739,2023-01-25T11:27:31Z,"I was in India on March 2019 visiting Delhi, Jaipur and Agra. And all those cities were envelopes by fog for so bad. Can&#39;t take proper picture on tourist sites without fog in the background"
740,2023-01-25T10:53:48Z,Thanks for showing me this. Was keeping me awake at night.
741,2023-01-25T10:41:41Z,This video was incomplete without Uttarakhand....thanks for showing it. Thanks Karl

744,2023-01-25T10:25:02Z,Thank you Karl for what you have contributed.
745,2023-01-25T09:41:42Z,Uttarakhand  Land of Gods
746,2023-01-25T09:25:45Z,"great place to visit, just watch where you step!"
747,2023-01-25T09:16:43Z,Sometimes there is just fog in the air and people took it as air pollution
748,2023-01-25T09:10:42Z,Yet the problem is humans breathing air and causing the emissions going higher....lol..look at all these factories around the world
749,2023-01-25T09:10:24Z,My hometown muzaffarpur looks awesome all the time....
750,2023-01-25T08:25:56Z,Honestly there&#39;s a few places in CANADA that the sky is yellow with pollution. Hamilton Ontario especially.
751,2023-01-25T08:15:59Z,Any metro cities has very serious problem of pollution because of development
752,2023-01-25T07:02:17Z,yeah all that news that is happening in regional india all the time who would have thought
753,2023-01-25T06:57:39Z,Why would the news show you that side? THERE SHOULDN&#39;T BE SMOG LIKE THAT AT ANY POINT OF THE YEAR. The fact that you think it&#39;s acceptable means you&#39;re too far gone and are actually hopeless.
754,2023-01-25T06:20:22Z,"damn thus guy is just determined to break india&#39;s stereotypes, appreciate it a lot"
755,2023-01-25T05:58:32Z,Hope you are back to india
756,2023-01-25T05:44:06Z,Delhi looks like that all year round
757,2023-01-25T05:37:50Z,Kerala is very beautiful bro
758,2023-01-25T05:17:38Z,Pollution is a national issue of india. India needs educated PM who can acknowledge this fact.
759,2023-01-25T05:16:11Z,"Don&#39;t worry about the warnings, just because it&#39;s sometimes deadly to be here, it&#39;s still cool."
760,2023-01-25T05:03:45Z,Because ur not supposed to have that at all
761,2023-01-25T05:00:44Z,The air is still filthy.
762,2023-01-25T04:59:54Z,The Urban/Metro cities are very polluted in India
763,2023-01-25T04:49:48Z,"India is still heavily polluted, that’s a fact."
764,2023-01-25T04:00:55Z,why? The reason - only bad things need to be solved
765,2023-01-25T00:53:26Z,"Not only india , same in Nepal"
766,2023-01-24T20:19:38Z,bro know the power of putting India in the title
767,2023-01-24T19:39:19Z,Sell Pakistan so  we can feed you
768,2023-01-24T19:01:50Z,"Oh really ? Media there show India like that? Well as an Indian, I can confirm  the reality is very different. Also, the unclear vision is not because of air pollution, rather because of fog in cond areas."
769,2023-01-24T18:31:04Z,news busy in Hindu Muslims.
770,2023-01-24T16:32:30Z,India has pretty much good air all the year.
771,2023-01-24T13:50:53Z,"karl rock, bro, keep on. we r proud of having a son in law like you."
772,2023-01-24T13:49:38Z,"Why should the news show the normal things? Clean air is abundant on planet earth, it&#39;s the human interventions that make it polluted and India is an example for that"
773,2023-01-24T13:32:34Z,India is a beautiful place i wanna visit one day...
774,2023-01-24T13:15:08Z,Yea you are right

776,2023-01-24T11:40:57Z,That&#39;s Right
777,2023-01-24T11:03:09Z,"But still it’s unhealthy to live here though, we should not ignore our problems"
778,2023-01-24T09:44:25Z,Northeastern States
779,2023-01-24T08:23:14Z,Yeah my india is awesome
780,2023-01-24T08:19:05Z,"In Macedonia during the winter it&#39;s very polluted because some people still use wood heaters, but during the summer the air is very clean."
781,2023-01-24T08:11:18Z,But here in Kolkata always air looks like this hazy

799,2023-01-23T16:52:55Z,This was the guy who kept abusing India
800,2023-01-23T16:11:28Z,"Untill it is AAP in Delhi, the first image is what will be shown. That too whole year."
801,2023-01-23T16:03:21Z,Brother you should visit odisha once
802,2023-01-23T15:32:36Z,"Bravo...People&#39;s like you can&#39;t be fooled by so called democratic wester media houses.Off course Whole Bharat is trying to reduce all types of dangerous pollution and all Bharatiya peoples will do it within few years.Current Best patriotic Modi government also trying to make whole Bharat as well as world pollution free not only material pollution but also pollution of thoughts and nudity and vulgarity.That&#39;d why Sanatani / Hindu says&quot;Vasudhaiv Kutumbkam!&quot;It means Whole world is one family.Sarve bhavantu sukhinaIt means May everyone be happy, may everyone be healthy, may everyone see what is favorable, and may no one suffer.I hope now wise peoples must have understood that Bhartiya sanatan vedik dharma culture is not to bound with skin color, countries boundaries, narrow minded ideologies, hatred based religions."
803,2023-01-23T15:30:24Z,"Ohh Showcasing only North India doesn&#39;t end Look at Bengaluru, it has best weather in the whole country"

813,2023-01-23T10:58:56Z,I can’t decide whether I hate this guy or I like him. Some of posts are quite conflicting. Although this one is so true.
814,2023-01-23T10:09:26Z,Western propaganda
815,2023-01-23T09:18:11Z,So true. I am from Kolkata but I went to Delhi last October and it really was very polluted that time.

818,2023-01-23T08:55:01Z,"Uhh why would they show you the good air. That is what&#39;s expected, what should be normal. Its the pollution that is news worthy. So the news shows the news. Pretty obvious.You&#39;ll find the good air on travel blog channels where it belongs."
819,2023-01-23T08:05:46Z,When u live in that country u try hard to defend it anyway
820,2023-01-23T06:57:04Z,Love you bro.. for showing it to the world!
821,2023-01-23T06:48:00Z,Why do the media &amp; tourist show only the northern part of India.India is a diverse country checkout south India you will never see the pollution
822,2023-01-23T05:25:02Z,Ahh uttrakhand my hometown

825,2023-01-23T03:28:33Z,Another godi median on YouTube . Typically Indian accept the truth
826,2023-01-23T02:09:02Z,There is no misconception actually most part of india is polluted heavily throughout the year no wonder you are doing this for just views
827,2023-01-23T01:14:23Z,We know India is beautiful. We don&#39;t need western certificate.
828,2023-01-23T01:09:25Z,Uttrakhand is diffffrent
829,2023-01-23T00:33:01Z,"But it actually still happen there right?? So there&#39;s no misconception here.In my city, its never happened"
830,2023-01-22T19:26:40Z,News is about pollution not about cow farming
831,2023-01-22T17:51:37Z,I never knew there was smog type conditions in India.
832,2023-01-22T17:18:48Z,This guy is Indian now...
833,2023-01-22T17:08:13Z,One can feel the difference once they step outside the plane ( not the cleanest air )  in Delhi as compared to other cities
834,2023-01-22T17:02:35Z,"But the truth is It is  we really need a standard pavement , road and seriously need to atleast a policy with fine for littering ( It may sound like childish but there&#39;s no other way people gonna do unless by force ) proper junkyard, distinguished garbage bin for every street that workers can take .( Recycle , degredable , biodegradable , that stuff) clean up the swamp almost everywhere in india . Need a neat public restroom which could not be find anywhere in India I could complain government for the building structure in some case and poor maintenance in some case but people&#39;s sense at the most complainable they won&#39;t use it properly even( guess it can&#39;t be changed unless people&#39;s mind changes )"
835,2023-01-22T16:35:19Z,My Chattisgarh

837,2023-01-22T16:26:33Z,Wait !where is Kerala ???
838,2023-01-22T15:27:49Z,stubble burning is main reason
839,2023-01-22T15:03:36Z,And that some times u mentioned is in winter cz the colder air is denser and stays on the ground. This colder air accumulates gassious particles and makes the air foggy.
840,2023-01-22T14:47:45Z,Chhattisgarh
841,2023-01-22T13:02:28Z,"I am indian, I live here in North india. no carl you are in illusion . we live in deadly pollution at least for 9 months except mandoon three months. air is extremely dangerous in entire North india most of thr months"
842,2023-01-22T12:45:30Z,Media only works for TRP and Money.Change my mind
843,2023-01-22T12:24:21Z,Stubble burning captured
844,2023-01-22T12:19:07Z,"It&#39;s actually not even states , it&#39;s limited to few cities and some mega cities also report clean air throughout year"
845,2023-01-22T12:00:15Z,not even whole north india come visit our uttrakhand or Himachal any month of the year you will love nature here
846,2023-01-22T11:17:59Z,The modern and western media are always making efforts to humiliate India and to show the 70 year old uncivilized India....So sad .......
847,2023-01-22T10:03:29Z,In fact the air quality in the city of Mumbai becomes the one of the best in the world at certain points in the monsoon season.
848,2023-01-22T09:48:47Z,im from chhattisghar

859,2023-01-22T06:09:08Z,"South India&#39;s air is very clean. I wish North and Eastern India to take good steps like efficient waste management systems, infrastructure redevelopments,  more native trees,  more investment in renewable energy for having clean air,water and land."

862,2023-01-22T05:40:21Z,Feels like it looks that though
863,2023-01-22T05:30:08Z,"So you’re just ignoring how the cities looks in winter where millions of people live so that you can claim India is cleaner by showing villages? And if the news is about hazardous air quality, why would it show a random village in Maharashtra?"
864,2023-01-22T04:05:21Z,"Thank you for showing us  the real India, not the image that main stream media want us to believe."
865,2023-01-22T03:56:59Z,Bro please visit Once in Uttarakhand
866,2023-01-22T03:08:30Z,"It&#39;s only Delhi that&#39;s like that. Get outside the city and when they aren&#39;t burning paddy husk in October, it is fantastic. But yes, Indian cities are just too big. But when the lockdown happened the air was so clean we could see to the Himalayas and the Ganges became transparent. Shows you what we have done."
867,2023-01-22T00:43:04Z,But when they horn…. Daaamn

876,2023-01-21T15:08:01Z,Come to Himachal and Uttarakhand
877,2023-01-21T14:37:12Z,This happens due to Western Hypocrisy
878,2023-01-21T13:37:53Z,"Yeah they show brown indian people in Hollywood, didn&#39;t they saw virat kohli, sachin or north indians. Then who will look at their heroes instead is d fear"
879,2023-01-21T13:11:14Z,Bring this man back to India next time he won&#39;t go to Pakistan.
880,2023-01-21T12:51:45Z,"It is good  that bad parts of india is well known because If good places are shown, then how will the citizens of India remain alert that they should not pollute the country?"
881,2023-01-21T12:43:35Z,"The media don&#39;t show us the Negative Side(Drugs, Alcohol, Depression, Stress...) of USA. Likewise they won&#39;t show the Positive Side(Satisfaction, History, Applicable Knowledge, Culture, Nature....) of India"
882,2023-01-21T12:32:02Z,"We never show our reality let other be in misconception,                             ~by me"
883,2023-01-21T11:11:54Z,"As an Indian from WB, I thought that Delhi was polluted all year, just that diwali time it gets extreme. Ok I was white washed. Thanks Karl for correcting it"
884,2023-01-21T10:42:23Z,"Why aren&#39;t the woke green ppl losing their shit over over countries massively polluting? Cause they hypocrites. I would never go to India. Several have gas station around and some are nice, but some are perverts and never buy American cars. It&#39;s annoying when ppl come over and refuse to buy American made stuff like they despise us yet wanna reap our benefits. Imagine Americans going to some other countries, we would not be safe and those countries wouldn&#39;t help us at all. Seems like these ppl should have more respect and have some gratitude for it being completely one way in terms of safety, support and hospitality."
885,2023-01-21T10:05:44Z,love from madhya pradesh

890,2023-01-21T08:00:23Z,Because our media is paid to do that
891,2023-01-21T07:56:24Z,"That&#39;s true Karl, but even during the months  of low air pollution as your own chart shows AQA is above 150 which is still unhealthy. Thousands of Indians die prematurely due to air pollution. It is time to hold people to account."
892,2023-01-21T07:46:18Z,Thank you for showing reality of my country
893,2023-01-21T07:07:30Z,Negative news are news nowadays It&#39;s a common thing
894,2023-01-21T05:46:05Z,"Most of the time it&#39;s like Southern states here, many places are like California weather wise, some costal cities are like Florida / houstan"
895,2023-01-21T04:15:04Z,Same case with Pakistan.

909,2023-01-20T11:44:06Z,Before you showed the cloudy weather i think it is fog because in my area also fog happens only in the morning
910,2023-01-20T11:05:50Z,"No bro it&#39;s DIWALI, making whole world polluted  :- librandus"
911,2023-01-20T11:01:32Z,Thats why we call them godi media
912,2023-01-20T10:57:14Z,Bro but if you check air quality index live then result is something else..
913,2023-01-20T10:34:12Z,"Karl - Respect for you has grown many folds now. Even though what happened,  you are still there to clear the misconceptions in India. Fan now"
914,2023-01-20T10:26:06Z,The polluting ones never change.

916,2023-01-20T07:39:21Z,"This year, Delhi&#39;s pollution was least when compared to last 10 years! All thanks to our CM Arvind Kejriwal.Thanks a lot Karl for clearing this misconception"
917,2023-01-20T07:34:24Z,Media Is Corrupt And Lousy.
918,2023-01-20T06:58:47Z,Karl ... I admire you a lot... Keep up the good work
919,2023-01-20T04:42:21Z,yellow filter or Mexican filter
920,2023-01-20T03:43:13Z,Not really. There&#39;s plastic and garbage burning in most places. You can smell it. Garbage thrown in random places.
921,2023-01-20T02:01:18Z,We as Indians should take initiative to bring this up and clear misconceptions foreign  media
922,2023-01-19T19:57:38Z,The Delhi ISBT smells like a public toilet year around
923,2023-01-19T18:25:34Z,"But the infrastructure of india is probably the worst in the world. I went to combodia and veitnam last year and even they are more developed than india. No broken roads, no potholes, no especially no dust. There is so much dust everywhere in india."
924,2023-01-19T18:06:58Z,Indian government is not stable
925,2023-01-19T16:07:27Z,Not only the news a lot of Americans still think China buys our recycling and is covered in smog. The smoke picture looked like my city a couple months ago due to forest fires
926,2023-01-19T15:07:59Z,Dude the air quality still is terrible hahaha compared to the US......and the whole country smells like feces due to the lack of sewer systems hahaha
927,2023-01-19T13:26:58Z,Nice of you to defend india. I am from india. Delhi is awful.
928,2023-01-19T13:23:48Z,Whether news channels show the other side or not. Air pollution is there even though its in selected places. So focus should be on that.
929,2023-01-19T13:19:17Z,Like the way you used to show
930,2023-01-19T11:23:41Z,Make Karl a MP. Pretty sure he&#39;d do a better job than the clowns we&#39;ve elected. I&#39;d vote for him if he ran for PM !
931,2023-01-19T11:20:35Z,bro come in Jammu and Kashmir
932,2023-01-19T10:55:32Z,"And thanks these indian parts, lahore is also covered with smoke"
933,2023-01-19T10:02:34Z,"Uttrakhand, in the end"
934,2023-01-19T06:29:57Z,People judge india just by seeing i city or one state but actually India is one country many world.
935,2023-01-19T05:28:55Z,"Oh thank you brother, I lived in nz being a resident too but even the media in nz shows the poor people and negativity about india. Well, thanks for sharing the good too"
936,2023-01-19T04:26:59Z,Come visit Northeast India .
937,2023-01-19T04:25:41Z,India is also full of Islamic terrorism
938,2023-01-19T03:49:39Z,My suggestion is stay away from India. If you don&#39;t know anything about this land.
939,2023-01-19T03:35:30Z,Delhi in the summer is still more polluted than anywhere in the us
940,2023-01-18T21:55:34Z,"I honestly rarely see media portray India at all, but the numbers speak for themselves of the most polluted cities in the world almost all are China and India"
941,2023-01-18T20:51:31Z,Karl I’m haryanvi living in NZ for 10 years and I reckon it’s paradise on the face of earth. When ever I go back to India I always land at night time so I can get away from Delhi ASAP. Life is much better and easier in the countryside Haryana. I was there during Covid for 6 months and absolutely loved it in my fields.
942,2023-01-18T18:48:09Z,"It is my dream to visit Varanasi as well as the Taj Mahal, I&#39;m an American. I&#39;ve never traveled abroard, and only traveled once alone in the states, and India seems like an intimidating place for a first time solo traveler in another country. Should I try visiting somewhere &quot;easier&quot; first like western europe?"
943,2023-01-18T17:37:53Z,trying hard to get manipulate Indian&#39;s but no matter you&#39;ll be deported one day permanently
944,2023-01-18T17:00:13Z,Excatly! Its like show Seattle or Vancouver during the time of forest fire and saying the entire country of USA or Canada is polluted.
945,2023-01-18T15:59:37Z,Thanks to the Crooked Western Media…
946,2023-01-18T14:11:39Z,"Guys, There is a Paradise which gives more earning to Indian Government is one and only South India, Please visit then you go nowhere in India."
947,2023-01-18T11:15:01Z,"Well, if the capital city of the fifth largest economy can’t even provide its citizens with clean air, there’s something deeply wrong."
948,2023-01-18T09:12:17Z,The first pictures you showed is Danny Boyle&#39;s perspective
949,2023-01-18T07:09:24Z,Thank You for showing Chhattisgarh

951,2023-01-18T03:43:26Z,"In the same way that we&#39;re always shown only particular streets of New York, Los Angeles etc leaving out scenes of So many homeless people&#39;s tents and all the Garbage on the streets etc. Thanks Karl"
952,2023-01-18T03:15:10Z,Thank you
953,2023-01-17T21:13:36Z,PunjabThe Punjab and Haryana regions are considered the breadbaskets of India.
954,2023-01-17T20:14:17Z,"Appreciate you always trying to show the positive side of my country. It takes a large heart to ownup a foreign country as a whole, along with all its blemishes."
955,2023-01-17T19:19:29Z,You need indian citizenship I guess
956,2023-01-17T18:55:15Z,Media doesn&#39;t show that part because only 2% live there
957,2023-01-17T17:43:00Z,he shows the good and bad about our country totally impartial .
958,2023-01-17T14:48:24Z,"Please do not spread false news. India is highly polluted and if we do not acknowledge that and act against it, we will suffer long term. It is already known that Indians are dying younger. One look at middle aged Indians with falling hair, pot belly, think legs and arms with barrel shaped chest shows the impact of all the pollution on the population of our country. Closing our eyes to the problem is a bigger problem. India is polluted, let us get it cleaner and less polluted so Indians lead a long, fruitful and healthy lives."
959,2023-01-17T14:37:21Z,They don&#39;t show the other side because it&#39;s of no concern to the environment or people&#39;s health. Not showing it is neglecting the facts and ultimately never getting corrected.
960,2023-01-17T13:22:21Z,"i don&#39;t even know they&#39;re have that fog things, all i knew is india is having musicality horns on the road"

976,2023-01-16T04:07:35Z,There&#39;s a misconception that it&#39;s somehow acceptable to have a hazardous level of pollution in your air literally ever
977,2023-01-16T04:06:04Z,Delhi and North India is where most of India stays...almost 40% of population confined in less than 15% of land area.

1013,2023-01-12T09:24:16Z,India has both sides. But western media always focus on chaotic streets n slums.

1015,2023-01-12T06:04:47Z,Thanks for showing reality.Western media always shows negative things about India and they always try to defame us
1016,2023-01-12T04:28:24Z,That&#39;s because of the precision propaganda preaching of the West.
1017,2023-01-11T15:00:26Z,Kudos to your dedication to whatever you do with so much conviction! Great content !
1018,2023-01-10T16:30:30Z,Thank you
1019,2023-01-10T08:23:56Z,You didn&#39;t have the courage to point fingers at the stubble burners
1020,2023-01-09T20:04:50Z,India is beautiful.  My state is trees trees trees . More trees than people. Himachal
1021,2023-01-09T06:24:23Z,How does it smellHeard that New Delhi and Mombai smell like a combination of raw sewage and Currie
1022,2023-01-04T02:19:01Z,That’s how they show Delhi..some of my friends there used to wear mask even at home before COVID times…because of the pollution.
1023,2022-12-29T21:03:28Z,Chhatisgarh
1024,2022-12-27T16:50:14Z,"Poverty, pollution, corruption, healthcare, women’s safety, illiteracy, education, infrastructure, unemployment, u could go on for days with the things India just refuses to catch up with the rest of the world on. And it’s all because of generations of corruption and outside influences like the US and Britain ruining and hindering progress. Not a place anybody should want to visit until they get it straight. It’s like poverty tourism. Too exploitative"
1025,2022-12-24T15:30:42Z,thnx for mentioning Maharashtra....but Goa too has most beautiful nature n forest
1026,2022-12-24T04:39:10Z,"Omg Uttarakhand! That’s Nainital, right? Because I’ve been there! Absolutely beautiful place"
1027,2022-12-24T04:35:53Z,"Visit northeast India, it looks as beautiful. I’ve been there before :)"
1028,2022-12-22T08:55:28Z,"i have grown in a city in India, but I have often visited my hometown at regular intervals from childhood. I actually love to spend time in my hometown than living in the city"
1029,2022-12-21T15:51:26Z,"Karl, you seem to be familiar with the northern and some central States of India.. I hope you would make videos of the southern and eastern states too.. I am sure you would like every state of India. Jai hind"
1030,2022-12-21T11:52:49Z,lots of love from India
1031,2022-12-20T13:31:57Z,"If you ever visit Uttrakhand, go to Almora, not Dehradun. Visit the districts that are less popular than others. The real beauty of a specific state can be seen there."
1032,2022-12-19T12:44:01Z,I proud to be an Indian
1033,2022-12-16T16:52:55Z,"I believe there are a lot of misconceptions about India as well as many other places around the world. American people have been under a shrouded veil, rose colored glasses... whet ever you want to call it. Thank you Karl for &quot;clearing the air&quot; about India."
1034,2022-12-16T14:17:14Z,South india is the best
1035,2022-12-16T09:26:57Z,I think you not yet visited south indian it is very beautiful and less polluted than delhi
1036,2022-12-15T14:43:23Z,"Thank you, Karl. Huge fan!"
1037,2022-12-14T07:21:59Z,@Karl i would like to show u more sides of my country which the people doesn&#39;t see outside.
1038,2022-12-13T17:05:19Z,"Karl if you love india come visit Manipur in the northeast state...no.1 fresh lake in asia, SANGAI(like deer) our state animal only habitats in  keibul lamjao national park, SHIRUI LILY state flower only found in shirui hill and many more beauty nature horrific CAVES and many more"
1039,2022-12-12T08:02:02Z,"That&#39;s because they&#39;re fake news =)at least maybe only a few news companies sourcesI think I already presumed some areas in India are fine regarding clean air and low air pollution and low environment pollutionstill, about specific short periods of a few months every year in specific areas regarding times of air pollution, good to know.I think it&#39;s deceptive when they (the news) show it/that without saying clearly and precisely that it&#39;s only in a few northern areas for only a few months every year.So it&#39;s important they present it in the news, but they have to be detailed and precised/accurate in the information they give."
1040,2022-12-10T10:29:08Z,Thanks brother
1041,2022-12-08T15:03:06Z,"Delhi is a part of India, but because of kejriuddin(C. M) it becomes a part of pollution..."
1042,2022-12-07T13:44:16Z,Chhattisgarh
1043,2022-12-07T07:24:36Z,Come visit North East India
1044,2022-12-04T07:58:49Z,"visit kerala and konkan coast ,u will never ever leave India for anything.india is incredible."
1045,2022-12-02T07:40:17Z,Delhi looks like that especially during winter. However when I&#39;ve been there in September it was actually clean
1046,2022-11-30T22:20:03Z,because of diwali festival there they fire crackers that&#39;s why it&#39;s get pollution ..
1047,2022-11-28T07:29:50Z,You are absolutely scamming Indians and foreigners. All major Indian cities apart from Bangalore have dangerous AQI level. Stop relaying bull** to Indians who are suffering from the problems of Air pollution. On any given day when has an Indian city had an AQI below 50 in 365 days? None of cities have done that in 10 years or so. Our coming generations face a very challenging future because of Air pollution and here you are on YouTube downgrading the urgency and playing with future lives.
1048,2022-11-27T10:35:00Z,"Still looks much worse than Pakistan. Even in polluted cities like Karachi, we have blue skies. So the rest of the cities perform even better. We have trees spread across the country while in India, trees are mostly present in South. So Pakistan wins the anti-pollution round."
1049,2022-11-25T11:02:10Z,Waiting for you to come Pakistan again
1050,2022-11-25T03:49:42Z,Come to Chandigarh and show all western people what is a green city look alike
1051,2022-11-24T19:35:55Z,"I love your channel, but please don&#39;t down play the levels of our pollution. Even when the air seems clear, our pollution levels in the air are higher than most other countries, which has a direct link to increased asthmatic and respiratory issues in India. The government needs to take a stand against this to preserve the people&#39;s health. Saying the air looks clean during different seasons does the people an injustice."
1052,2022-11-24T18:04:00Z,Calcutta was really bad even 10 years ago
1053,2022-11-24T13:52:50Z,Come to south india
1054,2022-11-24T13:35:38Z,Yes u can search India  kokan Ghats u will see some mind-blowing nature pic from India
1055,2022-11-24T07:37:50Z,Living in india for years I haven&#39;t been able to travel all the beautiful parts of India
1056,2022-11-24T06:50:51Z,"Yes this is so true,  I plan my stay in certain places according to the month of the year. I avoid Delhi mostly in &#39;Winters&#39;. ;)"
1057,2022-11-24T01:28:25Z,such a beautiful place!!
1058,2022-11-23T12:46:31Z,I m sad that u never travelled bihar and jharkhand i guess u don&#39;t want to visit here or like all people in India people look down upon bihar jharkhand and be racist upon them
1059,2022-11-23T12:22:28Z,I&#39;m from chhattisgarh
1060,2022-11-23T03:13:25Z,"its cuz of diwali only. no one should blame the innocent farmers, they put food on our table."
1061,2022-11-23T01:40:54Z,Dude obviously the air quality is better because of the reasons and the cold weather during the winter
1062,2022-11-22T16:56:45Z,Thanks  Brother
1063,2022-11-22T11:15:40Z,Thank you Karl for clearing the air:)
1064,2022-11-22T10:56:57Z,Thank you so much for your effort

1068,2022-11-21T15:43:59Z,"Is the indian air polution due to government negligence, corrruption or something else?"
1069,2022-11-21T13:29:15Z,You should come to Tamilnadu it&#39;s different from North india
1070,2022-11-21T08:20:16Z,only for Delhi bro ..not all india
1071,2022-11-21T03:55:54Z,Karl please visit our Darjeeling or Gangtok I m sure you will love our place
1072,2022-11-20T22:56:24Z,"India air quality is complete trash, don’t"
1073,2022-11-20T22:34:07Z,It looks horrible all year
1074,2022-11-20T15:48:00Z,You really love India
1075,2022-11-20T14:43:28Z,"Thats why i like you,you tell it like it is,no b.s..Thanks Karl."
1076,2022-11-20T13:14:59Z,Poverty sells more than prosperity
1077,2022-11-20T11:53:42Z,"Hey, how can I reach you via email? Do you have a website?"
1078,2022-11-20T11:05:39Z,Come to Hyderabad
1079,2022-11-20T10:23:18Z,Holy shit you even gained a slight indian accent. Thats crazy!
1080,2022-11-20T09:11:58Z,I love it when youtubers show you nice beautiful side of other countries. It sure makes me want to travel the world. If only money wasn&#39;t a problem.
1081,2022-11-20T08:53:48Z,"Northen punjab india site, started oct to november the burned husk and paddy field for next crop.. wind brought smoke to punjab pakistan site.. it is not environmentally friendly habit to do!!!"
1082,2022-11-20T06:16:01Z,You left New Zealand for this???
1083,2022-11-20T03:47:46Z,150 is still a very poor average Karl!
1084,2022-11-20T00:48:21Z,India has insane pollution rates. So it&#39;s not really a misconception. Just because you may not see the smog/pollution all the time doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not still there.. I enjoy your content regardless but had to point this out.
1085,2022-11-20T00:42:10Z,Karl Rock: posts this videoNews Media: damnit he got us
1086,2022-11-19T23:11:01Z,I couldn’t live in the cities. The countryside is so beautiful.
1087,2022-11-19T17:49:36Z,finally somebdy said it
1088,2022-11-19T17:42:01Z,God that’s awful. India and Asia are destroying our planet
1089,2022-11-19T17:05:27Z,Pollution is all year round
1090,2022-11-19T15:49:53Z,Right knowledge
1091,2022-11-19T15:04:51Z,When they start wearing deodorant in the gym ill consider going to india
1092,2022-11-19T15:04:12Z,Obviously the villages have less pollution cuz there&#39;s no factories or cars lol. The cities are disgustingly polluted. And I&#39;m Indian so I know. Sorry Karl but this video is misinformation.
1093,2022-11-19T14:19:51Z,Anything that looks like fog in the afternoon that isnt. doesnt sound good anytime to me lol the last time i saw that here there was fires.
1094,2022-11-19T14:18:18Z,90% of Maharashtra has alot of fresh air and all greenery
1095,2022-11-19T13:51:47Z,The media always brainwashs ppl
1096,2022-11-19T13:45:33Z,I find it difficult to breathe in Indian cities. The same cannot be said for other international cities I have visited.
1097,2022-11-19T13:36:10Z,Come to uttarakhand
1098,2022-11-19T13:02:22Z,"The news is the most racist organization. All you hear is how bad it is in other countries. Crime ,economic issues,  pollution, etc. However you are correct its not like that at all. There are even nicer areas in India than here."
1099,2022-11-19T12:50:30Z,But the thing is crossing 150 in the pollution scale might ring major alarms in some countries. But it’s a normal day for us. Visually being OK doesn’t mean it’s actually OK to live in these cities
1100,2022-11-19T12:47:15Z,India is one of the world&#39;s leading top  polluting countries that&#39;s why
1101,2022-11-19T12:39:22Z,"God made the entire world habitable however people have been destroying what God provided. Generally speaking, India is dirty because of the people."
1102,2022-11-19T12:32:42Z,this guy can single handily carry india tourism
1103,2022-11-19T11:43:41Z,karl rock too many scammer india!!!! also more poclie frieghtee andmedis and national guards!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1104,2022-11-19T11:29:51Z,"Hey Karl. I hope you are well and safe! His holiness Pramukh swami lived a life full of compassion and love towards all and in remembrance of his life, an entire big festival is being held in Ahmedabad. It’s going to be a massive festival with lots of good food, amazing things to see and lots to learn and it’s going to be huge. You should definitely check it out if you have time."
1105,2022-11-19T11:23:43Z,Looks pretty smoggy to me. Even in smaller citys
1106,2022-11-19T11:17:08Z,That&#39;s so beautiful...
1107,2022-11-19T11:16:52Z,"Yeah it&#39;s fine outside of the North and cities, but if you go into the cities or in places like Delhi (even when pollution is supposedly low), if you&#39;re coming from a place where the air is clean you&#39;re doing real damage to your lungs. I can never go back to visit my family in Delhi because of this, I end up having throat issues and I cough for at least 2 weeks after I leave."
1108,2022-11-19T10:55:02Z,"Such a fan of you Karl ,I am so glad everything has worked well for you finally and I hope it will work well for you in the future too ,Also thanks for loving India And I beleive that you are Indian because you are really good to india and all . Wish you good luck !"
1109,2022-11-19T10:39:12Z,so it looks like that… just not all the time
1110,2022-11-19T10:15:32Z,And how much coal do they burn?
1111,2022-11-19T09:41:08Z,"Huge fan Karl, and I enjoyed my time in India, but even the later images showed pollution. It&#39;s sad."
1112,2022-11-19T09:22:55Z,I have to say that villages of India are too well maintained due to less population
1113,2022-11-19T09:17:29Z,I&#39;ve been to India several times at different times of the year and in different states and I&#39;m sorry to say the air was terribly polluted everywhere
1114,2022-11-19T08:59:43Z,Love to India From Pakistan
1115,2022-11-19T08:59:03Z,"Agree, my bf village (between gajsinghpur and padampur), foggy around this time, but before is clear and beautiful (dunno about exact clearness index bla2,i live in big city, already getting used bad air condition hahaha)."
1116,2022-11-19T08:56:46Z,The media always twist the truth and give you what they want you to see
1117,2022-11-19T08:39:50Z,&quot;the news&quot;
1118,2022-11-19T08:39:25Z,"Seems like the same goes with China, etc."

1120,2022-11-19T08:36:11Z,Breaking the misconceptions and myth all along. Good going Karl. Thank you!
1121,2022-11-19T08:34:37Z,Well that&#39;s not true Karl. Even if the air looks good that doesn&#39;t me it is. Go to any air pollution index sites and see how bad it is.
1122,2022-11-19T08:16:30Z,Thank you Karl for your efforts in correcting the misconceptions regarding India.
1123,2022-11-19T07:57:45Z,just check and see very unhealthy air quality in new dehli
1124,2022-11-19T07:40:26Z,"Yes. Visit Assam, not guwahati goto other districts take a train to tinsukia and visit devil&#39;s burger . CAUTION u may get addicted"
1125,2022-11-19T07:23:05Z,"Delhi - NCR is most polluted region in the country , i would not recommend a foreigner who likes to breathe fresh air coming to Delhi , they can visit Eastern and southern India , but if you tolerate the pollution plz come visit Delhi and try our food"

1142,2024-01-01T09:16:11Z,Please stop talking about Delhi air so much...talk about India air pollution. Stop talking about US air quality. Talk more about India.
1143,2024-01-01T08:00:20Z,"Please start talking about India&#39;s air pollution, not Dehli only. I am living in Indore and the air quality here has plummeted to unhealthy in three years. Yes, air quality changes constantly, but it is very bad most of the time for 9 months now in Indore."
1144,2023-12-03T22:10:38Z,What is India doing about waste disposal?? Why have you not invested in a proper sewage system??? Instead of buying so many new submarines from the French invest in the sanitation of fecal matter that plagues the country
1145,2023-12-02T04:26:26Z,India cant even manage air pollution and blaming other countries
1146,2023-11-30T17:48:28Z,No No No hotan in China is not polluted it has sand storms

1154,2023-11-15T02:06:31Z,I think this is the origin for pollution in China
1155,2023-11-14T04:49:28Z,Pollution and population is main problem. And government along with people are more responsible. Need to put more focus on public transportation.
1156,2023-11-10T10:00:40Z,"This is what happens when you have 1.4 billion people farting in one dense place. When i say over population is a problem,  they call me racist. Now, smell the farts and stfu."
1157,2023-11-10T08:11:07Z,"Double the price of petrol and diesel, increase public and green transportations within Delhi, create pay and use cycles and e bikes shops across the city, strictly govern the industries emissions not Justin Delhi but across its neighbouring states, collect the straw from the farmers after harvest and pay them for their straw, stop landfills from burning their wastes but rather create thermal powerplants that run on wastes as a form of fuel and treat the thermal powerplant emission before releasing.. ban all diesel vehicles, create public transport buses run on cng/ petrol/ electric, double the toll fee for cars with less than 3 passengers.."
1158,2023-11-10T07:12:28Z,"With rising pollution in Delhi and other cities, there is an increased risk of respiratory problems. I read a blog which covered the causes, consequences of pollution and also ways how to tackle pollution. You should have a read :"

1169,2023-11-07T07:33:55Z,"Delhi isn&#39;t a representation of all of India. People of Delhi and its neighbouring areas and states are the ones responsible for their own travesty. People in places like North-East, Karnataka or Uttarakhand breathe a better quality of air. Why should Delhi&#39;s problems be a cause of concern for the rest of India? Delhi or rather the centre, be it Congress BJP or AAP never took a keen interest in the rest of the country? Whether there&#39;s a flood in Assam or a cyclone in Odisha or drought in Tamil Nadu, the centre has never bothered. Population of Delhi never showed concern. Then why is Delhi&#39;s poor air quality a cause of concern for the rest of India?"
1170,2023-11-07T06:34:15Z,Who is to blame for the pollution in India  ? Why George Soros of course ! you have been blaming him for everything .

1174,2023-11-06T23:49:19Z,That we live in 2023 and people still baffled why governments wont fix the world is incredible. Its because they never had any intention since governments inserted their rule by deterrence over humanity. You&#39;re government wants you and all the majority of humans on Earth dead. Period.
1175,2023-11-06T16:45:58Z,Vehicles do a lot of pollution. We need to stop pollution
1176,2023-11-06T11:26:00Z,"In fact, air pollution is spreading from China to the world just like the novel coronavirus. If not, why was there basically no air pollution in the world before air pollution appeared in China? This is all caused by China. China must compensate India for its losses. Many people have died due to the new coronavirus in India, but China has not made any compensation."
1177,2023-11-06T08:43:46Z,"Need strong rules for population control and vehicle purchase rules (if you have parking then only u can purchase Peronal as well as Commercial) and stop over construction(in the name of urbanisation people city only concrete), none of the construction according to law  and who pass(officer) such construction and who construct must consider criminal and give such punishment which effect their children and family.. Many city are over crowded..."
1178,2023-11-06T08:05:22Z,Analysis is profound and insightful for many like me who is not aware of such issues. Air pollution disastrous as it affects imp respiratory system. Lot to be done in mitigating this health hazard at nation level also global level.
1179,2023-11-06T07:29:24Z,"&quot;Who is to blame?&quot;...... Answer is very easy, the people themselves. Can&#39;t blame the government for everything!"

1186,2023-11-05T19:08:40Z,"Delhi is suffering since last 6 years very heavily. Incapable and not man enough for a solution they amazingly blame Delhi citizens&#39; Diwali crackers as though Indians are not educated or knowing that its the fires&#39; smoke. Then blamed vehicles above 15 years that were eventually banned in Delhi, so brilliant, that car sales increased locally, but the smoke - its still there if not doubled.

After checking the map, it’s close to ladakh and Pakistan, does this mean that the pollution were transmitted from India and pakistan? Or is it the same issue with the crops?"

1192,2023-11-05T12:19:54Z,construction and demolition waste is the major reason of the air pollution in all the states.
1193,2023-11-05T09:22:38Z,"The hay left after the harvest of rice and wheat are good sources of compost to regenerate the soil. In the Philippines with the onset of mechanized rice harvesting, hays are left in the rice paddies and imbedded in the soil during tilling  and farmers found out that the fertility of the soil is enhanced which equates to less use of fertilizer. Maybe the farmers of India will benchmark on this practice if its effective and then replicate."
1194,2023-11-05T07:41:25Z,Atleast no.1 in pollution
1195,2023-11-05T07:24:40Z,Govt of Bharat should be blame for not taking serious action against the states who didn&#39;t take action against their farmers not to burn stubble. Stubble burning is the main cause.
1196,2023-11-05T06:22:10Z,"Why is Indian so concerned of China? Not a day we don&#39;t see Indians and India media talking about China. But I hardly see Chinese media and Chinese people talk about India. Inferiority complex and jealousy to see China is far ahead of India.

Its geopolitical importance is also growing amid a rapidly changing global order. India now has ambitions to become a global economic superpower. But there are serious question marks.

1198,2023-11-05T04:57:37Z,The Chinese bots watch Indian news because the Chinese government don’t allow them to watch what’s happening in China

The stench as soon as you cross DND stays with you till you are far away on the Eastern Peripheral Road.Indian media always cry crocodile tears about Delhi but Delhi is far better than the dump that is Noida in terms of air smell.

1200,2023-11-05T02:18:38Z,"Classic, deflects by saying other countries pollution are bad too lol.  Also the US and europe were due to forest fires. In the US, it was canada fires that cause the pollution.  Completely different than the industrial creation in India"
1201,2023-11-04T22:27:49Z,Palki. I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t put the blame. On china. Very surprised
1202,2023-11-04T20:34:05Z,"The pollution problem in India results from the same source as environmental problems everywhere else, poorly regulated development for PROFIT. Many democratic governments have been bought by the profits of business and technologies that could be raised against pollution are rejected by administrations that refuse to develop legislation to prevent exploitation that damages the environment and by extension damages citizens.Capitalism could go hand-in-hand with reasonable development BUT that affects short-term profits and so legislators are bought off to oppose regulation."
1203,2023-11-04T18:49:43Z,we have lost reverence for vaayu dev. we no longer respect air and wind. I propose more temples to bhoomi and vayu and Agni and Varuna. then people will start having some respect for the natural environment. Delhi is the ancient capital of indraprastha. yudishtira and Sri krishna would be horrified at what the city has become.

1211,2023-11-04T15:37:49Z,"Comparing the pollution levels in America and Europe to that of India is only comfortable to those who haven&#39;t seen both and do their own judgment. Indias problems have been there not just in Delhi but all over. The ground water pollution, garbage burning, leaf burning have been there since 80s. Though much has changed, what has really changed is access to information  has compounded. Pride in our nation is  a lot more than what it was in the 80s. A pride that was the domain of the doggedly patriotic has consumed much of the population. Thanks to better leadership, invention, education economy combined with a great respect India has earned abroad..But that shouldn&#39;t fool us in convincing ourselves, our problems are only slightly more than the America&#39;s and Europe&#39;s problems. It&#39;s exponentially more. It&#39;s a fact that was easier to digest a decade ago, but today with all that prejudice coming from rightfully earned pride, it&#39;s easier said than done. Let&#39;s get our heads down and get to work. We can&#39;t copy the west&#39;s way of becoming developed. Let&#39;s leave that experiment to China as I think it&#39;s pretty obvious its a failed model. But instead we need to address our problems our own way. I&#39;m no expert at all, but our built environment needs to be of indigenous materials, methods and  building science. We can&#39;t copy the west&#39;s model of concrete, rebar, insulation  and glazing. We can&#39;t produce and consume those materials in such proportions, not being able to recycle them at the same rate the west does. Ifs a problem in China and they don&#39;t realize it. Their state controlled media won&#39;t let them realize. They&#39;d made to beleive, they live a better life than the rest of the world. It&#39;s a long shot to change that behaviour. So let&#39;s not go there. Only example setting by India may change the course of this ecological disaster in Asia and Africa as our problems are more relatable. West had their problems and they will solve it by themselves. We need to solve ours. And good part is we are capable. More than what we or world thought we are capable of."

1225,2023-11-04T07:26:54Z,Showing Iran as Iraq! Speaks volumes on the quality
1226,2023-11-04T07:22:47Z,"In Delhi it is more than 70 to 80 % from parali ,,25 to 28% from construction or dust and only 2% from Diwali crackers but our countries islomo leftist says it is coz of fire crackers. What kind of dumb people these are."
1227,2023-11-04T07:21:12Z,Public : Who cannot control themselves from having more than one child.Govt : Which failed to implement one child policy 40 years back.Now situation out of control.Millions of hunger deaths can only fix this issue. Over population is the mother of all problems.Pollution is not just about vehicles. It&#39;s from industries which are for the humans.
1228,2023-11-04T07:02:22Z,"With record breaking pollution like this, no wonder all the educated and rich Indians prefer to leave India and move to a cleaner country. Not just for your own safety, but also for your family and future generations."
1229,2023-11-04T06:58:30Z,"All the countries have major air pollution problem but India is off the chart in this regard. More than 65 cities in top 100 is too much. I would understand major cities and industrial hubs to have high level of pollution but so many Indian flags covering the top 100 list is just unacceptable. No wonder many Indian choose to leave the country since the government has done little to address such important issue. Lives are at risk and sadly children living under these condition have high risk of terminal illness. This is at a time when India hasn&#39;t even become an export hub, which is a must to employee all the youths. Imagine the pollution if the government plan of becoming factory of the world comes true. The level of pollution will make India unlivable."
1230,2023-11-04T06:27:39Z,"It is a multi-faceted problem. My personal solution, if I were the minister, would be to tell the tractor  manufacturing companies to research and develop electric tractors. The main reason farmers burn the crops is because it costs too much fuel to simply use that particular machine that attaches behind the tractors that clears the fields and replant the Rabi crops. What do you guys think about my solution?"
1231,2023-11-04T04:25:38Z,Sad part is citizens don&#39;t care to hold govt accountable on pollution. They don&#39;t protest for stronger actions

1235,2023-11-04T02:07:34Z,"Have been waiting for this sort of news segment. Blame is secondary and can be put aside because when there is fire; first and foremost course of action is saving lives. I wish 1970s population control discussions would have not been jeopardized but let’s talk solutions (1) 1 child policy for all Indians irrespective of their religion, financial status etc(2) Switch back to non-fuel based local transport like manual rickshaws instead of fuel/battery powered ones to eliminate smoke and battery waste. Improve public transportation means. (3) Banning cigarettes- like New Zealand plans too.(4) Working with corporations to implement schedule to help minimize commute and mandating corporations to collaborate with either public mode of transport or run their buses to help reduce cars/scooters on road. Remote work days to be included whenever possible.(5) Similar to corporations- schools need to introduce remote learning days atleast twice a week; plus school buses for children and staff.(6) Degrowth- market clean up. Google it for more information. (7) For farmers - introducing and enabling management of organic matter left after yield. This is valuable matter anyways that should not be burned but should be recycled. (8) Plant more trees and encourage gardening even if at a small household level. Re-evaluate lifestyle choices to recommend healthy habits. Raise public awareness without which you cannot have public cooperation.Even if there was science to suck up all the smoke and excessive carbon, even then India’s population density is detrimental to its own public health and welfare and also to the planet health. No science can alter the above fact otherwise. Public should demand above measures and more as suggested by experts. Progress on the matter should be made transparent to the public and public participation should be mandated. What gets served on plate gets devalued - true for leadership and public responsibilities."

1253,2023-11-03T12:29:01Z,"Fixing Delhi&#39;s air pollution issue is a complex challenge that requires a multi-pronged approach. Some measures Delhi can take include:1. Improving public transportation: Expanding and enhancing the metro system, buses, and promoting non-motorized transport options can reduce the reliance on private vehicles.2. Implementing stricter emissions standards: Enforcing stringent emissions standards for vehicles and industries can help reduce pollution levels.3. Promoting electric vehicles: Encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles can significantly reduce vehicular emissions.4. Reducing industrial emissions: Enforcing pollution control measures in industries and relocating polluting industries away from residential areas can help.5. Managing construction and road dust: Implementing dust control measures at construction sites and on roads can reduce particulate matter in the air.6. Increasing green spaces: Promoting urban forestry, parks, and green building practices can improve air quality.7. Reducing crop burning: Addressing crop residue burning through incentives and technology can help mitigate seasonal air pollution.8. Public awareness and behavior change: Educating the public about the health impacts of air pollution and promoting responsible behavior can lead to positive changes.9. Monitoring and data transparency: Implementing robust air quality monitoring systems and making data publicly available can help track progress.10. Regional cooperation: Collaborating with neighboring states to address shared sources of pollution, such as stubble burning, is essential.These measures need to be implemented comprehensively and in a sustained manner, and public support and participation are crucial for their success."

The same farmers, thanks to whom we have food on our plates, are also k!lling us slowly. Enough with the appeasement politics. We, the humans of delhi, deserve a better quality of life. Kejriwal understood the problem when he didn’t have govt in Punjab, so what’s stopping him now to bring in effective laws to nip the issue in the bud, now that he does have a govt there?"

Nothing can be done in this case as people dont want to do anything. Governments cant take strict action becaus3 of the vote bank. But at the end we are destroying our nation. Its every year we crib about it but nothing happens and nothing will happen. You will get your views and people will blabber and then back on BAU. We should learn from Japanese people they love their country, I have not seen a cleaner nation than Japan."

1380,2023-11-02T23:04:19Z,"I notice most people of India blame politicians and leaders for this plight. But, fail to look at themselves in the mirror of the ancient traditions, totally unhealthy habits, misuse of fire to eliminate, and supposedly &quot;purify&quot; their habitat. This uncivilized nonesense is evident only in the eyes of a relative few. Have Indians asked themselves what is the main reason people avoid visiting large cities of India? Public filth and putrid toxic odors that prevail."
1381,2023-11-02T22:58:50Z,i thought palki will also blame china for pollution in india and mass pro palestine protest in india

1390,2023-11-02T21:32:54Z,Why does the Indian government allow all this polution ?
1391,2023-11-02T21:26:50Z,There is an immediate need to make really harse laws to curb this problem across India by the govt. If proactive action is not taken then nothing will improve ever. Few suggestions1. India should invest in installating machines that can assist in cleaning air in cities where air quality is poor.2. Complete blanket ban on polluting vehicles bharat stage 3 and 4 across india.3. Ban on fireworks causing pollution during diwali across india.4. Strict guidelines on contruction. For eg. like covering the contruction site with something that prevents dust from spreading across sheet etc5. Burning agriculture land should be completely banned along punitive actions against culprits. Annoucement for this shoud directly come from PM. Farmers should be sensitized against this practice. Drones should be utilized to monitor areas in initial years for compliance.6. Strict action/harsh laws and guidelines against companies causing air pollution.
1392,2023-11-02T21:22:16Z,i am shock palki will report this
1393,2023-11-02T21:08:54Z,Govt is only doing some cleanup whenever delhi is hosting international events like large conventions and commonwealth games
1394,2023-11-02T20:50:35Z,"Okay Its someone I can&#39;t mention , and I know I am telling you this is just left out here no matter who reads or who don&#39;t but it is the Industries that shifted to neighboring areas to New Delhi and are still able to close proximity , In these Industries the pollution is leaked out to open at night intentionally and all the governmental and Non governmental pollution measuring methods are given ample amount of money to shut the mouths , I will not mention individual level but I know a every sweeper to every minister is having money accordingly ."
1395,2023-11-02T20:47:11Z,India has lots of billionaires. India has very educated people. Yet even the billionaires breathes the same air. Money can’t buy clean air.

1408,2023-11-02T19:15:35Z,Obviously Punjab and Haryana.  The previous govt haven’t been able to resolve a genuine environmental issue and then the entire opposition brigade along with so called enlightened radical left illiberals try to pin it on the Hindu Diwali Festival.
1409,2023-11-02T19:14:45Z,"don&#39;t tell lies please, the air quality in China is not yet ideal but way better than 10 years ago, it has greatly improved over the past decade due to a much more tightened environmental law and implementation. I am not saying China&#39;s air is there yet, it still has a long way to go, but telling lies saying the air quality is worsening in China to make India feel less bad about its air quality is pathetic."

1413,2023-11-02T19:02:45Z,Thanks for the report. First Post rarely talks about there own issues. America has issues too. States vary in how clean they want to be. Federal standards...and then there&#39;s the State.  Two agencies looking at your business. EPA. Environmental Protection Agency!   Like Godzilla!  There Real!  Smog Monster has no chance to breath.  But they do step on people!

1416,2023-11-02T18:55:10Z,Palki delivery is spot on as usual and it is good the media is highlighting this. Modi and leaders in India  do something critical about this
1417,2023-11-02T18:54:28Z,India has modern equipment...like America in its industrial phase. Several factors. Even London went through its KILLER SMOG!  Indeed....my favorite Godzilla movie is VS The Smog Monster.  A creature of PURE POLLUTION!  It took.... People to change there...Power Plants. There industrial waste. Landfills.  I mean REAL.... landfills. Not Piled Garbage!  In fact the highest elevation in many states....in flat areas. Are the landfill sites.  Mostly Dirt. Understand?  Breaks down garbage...but only if you haul it there....burn some... recycle some... bury most. This too has issues...not perfect. But hazardous waste needs to be separated..and even nuclear waste is usually kept in a salt mine...so even if an earthquake happens...its simply sealed. There are literally mountains of salt....many mines.  Garbage Pick up! Just as Vital.   How on Earth can it be done?  TAXES!  TAXES!  TAXES!  Regulations. Over sight. And even then...you get. &quot;Love Canal&quot;. A whole community built around.......a toxic waste dump. That nobody talked about.  Understand? America documents its mistakes...most countries dont even admit such things. Especially Russia or China.  And Burning your fields?  Is very old school... We plow it under...your wasting it!  Compost.  Smoke Stacks! The Smog Monster...would take big smoky hits off the smoke stacks of the factorys....to Heal and get Bigger. So.....We have scrubbers...and various regulations to monitor air quality. Its all very expensive you know.....but worth it.  I don&#39;t know if a plow would work for agriculture needs....but i see you still use a cow.  Our modern family...is on our farms too. For cattle .chickens..need clean water. And everything....is inspected. FDA approved. Or its not sold. Farmers markets differ of course..but there out in the rual areas.  City&#39;s can&#39;t really be having cattle and pigs .  Sanitation. For there benefit....and the people. Most garbage is picked up.... weekly.  Nobody using the river....to bath in. Or go to the bathroom. India has a long way to go.  But your getting there. More trade.. more money. More investment. Better technology... shared in the City and rual farms.  Sanitation!  Composting. Disposal. Clean water. TAXES!  And over sight.

Bcs from October End to February we suffer from Winter (which is okay) but we suffer from Bad Air Quality, and From May to September we face severe heat problems ..its unbearable to live here ..Me and My Family will soon leave this sick Capital City .. in 2025 ..will move on to our Hometown Kerala atleast AQI is way better than here .. In Delhi only March and April is Fine .. Not so cold and not so hot !! AQI also gets better .. But From May the actual Summer starts and in June It increases to 45°C which feels like 54°C .. In July - August we have some relief due to Rain but humidity gets worse ..Road Blockage everywhere..due to heavy rain !! And In September again Hot weather ..that too extreme .. And when October starts we get some relief ..but Surprise Surprise..here comes to Pollution .. to choke us .. .. Its Like Delhi is a cursed place ..Weathers are Extreme here .. Conditions are pathetic !! People are rude, vulgar !! Although Delhi is having one of the best Metro Connection in the World !! But Still its bad !! No wonder why Britishers at that time came to Delhi only during the Winters .. Once we move out from this Pathetic City !! .. No matter even if the Situation gets better here .. we will never come back here .. Delhi = Tatti It&#39;s like Somebody has cursed this Delhi so badly that it will never be good !! ..Sabse Ghatiya jagah toh East Delhi hai .."

1453,2024-11-19T09:21:35Z,"The Silent Threat of Air Pollution and the Power of Wearable Air Purifier MasksAir pollution is an invisible enemy, posing severe risks to our health every day. From fine particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) to harmful gases like carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, the air we breathe often carries toxic elements that can lead to respiratory issues, allergies, asthma, cardiovascular diseases, and even long-term conditions like lung cancer. Prolonged exposure to polluted air is especially harmful to children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions.In such challenging times, protecting yourself is not just a choice—it’s a necessity. This is where Wearable Air Purifier Masks, like the Smart Wearable Air Purifier Mask – Purimask, come into play. These masks are more than just a face covering; they combine advanced filtration technology to filter out harmful pollutants while allowing you to breathe clean and safe air, no matter where you are.Designed for comfort and efficiency, a wearable air purifier mask not only guards against harmful pollutants but also reduces your risk of exposure to allergens and airborne bacteria. It&#39;s an essential tool for daily commutes, outdoor activities, and even indoor environments where air quality may be compromised.Investing in a Wearable Air Purifier Mask is investing in your health. Protect your lungs, safeguard your family, and breathe easy in a world where clean air is becoming increasingly scarce.Stay safe, breathe clean, and take a step toward a healthier future.For more details about Purimask, visit:  the demo:  us now to book your order: Call/WhatsApp: +91-9335154556 / +91-8176080204"

1456,2024-11-18T16:50:53Z,Man isn’t it funny how the government’s actions in these situations is to ask the people to do better while the government goes ahead not really taking a proactive action to solve the problem. The people will also go ahead to accept this as the fact of life no matter how much impact this will have on people’s health. It’s like like the Indian citizens living in that area will accept whatever fate is given to them which is really funny. Like sure everyone agrees that there are problems but no one will get out of their house and actually protest to get what they want. No wonder British was able to colonize India so easily.

Well, it’s not farmers fault, in countries like USA, UK or Europe they also do farming but they have better technique to get rid of leftover wastes stubble but here in India the burning is done. So government must adopt immediately techniques for that. And please don’t blame the farmers. Farmers are the people who work in hot Sun 100 degree weather to grow wheat and rice and that’s the reason we are able to feed ourselves. So please respect farmers. Stop blame game"

1491,2024-10-28T19:17:49Z,AAP govt in Delhi knows nothing except blaming things. The main reason behind this pollution is over-population of the city and their waste. The huge population using cars and bikes also does air pollution. Another reason is environment non-friendly policies which doesn&#39;t stop pollution from industries. Huge population burning firecrackers is also a problem.

1557,2024-10-23T17:47:17Z,"Stubble burning and other human factors are minor - the real reason is Delhi’s location - in the summer months, the southwest monsoon pushes the desert sands towards Delhi and environs and they are then trapped by the mountainous terrain around.

No new businesses should be allowed to be set up in the entire region, including Gurugram and Noida."

1572,2024-10-23T15:33:35Z,"any people are rushing to purchase apartments and lands paying crores in NCR where it lacks even basic necessities like clean water and clean air, govt. is already getting a lot of revenue so they don&#39;t need to care about the public."
1573,2024-10-23T15:25:22Z,Get ready Banglore
1574,2024-10-23T15:16:01Z,Here we go again.

1578,2024-10-23T14:57:44Z,Thank goodness im in Chennai with coastal air circulation
1579,2024-10-23T14:56:50Z,Its not about diwali its about this time period in general when they burn those agricultural waste.    Diwali does cause air pollution atleast if play it hard enough like here in patna but it only last for about 1 to 2 days only.  Afterwards everything becomes normal
1580,2024-10-23T14:49:03Z,Where are the anti-smog chambers?
1581,2024-10-23T14:47:56Z,Hindutva Sanghis are going to ruin it during Diwali and proudly violate the law against Chinese invention firecrackers.
1582,2024-10-23T14:44:52Z,The capital should have been changed before the making of the new parliament. Every non Indian land in Delhi and get overwhelmed with that city. Recently the English vlogger travelled Delhi I felt humiliated even sitting here in UP. That city in any sense is not fit for being a capital city. Indian governments over the years should have made cities like Chandigarh but here we are.
1583,2024-10-23T14:38:50Z,ive noticed this thing that whole year these kind of youtubers dont say anything about air polution but during diwali season where many burst crackers why suddenly wake up and make video about air pollution ..
1584,2024-10-23T14:34:53Z,"Thank god, I live in one of the best cities"
1585,2024-10-23T14:34:29Z,should we really need those crackers

As a Delhi resident, I&#39;m grateful that you&#39;re helping raise awareness about our situation. Please keep watching and sharing updates about Delhi&#39;s air - your international voice helps highlight this serious issue.  We need more channels like you who care about Delhi&#39;s air pollution problem."
1597,2024-11-18T04:23:14Z,Why not they close firecrackers factories and ban sales.
1598,2024-11-18T04:21:34Z,Why burn paddy when they have machines to convert into fertilizer?
1599,2024-11-15T04:32:18Z,Propoganda Channel blaming Diwali which was last month DW has always been racist and anti india
1600,2024-11-13T07:00:15Z,Diwali or other festivities with fireworks  might be minute contributors but actual monster culprit of smog in Pakistan and India is the paddy stubble burning !
1601,2024-11-12T14:17:46Z,Lahore and delhi ate same now
1602,2024-11-07T10:33:08Z,DW News your Channel is going to close soon. Germany is sinking.
1603,2024-11-06T15:02:42Z,"Victory of LIGHT over DARK! By shrouding the city in toxic, light blocking smog"
1604,2024-11-04T06:11:56Z,stop this nonsense
1605,2024-11-04T01:15:43Z,"I’m neither Chinese nor Indian. But anyone saying the Indian economy is going to overtake the Chinese long term is fooling themselves. India may have the larger population, but China has both the numbers and the smarts to create an insanely productive nation at scale. While I love Indian culture, there are many aspects of it that will handicap it in terms of trying to achieve the same levels of quality and output. China isn’t perfect but this is a problem they would likely resolve rapidly, and partly via technology, while I have the feeling that India will be brought to the brink of a waste disaster as they attempt to increase their growth rate."
1606,2024-11-03T23:06:42Z,"AAP, BJP and Congress have no plans to curb pollution. They just aim for short term electoral gains !"
1607,2024-11-03T05:45:21Z,"Like previous years everything will fall in it&#39;s place , dont worry. Life keeps going and so time."
1608,2024-11-03T03:03:08Z,What’s new?
1609,2024-11-02T21:05:02Z,"I have been to Delhi. What a dump, literally."
1610,2024-11-02T20:27:56Z,"So what is the problem, It&#39;s sign of development LoL during construction of a building(nation) there is only dust of concrete"
1611,2024-11-02T19:58:39Z,Well all those future canadians better get out of there before the tech bubble crashes!
1612,2024-11-02T18:57:09Z,"everyone in the world use fire crackers and people will on new year , but  always blame Diwali for it"
1613,2024-11-02T18:13:30Z,That is what the collective flatulence of 30 million vegetarians looks like.
1614,2024-11-02T17:57:08Z,Poisoned by all that cheap russian oil
1615,2024-11-02T15:57:21Z,"Looks like a biased report, it&#39;s a well known fact that stuble burning in the neighbouring states cause this pollution every year"
1616,2024-11-02T15:26:15Z,celebrate prosperity by burning things which remove people&#39;s ability to breathe.... not smart is it
1617,2024-11-02T15:05:17Z,Field burning must be banned. And all vehicles made electric. And fireworks banned.
1618,2024-11-02T14:54:24Z,Hinduism is responsible for this
1619,2024-11-02T14:50:06Z,Cows are wandering where those who worship cows.Rivers are polluting where those who worship rivers .Air polluting where those who worship air god
1620,2024-11-02T14:49:23Z,They still breed so much?
1621,2024-11-02T14:37:03Z,World polluted people&#39;s are Kerala and north Indian people&#39;s
1622,2024-11-02T13:48:40Z,they need clean people and clean food first.
1623,2024-11-02T12:20:53Z,"Same old rant linking everything negative to hindu biggest festivals... meanwhile &quot;farmers&quot; keep on burning fields . Tired of this nonsense reportage. Anyways nobody cares in india. If government were so concerned they also live in Delhi PRESIDENT PM, CHEIF JUSTICE, CM, LG, MINISTRIES. They would have taken concrete actions but they don&#39;t. Meanwhile India is not only Delhi it&#39;s a big a country... surely Delhi air is polluted but what a common man can do if governments themselves are not interested but linking with HINDU FESTIVAL is INSIDIOUS REPORTAGE."
1624,2024-11-02T11:59:33Z,It is a shame that Modi is too involved in playing politics rather than improving the lives of the people in India so they can celebrate holidays like Diwali.
1625,2024-11-02T11:33:48Z,"AQI in Anand Vihar, Delhi was 724 on 15 Oct which was much before Diwali. Yes firecrackers pollute the air but just in very short term."
1626,2024-11-02T11:01:36Z,Bet you some politician will be blaming that this smog is due to climate change
1627,2024-11-02T10:46:08Z,India superpower by 2020
1628,2024-11-02T10:06:41Z,Everything is dusty in India
1629,2024-11-02T09:44:05Z,"There is a study available by NEERI n CSE... suggest u give it a look n report again on issue, instead of a predictable/generalized/run of the mill point of view on expected lines....it is a problem, true.However, the malice lies elsewhere than Diwali firecrackers/crop burning."
1630,2024-11-02T09:41:48Z,I&#39;m confident India would solve air problem in 5 years.  Since corrupt CCP spent 10 year
1631,2024-11-02T09:34:10Z,Irony is that ..Family and neighbours of judge who gave the order to ban the firecrackers was bursting it infront of him ….due to fear of his wife he is silent ..
1632,2024-11-02T09:32:28Z,"Oof imagine, you&#39;re taking a dump by the road and you have to breath in this smog"
1633,2024-11-02T09:00:44Z,Only two persons responsible for that 2 modi 2 kejribwal both are thinking only vote at any cost they have no pain for people’s of Delhi and the whole countryYes it’s true very much
1634,2024-11-02T08:51:37Z,Not the first time nor the last.
1635,2024-11-02T08:44:49Z,Indians enjoy democracy while Chinese enjoy breathing clean air and seeing blue skys.
1636,2024-11-02T08:12:12Z,So this concerned the EU
1637,2024-11-02T08:10:30Z,"We&#39;ve poisoned the air, water and soil as well as wiped out forests, flattened mountains and hollowed out the earth not only in India but almost everywhere in the name of development. Words are really misleading. I say this is not &quot; development &quot; but  long term annihilation for short term wealth and power. Some  people say that this could also be an attempt to banish a sense of lack of internal peace through external accumulation. Be that as it may, humans have to face the dilemma of endless economic growth in the context of limited resources that mother earth has and its ability to sustain our unmindful and wasteful behavior."
1638,2024-11-02T07:57:29Z,"Remember I was unable to see the sun in the polluted Delhi. Often couldn’t see further than 25 metres.People still defecate on the streets.It’s a different planet, thousands of years behind our civilized planet."
1639,2024-11-02T07:55:41Z,"Fireworks are really not the cause of this but a way to blame the population, and you know as a journalist it will continue because they blame the holidays.... it is big companies like factories and other things that are to blame for this, even a child know it. Companies use the country as an irresponsible waste site and it is the population that pays the penalty"
1640,2024-11-02T07:50:31Z,There is no regard/ respect for human life/ human rights in India.
1641,2024-11-02T07:48:55Z,Stop blaming everything on diwali or cars. Dhelli has always worse air due to crop Bruning.
1642,2024-11-02T07:44:27Z,India needs clean electricity and transportation quickly. Chinese cities have become so much cleaner in just 5 years.
1643,2024-11-02T07:38:24Z,What a absurd comparison  delhi has pollution even before diwali and it’s mainly because of if paddy feild burning
1644,2024-11-02T07:33:03Z,FU!! Check pollution of other countries and there and over hundred who are equally worst! On purpose don&#39;t single out India! DW you are turning to be another BBC!!
1645,2024-11-02T07:30:34Z,they pollute and they have to blame only themsleves for this toxicity
1646,2024-11-02T07:29:39Z,"Wait, fireworks compared to uncontrolled field burning??? I&#39;m very skeptical, to say the least."
1647,2025-02-05T12:41:09Z,Fk this let China occupy us
1648,2025-01-25T07:52:53Z,"Wish i could live in japan , i know they have lot of problems too but who cares at least it’s clean , disciplined, public transportation is robust like top class and if you wana go near by people just walk or use bicycle . If I trying going by bicycle here in india someone probably gona run over me ."

1674,2024-12-05T06:05:37Z,1. Better tracking of farm fires.2. Using an alternative to stubble burning. Eg - Pusha decomposer.3. Encouraging the purchase of an electronic vehicle.4. Covering construction material and site ( suggested by IIT KANPUR ). 5. Spending on filtration technology.

Then monitoring for a year to see if Delhi is able to reduce its pollution!When I visited Delhi fourteen years ago, the first thing I did when I arrived was to get out as quickly as possible, it was totally unbreathable.

Not only Departments, but Sections of Departments could be dispersed across the country and regions, reducing the pressure on communities and infrastructure and localising regulation.

Just the cessation of stubble burning would be an enormous improvement two fold - to not trap pollutants already occurring in Delhi, and to not add pollutants to the air. However, it&#39;s also the cheapest, simplest method to fertilize fields and remove stalks; and the most habit engrained process for doing so. I haven&#39;t see the decomposing tech before, or considered the enormous effect covering construction sites would have on air quality. Appreciate these being brought to the fore. Cheers."

1834,2024-11-21T12:33:23Z,"What people don&#39;t understand is that while stubble fires are a very key cause (second highest contributors), thermal power plants such as coal are actually the primary factors why there is so much pollution and AQI degradation. But due to heavy business lobbying, the mainstream media doesn&#39;t highlight this. Promoting and using more EVs will only cause this issue to further rise in the long run.Additionally, shutting a majority of these coal plants or moving them to better areas while simultaneously upgrading the technology of the existing plants to run more efficiently and creating mechanisms to filter/trap the emissions at the source itself is what is going to bring change.Lastly, we should gradually be moving towards renewable energy sources such as Wind and Solar to meet our power generation requirements."

The man is also responsbile for such pollution level in Delhi. But instead of being sent in Jail such criminal act, he is running Delhi! Everywhere we have dirty politicians who have converted this country into hell. Climate change will destroy India in just in few years, not even 10 years...but none is talking about it, none taking it seriously..every year lakhs of trees from forest areas are being chopped on the name of development...Uttarkhand and Himachal like sensitive Himalayan zones have seen worst kind of destruction of mountains and forests..Due to this rain patterns have changed drastically where shorter and heavy rains are happening causing massive destrcutions and water shortage..everyyear North West India water shortage is increasing, while months and days os snofall have reduced drastically. By now Uttakhand and HImachal would witness at least two spells of Snowfall in their mid Himalayan peaks...none has happened..no rain. This year July August in HImachal and UK were blowing hot air like May of Delhi. Uttarakhand, they chopped Corbet National Park and raised building there.

1858,2024-11-21T06:13:36Z,"As Delhi is choking under toxic air, with AQI (Air Quality Index) hovering around “severe” category (401-500); touching 494 mark on Monday, making it the world’s most polluted capital city, let us try to understand the measures that should be taken to address the issue. The country&#39;s capital getting engulfed in thick smog during winter year after year, is not only detrimental to public health, but also impacting India’s reputation on the global stage. First, let us see the solutions discussed by the anchor:  i) Better tracking of farm fires; ii) using alternatives to stubble burning; iii) encouraging purchase and use of EVs as well as hybrid vehicles; iv) covering dust-generating construction materials and demolition sites; v) spending more on new and filtering technologies; vi) full utilization of central govt’s fund allotted for “National Clean Air Programme”.“Cleaning Delhi’s air - and that of other Indian cities – requires all-year-round action”, with proper planning, monitoring, and related investment. Infact, it should be a focal point in govt’s agenda and part of policy-making. To combat the issue of soaring air pollution, concerned authorities should find out solutions which have a “long-term, sustainable approach based on science”, along with preventive measures. According to experts, the following actions should be taken to address the burning issue of air pollution: i) use of cleaner modes of commuting; ii) increased use of public transport; iii) greater scrutiny over industrial emissions; iv) incentivise households to transition to green cooking fuels; v) curb on use of coals in hotels; vi) initiate artificial rains; vii) increasing use of BS VI vehicles, as well as, use of the more refined BS VI fuel in BS IV vehicles (as far as practicable); viii) use of water spray and initiating more plantation drives; ix) promote the use of bicycles, and if possible, create separate tracks for that, etc.This recurring problem could not only become an election issue in the upcoming Delhi Assembly polls, but should be raised in the parliament as well.   As India is planning to host COP 33 (Conference of Parties) Climate Summit in 2028, resolving the capital’s air pollution problem should be a top priority, and needs comprehensive and concerted efforts from both the Delhi government and the Centre."

Here farmers are treated with kid gloves by all political parties and no one dare point fingers at farmers  burning it. Each year MSP for paddy is increased, thus more farmers sow Rice and thus more burning of residue in fields each year .

1997,2024-11-20T07:42:31Z,"Instead of burning wheat stubble, American farmers use several alternative methods to manage it effectively:No-Till Farming: This method involves leaving the stubble on the field and planting the next crop directly into the residue. It helps improve soil health by reducing erosion, increasing water retention, and enhancing soil organic matter.Tillage: Some farmers choose to till the soil, which involves breaking up and mixing the stubble into the soil. This can help control weeds and prepare the soil for the next crop, but it can also lead to soil erosion and loss of organic matter.Mowing: Mowing the stubble can reduce weed seed production and make the field more manageable. This method is often used in combination with other practices.Herbicides: Farmers may use herbicides to control weeds in wheat stubble fields. This can be an effective way to manage weed growth without disturbing the soil.Cover Crops: Planting cover crops, such as legumes or grasses, can help improve soil health, reduce erosion, and suppress weeds.Baling: Some farmers bale the stubble and sell it as livestock feed or use it for bedding material.Composting: Composting the stubble can create valuable organic matter that can be used to improve soil fertility.Bio-Enzymes: Some farmers use bio-enzymes to decompose the stubble, turning it into manure and improving soil quality.Each method has its benefits and drawbacks, and the choice often depends on the specific conditions of the farm and the goals of the farmer."

As if polluted air wasn&#39;t enough !!!Also, huge amount of risk involved in artificial rain.

2077,2024-11-20T04:18:00Z,What&#39;s central government is doing about it
2078,2024-11-20T04:16:10Z,"It is overly simplistic to hold the Delhi government solely accountable for the city’s persistent pollution crisis. While I am not an advocate for the AAP government, it is important to acknowledge that pollution in Delhi is intricately tied to contributions from neighboring cities such as Noida, Gurgaon, Faridabad, and Ghaziabad. These regions, with their sprawling industrial estates, vehicular emissions, and thermal power plants, play a significant role in exacerbating Delhi’s environmental woes.The Delhi government lacks jurisdiction over these areas, and without active cooperation and accountability from the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, any meaningful resolution remains elusive. Instead of addressing the root causes collaboratively, the blame game continues unabated, leaving Delhi and the wider NCR region to bear the brunt of deteriorating air and water quality. This stalemate ensures that the crisis persists, as political expediency triumphs over collective responsibility."
2079,2024-11-20T04:13:38Z,"Ahh no, quit messing with weather! The USA already screwing the planet beyond repair!"
2080,2024-11-20T04:07:23Z,"Poor reporting. Ncap targetted 2024 to reduce polution. Vehicles emit 40% pollution. SUVs apone emits 13% , not a single word on that, maybe because she herself uses one."

2083,2024-11-20T04:05:54Z,The only solution is to leave this pathetic country and settle in some other country. There is no hope of any improvement.
2084,2024-11-20T04:04:55Z,"Yes move to Gurugram, Faridabad, Noida or Lucknow. Madam is right, Delhi government is incompetent. The surrounding states have much better air quality"

Jai shree Putin!
2086,2024-11-20T04:03:27Z,Vehicles is 40% source of Delhi&#39;s pollution. What about Gurugram? It doesn&#39;t face stubble burning and those winds. Stubble doesn&#39;t get burn in December but pollution still persists.
2087,2024-11-20T04:03:07Z,"Why Staying in India Feels HopelessIndia, a country that once seemed full of promise, now feels like a place where dreams come to die. Every day, millions of us wake up hoping for change, but instead, we’re met with the same chaos, broken systems, and empty promises. It’s heartbreaking, but for many, the only real solution is to leave. Here’s why staying feels unbearable:1. Politics: The political scene is a disaster. Corruption runs deep, and leaders care more about their vote banks than the people they’re supposed to serve. They talk about progress, but where is it? All we get are excuses and blame-shifting, while real issues—our issues—are ignored.2. Education: Our education system is failing us. Schools and colleges don’t prepare us for the real world; they train us to cram, pass exams, and then struggle to find relevance in a competitive global market. Parents sacrifice everything for their children’s education, only for them to realize they need to leave the country to truly succeed.3. Jobs: Where are the jobs? Even after years of education and hard work, so many of us are stuck in underpaying or unstable roles. It’s disheartening to watch talent and ambition go to waste while nepotism and favoritism thrive.4. Infrastructure: Roads full of potholes, constant power cuts, and cities choking on traffic. This isn’t progress—it’s survival. And if you’re in rural India, good luck finding even the most basic infrastructure.5. Healthcare: Getting sick in India is a gamble with your life. Public hospitals are overcrowded and poorly managed, while private healthcare is so expensive it can ruin families. What’s worse is seeing politicians flying abroad for treatment while we’re left to fend for ourselves.6. Society: Our people can be kind, but society often feels like a trap. We’re constantly judged—by our neighbors, extended families, even strangers. There’s no room for individuality, no space to live freely without someone dictating how we should behave.7. Air Quality: Breathing has become a health risk in most cities. The government talks about sustainability, but where’s the action? Children grow up inhaling poison, and we’re told to accept this as normal.8. Taxes: We work hard, we pay our taxes, and yet we see nothing in return. Where does all the money go? It’s infuriating to contribute so much and still live without proper roads, clean water, or quality public services.9. Quality of Life: Life here feels like an endless grind. We work tirelessly but rarely feel like we’re truly living. There’s no time to relax, no space to breathe, and no sense of security for the future.10. Future Outlook: And speaking of the future—what hope is there? Inflation keeps rising, opportunities keep shrinking, and the country feels like it’s on a downward spiral. If this is today, what will tomorrow look like?More Reasons to Leave11. Corruption: From the smallest government office to the highest levels of power, corruption is everywhere. It’s exhausting to fight a system that seems designed to exploit us at every turn.12. Public Safety: Crime is rising, and justice is painfully slow. Women are unsafe, children are unsafe, and even speaking out against the system feels dangerous. How can we live like this?13. Environmental Neglect: Look at our rivers, our forests—they’re being destroyed in the name of &quot;development.&quot; The environment isn’t just being ignored; it’s being sacrificed for profits and PR stunts.14. Freedom of Speech: Try expressing your opinions, and you’re immediately attacked—either online or in real life. Criticizing the government or questioning the system has become a risky endeavor.15. Talent Waste: So many bright, talented people have no choice but to leave. It’s painful to watch our best minds—our friends, our family—move abroad because they know their potential will never be valued here.16. Urban Chaos: Our cities are overcrowded, filthy, and collapsing under their own weight. Every day feels like a battle just to get through the traffic, the pollution, and the lack of basic services.17. Global Image vs. Reality: The world is shown a shiny, polished version of India, but we know the truth. We live it every day—the struggles, the injustices, the broken promises.The truth is, we’ve given so much to this country, and what have we gotten in return? Broken dreams, constant struggles, and a future that feels even worse than the present. Staying here feels like being stuck in quicksand—no matter how hard we try, we’re only sinking deeper.For those who can leave, it’s not about abandoning India—it’s about saving ourselves. Moving out isn’t just an opportunity; it’s a chance to finally live, to breathe, and to build a life where we’re valued, supported, and free."

2092,2024-11-20T03:47:10Z,Discussing with my mother we got an idea if any of you can add anything please do.&quot;Farmers should be provided with token for stubble collection for the amount of crop they can sell at msp. &quot;Means only farmer who provide stubble and not burn it will be able to sell at msp prices at govt. Centre. ...Or make it mandatory to sell stubble at the same counter where they sell grains at msp.Making stubble collection mandatory. So companies and buy stubble for raw material in furniture and other renewable methods.
2093,2024-11-20T03:46:54Z,I saw people blaming cars buses and politicians but nobody asked why Punjab farmers &amp; others near the capital region are smartly burning stubbles to avoid detection. Do whatever if these stupid rich farmers don&#39;t stop nothing gonna change

To completely Ban burning of residues of Agriculture waste by neighbouring states.5. To fix a population cap limit.6. To fix a vehicle Registration cap limit.7. To scrap old vehicles.8. To follow strict industrial pollution outlet norms.9. Government should promote Eco- Friendly materials.10. Building artificial Nest for Birds and planting trees such as Neem , Banyan. Mahogany.( Neem - A air purifier  tree).11. To study reports about different countries and to formulate a solution how they got rectified from it. Increase forest cover.12.

2108,2024-11-20T03:04:02Z,What about planting trees? Nobody suggested it as a solution.
2109,2024-11-20T03:03:46Z,"Unfortunately and sadly enough, next year and so on as well, we would keep seeing such videos with some real good suggestions,but no real practical solutions being done by our sinisters (was supposed to be read ministers)"
2110,2024-11-20T03:02:03Z,"Aside from stubble burning. We should plant more trees in Delhi alongside roads even if it does not do anything, beautification.Also like madam mentioned Delhi should not have open construction. Supreme Court should pass some verdict that construction anywhere in the country should be done with covers. No uncovered material should move around. Cover it Also what happened to that planting green tree belt that will stop dust from Middle East in into India??? What happened??? And what is the solution to this dusty India??"

Delhi AQI is over 200 almost whole year (just not in monsoon).. in winters, wind stops, low pressure zone is created over Delhi.. and biggest reasons are Industrial pollution via chimneys(no filteration), Delhis vehicular pollution nd in this wedding season, traffic management is way too bad, and then comes the construction dust!!"

Jokes, aside I don&#39;t remember any projects related to Drainage, Transportation &amp; Yamuna cleaning projects in the last decade. Almost all Delhi CNG buses are in a very poor situation &amp; taking last breath. Yamuna is so so dirty just look at Ahmedabad Sabarmati.

They rather announce some new factory or new weapon system. Pollution is long term and doesn&#39;t buy votes. That&#39;s why people of means are leaving India. They can live at least 10 years longer by moving to Canada and so will their kids.

2173,2024-11-19T21:07:25Z,"I&#39;m very surprised that appropriate waste management was not included as a solution in this video. Delhi has a waste mountain and the consistent but inappropriate dumping/burning of waste releases harmful substances in the air leading to air pollution and also poses huge risks to H&amp;S of the public. The other big solution is strict checks of car&#39;s pollution tests. Conversion to EVs etc are dreamy solutions which take time as not every person can just ditch their petrol/diesel car and invest lacs on a car just due to air pollution. We need to think what&#39;s feasible and what&#39;s right in front of our eyes i.e., waste management, world-class public transport (Metros &amp; RRTS), strict checks on automobiles especially freight vehicles etc. Absolutely agree with regulation within construction industry!"

The cost of manufacture, mining, maintenance and production of more electricity through coal to charge the vehicles is gonna be worse than this. This is a stubble burning issue as far as Delhi NCR is concerned."
2184,2024-11-19T20:19:02Z,"India is the top rice exporter country in the world. It exports 3 times as much rice as the second highest rice exporting country viz. Thailand. Rice is already a highly water-intensive crop. Why do we grow it so much in surplus when it&#39;s already creating problems for us? And I&#39;m not just talking about stubble burning but also how much pressure has been put on groundwater due to it. States like Punjab and Haryana are not geographically suited for growing rice as much as they grow it. Farmers are using electric tubewells incessantly to draw out what little of groundwater is left in these states. It is happening just because govt. has been indiscriminately giving good MSP on it over the years. And not to forget the electricity freebie given out of taxpayers&#39; money to run those tubewells. The reason why straw burning from Punjab and Haryana has become more of a mayhem in recent years is because this particular agri cycle has been shifted to Oct-Nov by farmers due to groundwater issues in pre-monsoon season. If govt. had the political will or intent, it could&#39;ve provided some incentives to promote mechanised disposal of straw or linked MSP to straw procurement from farmers but apparently that won&#39;t turn out to be a vote-magnet like the electricity freebie. High time MSP must be discouraged on paddy and instead be enhanced on crops like maize, millets, oilseeds and pulses. This will not just  discourage exorbitant paddy production which is causing collateral problems but also ensure food and nutritional security for our population which already has a very high simple carbohydrates intake."

2187,2024-11-19T19:41:55Z,"The issue is not what the solutions are. Issue is lack of political intent towards implementing them. Politicians will always reach for low hanging fruits (short term solutions like GRAP measures) instead of study backed long term solutions that require dedicated investment or best practices which are sustainable year round and also effective rather than disruptive decrees like odd-even rule, or half-hearted measures like closing schools for children upto a certain grade. Government just tries to bide time somehow because they know it&#39;s an issue that&#39;ll recede in 40-45 days. Politicians are just a reflection of our society. So don&#39;t get too mad :) Even if the suggested solutions are given a go-ahead by the legislature, they&#39;ll be marred by ineffective enforcement by the concerned authorities because hey...we all know how rampant corruption is in this country. You give money and you can bypass all sorts of rules and regulations. Result? All looks well on paper but the ground realities are quite different."

Artificial rain will only bring down the particles not the harmful gases. We can see people using air filters and that means air is filled with particles, so that means, that is less related to stubble burning, vehicles, power plants, isn&#39;t it? The air filters doesn&#39;t magically produce oxygen by taking in these gases."

So is this because of stubble burning? Or something else? We don&#39;t see a sudden spike in pollution throughout the year, but it happens only in October-November. BC Diwali ko faltu mai badnam kar rakha hai."

2199,2024-11-19T18:48:03Z,"Solutions:The government must collaborate with ICAR &amp; create an FPO / Specialised body for Punjab-Haryana-Delhi-westUP region (or a cooperative regulatory body). This body can provide some rupees as incentives to the farmers for a pile of  harvested straws at a fixed rate (to be procured at village levels). It should enroll the farmers of those regions some Identifications.This regulatory body should have a well-developed working area with a treatment plant , Compost Area &amp; machinery required for making &quot;BRIQUETTES&quot; which is similar to firewood (TNAU achieved it)These procured stubbles should be used as the resources for that plant &amp; the manure (obtained by the treatment with ICAR Decomposer) can be given to those farmers who supplied the paddy straws at low prices. Rest can be sold at reasonable prices for others.To reduce SO2 Emission:The government should impose some regulations on the Thermal plants fueled by Coals to include certain composition of the &quot;BRIQUETTES&quot; along with the Coal, which would help to reduce the emission of hazardous Sulphur dioxide.Advantages by this method:1. Stubble burning is avoided &amp; less pollution.2. Solid waste Management.3. Production of Manure.4. Community participation leads to the significance of waste management to next generation of the critical zones.5. Employment and R&amp;D opportunities for ICAR member scientists, students &amp; other eligible people.6. Reduced level of SO2.7. LOW COST manure for farmers 8. Encouraging Sustainable Agriculture practice.9. BRIQUETTES can be stored for long time."

You Turn the soil...let it decompose thereby enriching the soil. You add various chemicals even nutrients to the soil m Crops must be rotated. Soil management. And Mostly. MOSTLY!  Yes India ...China... Russia have Rockets. Modern City&#39;s. But you neglect your farming. Agriculture is some guy with a few cows and some chickens walking in a field. Plowing with oxen. Or maybe.....Maybe a tractor. Behold!  America&#39;s Midwest. Modern one family with a few kids and several employees run a 500 acres farm. Cow&#39;s...dozens. Chickens...hundreds. Highly regulated. Very Expensive Tractors and equipment. But Farming is still farming. Its also highly profitable. Banks supply the loans for the tractor and equipment. The market builds the distribution network. Now you can specialize. Grow hybrid rice. Or carrots beets radishes by the Acre! Not some little plot. There is no waste...it can all be composted and put right back in the field.  But its rare. Markets determine what you grow. Global marketing.....it gets highly profitable. Farmer gets his cut. To keep it the best quality. Government over seas that. Look at the Midwest. No burning of fields here. They use to......long ago. It was a waste. Turn the soil.  But American soil was tough. Broke conventional wooden plows. John Deere made a steel one. Long before he became known for his tractor to pull it. He made a fortune off his steel plow. But he invested in a device that could pull it .... reliable. The rest is History. Hi Palki.

2301,2024-03-26T03:55:45Z,Is this really accurate? I am by no means pulling Australia down. I am happy to hear news that there is clean air in some parts of the world. but not so many years ago I heard news that Australia air especially in the cities is not in good status ( and also pairing it with forest fire news that happens to the country on occasional basis (I am sure we all heard this news ). And I have not heard any news on how are they are trying to clean that and now we hear WHO announces they breathe clean air? There something weird in this study.

2303,2024-03-25T21:55:50Z,"From a place in India which actually has good air because of frequent rain, and having just gone to on trip to other parts of India, it was very apparent the understanding a recent IIT study of source of the pollution- the second main problem in Indian cities being  particulate matter from road dust. The smog growing parallel to the increase in road network supports the same. Especially because we never bother to wash off road dust once in a while, don&#39;t strictly enforce any kind of particulate  control measure during construction and neither do we give two hoots about urdan landscaping or the absolute necessity of both broadleaved shade trees or groundcover to prevent dust from getting swept up. There is non stop work for an elevated highway happening in my city and from the trees that got cut down, to the refusal to take space for trees on median, to the heat and dust settling in the remaining trees also cause them to dry and die off....is just unbearably horrendous and ungodly. I absolutely lothe and hate everyone involved, in this cost cutting sh*t show.."

We don&#39;t have any strict laws to protect hygiene environment, Indian cine industry carry their cameras to Europe and America to shoot the film scenes or songs since all other countries looks beautiful except India, Indians fly abroad to lead a better life,since we don&#39;t have a infrastructure and hygiene like western counter parts. Do we really need 76 years to develop a nation and still we see garbage everywhere in India??? India has every natural beauty and people + government must preserve it with utmost discipline as we behave in other countries while we travel."

2476,2023-07-13T08:52:59Z,I’ve experienced the bad air quality when travelling in motor rickshaws in India. I wonder if despite the danger to health the ‘black carbon’ has a cooling effect as it does block out some of the suns heat. The recent cleaning of marine transport fuels reducing sulphur dioxide may have lead to global sea temperature rise along with absence of Saharan dust. It’s not a reason to not reduce pollution but something to be aware of.
2477,2023-07-13T08:34:34Z,These guys always show the dirtiest location of the dirtiest cities of eastern countries. That&#39;s what an ideal west media should be.Now lets talk about carbon emission and green energy of India.

2552,2025-02-08T21:44:37Z,Agree however Johnson also needs to meet our 60 year old Salman and Shahrukh type heroes who are 60 yet look 30
2553,2025-02-08T21:37:33Z,He can move to 28 states which has less air polluted or he can come to Kerala.
2554,2025-02-08T21:00:17Z,"This is all a big propaganda.............. Brian when too many locations near Bombay, took videos and photographs............. But only exactly during the podcast pollution became intolerable."

2558,2025-02-08T19:48:00Z,He is following the wording on cigrette box &quot;Die younger&quot;
2559,2025-02-08T19:35:45Z,Then the problam is his body not the air quality . westners fell sick by allo ticky which we are eating from eayrs
2560,2025-02-08T19:11:27Z,Indian people can tolerate their air better than foreigners. They become accustomed to it. Kindof like food in the Dominican.
2561,2025-02-08T19:03:18Z,He needs to be in the planet Mars
2562,2025-02-08T17:53:54Z,He looks like 50 to me!!! Miland woman was like this when  he was 60 year
2563,2025-02-08T17:43:30Z,"To be honest I love in a lush green area in Bihar and I think AQI is good here but when i went delhi,as soon as i stood outside of the house my eyes start to burn and irritate badly,my eyed we t red and continuously watered,Metro cities have this problem and no one is willing to fix this"

2569,2025-02-08T16:07:04Z,"Haahaahaa,what is the use of longevity and young skin if he can&#39;t survive for some hours in this situation. Thats why India is not for beginners"
2570,2025-02-08T16:03:55Z,That guy is too sensitive
2571,2025-02-08T15:58:46Z,It isn&#39;t individual problem but people as a whole. We need to learn civics sense ans self knowledge.
2572,2025-02-08T15:38:54Z,I live in Japan where the AQI stays below 40 even in the city (near Tokyo) so I can see where his frustration is coming from
2573,2025-02-08T15:32:26Z,Even people from USA feels the air is so dusty even inside homes ie any good restaurants. I e felt the carpet smell and dusty smell but others were okay. Somehow I feel like under tables and sofas or carpet needs shampoo cleaning somehow my nose blocks and that’s how I can feel. When I used to play in. India when I was kid in mud nothing I use to feel. May be staying long outside I feel really difference in the air quality especially in cities
2574,2025-02-08T15:32:10Z,He is right only. Bangalore is dying... Poor Urbanization policies... Destroying the nature
2575,2025-02-08T15:18:53Z,Palki please accept his assessment of air pollution in India.HERE counties abroad the air is pure and many illness are cured or kept at bay.I m experiencing it here in Italy.So go slow in critising  people of abroad countries as far as air .climate is concern
2576,2025-02-08T15:15:39Z,"It’s the truth, we breathe poison but our govt and the people are just not ready to face the reality!"

It’s been more than a year and my skin is still recovering. Btw I am an Indian and grew up in India. I was away for only some years.
2579,2025-02-08T14:53:47Z,He will comeback with another face and promote his anti aging products …..chronology samjhiye
2580,2025-02-08T14:44:16Z,"India is big century. The air quality in India in 2024 has varied by month and city. Some of the cleanest cities in India in 2024 include Satna, Mandikhera, and Gangtok. and i think he has a health  problem"
2581,2025-02-08T14:36:03Z,"Ahh... We villagers consuming more purifying air than a 5star hotel.Whenever I go to a city I can feel the difference, there sky looks like movie&#39;s war zone sky, hot air from passing big vehicles gives warm hugs &amp; the sound, nothing to say about it."
2582,2025-02-08T14:21:37Z,"Honest review from both sides, very good news indeed, Kudos"
2583,2025-02-08T14:09:44Z,Michael Jackson also want to live moreRich r like humme marna nhii hai300 saal rhnaa hai
2584,2025-02-08T14:05:58Z,Yes there is pollution...all developing countries faces similar hardship during evolution...but also his experiments upon him..destroyed his immunity....he should live more natural instead of putting so much artificial efforts to remain youthful forever.
2585,2025-02-08T13:58:24Z,Tis LAB RAT  BETTER looking only inside bubble.  for those who earn living by DAILY LABOR HAS NO use for tis conversation.
2586,2025-02-08T13:28:45Z,"We live in London and when yes when we visit family back home in Delhi i can see the difference, Delhi air is horrible beyond words"
2587,2025-02-08T13:03:08Z,Skin of a 22. Sorry but he looks like he&#39;s in his late 40&#39;s

2589,2025-02-08T12:42:11Z,Tell Delhi instead of India.
2590,2025-02-08T12:29:32Z,I understand that the AQI is bad for the health.But question here if he is so fit and spending so much money on his age reversal shouldn’t he have the more bearing capacity/immunity?Just a naive thought
2591,2025-02-08T12:24:53Z,“Anti Ageing Fanatic” this media has no shame… always suppressing the real problems of the country reaching the populace
2592,2025-02-08T12:08:20Z,And attitude of a 10 years old.
2593,2025-02-08T12:08:05Z,He is a snob.
2594,2025-02-08T11:37:28Z,This is the reasons for which we Indans are more strong and firm against any virus like Covid 19 but those white people can&#39;t survive. Better avod the soffesticated life.
2595,2025-02-08T11:05:01Z,He is having inadequate immunity Because in india even 70 yrs old don&#39;t have these symptoms in same atmosphere
2596,2025-02-08T10:49:37Z,Final verdict - he might attain the look of EVERLASTING YOUTH but eventually he might DIE YOUNG because he doesn’t have the secret of the Indians IMMUNITY!!!
2597,2025-02-08T10:48:37Z,This is what Britishers wanted and gained from india that’s why they divided they were utterly jealous of our resources and could not bear it and made india run after small things those which we were best in the world before any conquer
2598,2025-02-08T10:38:13Z,Wow! Air quality inside a five star hotel was 130.
2599,2025-02-08T10:24:11Z,This is not over the top. We are getting sick.
2600,2025-02-08T10:12:14Z,So he is lab rat...
2601,2025-02-08T10:05:17Z,this is just like covering it up but TBH the air feels a bit heavier in India compared to some other countries and it might not be his comfort zone where he came from. can&#39;t blame anyone here that&#39;s how this country is and that&#39;s how he might be used to
2602,2025-02-08T09:52:59Z,Hes 47 and he looks 47 to me. Nothing is different
2603,2025-02-08T09:48:42Z,Yeah it&#39;s true 100%
2604,2025-02-08T09:47:17Z,It must not be talking like that aqi 135 is a privilege. Then what about aqi 10. Human requirements are not valued in India. We must accept that and look for safe places on our own.
2605,2025-02-08T09:46:20Z,He is so weak
2606,2025-02-08T09:43:12Z,Our immunity is from mars. So plz manage urs.

2609,2025-02-08T09:29:22Z,"Nobody consider 130 aqi as being in Privilege, do some research before saying anything. An aqi of 130 is horrible even for Indian standards..."
2610,2025-02-08T09:25:44Z,And this is where patriotism needs to stop like seriously stop you are killing your own citizens
2611,2025-02-08T09:23:22Z,I&#39;m actually worried about my family&#39;s health! Kejriwal and other government officials should do something
2612,2025-02-08T09:22:00Z,Why he visited India???Pl its all marketing tactics. He came for his branding. Crazy man.भगवान इनको सदबुद्धी दें।
2613,2025-02-08T09:20:22Z,"He is 47 years oldHeart of 37 years old,. .Skin of 20 years old,. . Lungs of 18 years oldBut he looks like 55+ years old"

2615,2025-02-08T09:06:31Z,It&#39;s just due to change in weather from where he traveled
2616,2025-02-08T09:00:40Z,Good Indians want everything natural....not abnormal
2617,2025-02-08T08:52:30Z,Pls clean the air Delhi CM
2618,2025-02-08T08:48:54Z,He had a weak immune system.
2619,2025-02-08T08:48:05Z,Air quality here is 30-50 max. 130 is hazardous air so dont expect rest of world to be ok with 130.
2620,2025-02-08T08:48:00Z,I hate Delhi bcs of Pollution
2621,2025-02-08T08:42:27Z,I can feel it too. I was in Europe for a few weeks and now I can clearly feel the difference specially because I’m allergic and sensitive to pollution.
2622,2025-02-08T08:30:24Z,"It proves whatever you put on artificially does not stay longer. You better bring a bubble and live in it. It is not an India problem, it is your natural problem.Don&#39;t try to live on medicines.Try to live like a sage by mastering your metabolism and physical activity within your system. Ask any sage in India lived for hundreds of years and is living at present.It&#39;s incredible India. What you access and how you access is the difference."
2623,2025-02-08T08:25:15Z,He is right but you continue your job of bootlicking
2624,2025-02-08T08:22:27Z,Wait for GDP per Capita to reach 8000 dollors and watch pollution go away... thatsa what stopping us...not civic sense not population...
2625,2025-02-08T08:21:26Z,"I’ve come to India after ten years in America and I have been ill since time I’ve come back , allergies , breathing problems, rashes on skin . Bug bites .. wtf is modi and government doing ??"
2626,2025-02-08T08:10:08Z,"If you think he didn’t know that before coming to India! That his strategy! He needs more followers and views for his contents! Bro has spent millions, has to earn it back! He probably has a more expensive procedure to go through!"
2627,2025-02-08T08:02:36Z,"Checking on air quality map, Nepal looks even worse"
2628,2025-02-08T08:01:04Z,Huge respect to this man for showing india it&#39;s place  india&#39;s politicians are interested in only religious shit. Govt is not doing anything to save it&#39;s natural wealth.
2629,2025-02-08T08:00:52Z,They will link to vehicle pollution and tell to buy electric vehicles
2630,2025-02-08T07:59:56Z,India always need western criticism to make improvement
2631,2025-02-08T07:58:52Z,That’s the true picture of so called development in India. Sad state for the future generations and no one is taking it seriously!!
2632,2025-02-08T07:57:26Z,"Lol,what a wuss"
2633,2025-02-08T07:51:52Z,"If i talk about the uk right now, when you come out from your house in open air, you straight away feel Freshness in the air. You exact like a coming to a good AC room in india. You will like to deep breath in open air."

2635,2025-02-08T07:49:14Z,Its not just him a lot of foreigners cannot survive here. I remember actor called Charlie Hunnam came to india to shoot  a apple TV series. Dude got all kinds of infections . Only when you move out of India you&#39;ll know how good they have it there.
2636,2025-02-08T07:48:42Z,India&#39;s air pollution badly affects neighbouring countries as well.
2637,2025-02-08T07:46:49Z,"It&#39;s high time that India realise the severity of the air pollution otherwise the current and upcoming generations have to face major health struggles which will eventually deteriorate India&#39;s future. And it&#39;s not just a story of 1 city, it is applicable for all major cities in India."
2638,2025-02-08T07:43:09Z,He is nothing but a lame who scared of death he simply can’t afford to be look old because then he won’t grab that much attention from females
2639,2025-02-08T07:37:58Z,"He is not wrong and neither is he exaggerating, when I first came to Gurgaon in 2017 march , out of no where I got severe infection in my eyes , my eyes were swelled and watery for days to come. When the winter came I found it hard to breathe and I got the worst breakout in acnes which have left serious scars and I still keep getting them , I am someone who was not prone to acne as a teenager. We don’t realise these things because firstly we don’t have option and then slowly we get use to it ."
2640,2025-02-08T07:32:21Z,Fanatic.... Great choice of word..
2641,2025-02-08T07:27:54Z,Sad reality ..
2642,2025-02-08T07:05:33Z,"After the trip to India, his lungs age 50 ."
2643,2025-02-08T07:00:30Z,"Pollution is not a problem, we have bigger issues to solve, our nationalist media and nationalist party working hard on it"
2644,2025-02-08T06:49:05Z,"Modi and team have nothing other than religion , no pollution   cleaning discussion ever."
2645,2025-02-08T06:42:16Z,Who to complain? Who will listen to aam janta? Accept the truth
2646,2025-02-08T06:37:45Z,We are way too far in thinking about anti ageing while the majority cannot even reach the actual anticipated age. So forget the anti aging and fix the issue to at least live till an expected life
2647,2025-02-08T06:34:08Z,I can totally understand and get it i live in alberta i feel this air compared to indian air is 1000x better i am breathing here in india i was just taking pollution inside me
2648,2025-02-08T06:18:03Z,yeah india is not for beginners
2649,2025-02-08T06:03:49Z,Delhi air quality is bad enough to give people long troubling diseases.
2650,2025-02-08T05:55:04Z,Palki... you&#39;re not trying to pretend like Indian air is not toxic...are you..?
2651,2025-02-08T05:54:11Z,"You have to question Modi Govt , what they have been doing For 15 years and what are the policies and Implementations."
2652,2025-02-08T05:52:02Z,"She says the elderly, children, and pregnant women breath the air as if this american guy has entitlement issues. However, I see it that the government is failing the Indian people. Clean air isn&#39;t an entitlement. It&#39;s a REQUIREMENT! THE INDIAN PEOPLE DESERVE BETTER!!!"
2653,2025-02-08T05:49:39Z,Our heroes in india with all maintainence look good than him at 47 ......he still looks like 50 ...who told him he is baby
2654,2025-02-08T05:48:13Z,This Delhi election no political party talked about air quality or pollution. The SC does not care about pollution. The people don’t care. It’s simply a lost cause.
2655,2025-02-08T05:42:29Z,It&#39;s not just air pollution. There is water pollution also is an issue. And adulterated food products
2656,2025-02-08T05:33:04Z,"Forget Johnson, I&#39;m an Indian from Northeast. Last year I was in Delhi(I was going to Kashmir via Delhi). So I had to stay there for 1 night and guess what? Me and my family, we all were suffocating.  We could not breath. We had watery eyes. Next day when we left, we felt relieved."
2657,2025-02-08T05:32:58Z,we can&#39;t accept reality and blame who speaks facts and defend india blindly
2658,2025-02-08T05:32:58Z,"Population, pollution, change in education system Indian government really needs to think on this now. Its a high time.  Otherwise India will become hell to live ."
2659,2025-02-08T05:27:09Z,He said nothing wrong
2660,2025-02-08T05:22:01Z,Hes right
2661,2025-02-08T05:16:38Z,I have serious allergic cough for 2-3 years now. Can understand someone’s situation who breath in better air in his land
2662,2025-02-08T05:12:48Z,Agree with him. Indian air is very bad for health
2663,2025-02-08T05:09:45Z,"Property price in delhi , ncr should be minimum"

2665,2025-02-08T04:54:42Z,Send him to himalaya for age reversal
2666,2025-02-08T04:47:10Z,May be all this pollution is aging is faster
2667,2025-02-08T04:43:31Z,Create one video for the horns and open loud speakers everywhere and its impact on brain functioning
2668,2025-02-08T04:42:46Z,"He is right, India&#39;s air, water, soil is severely polluted."
2669,2025-02-08T04:41:28Z,"Phir bhi mera bharat mahaan. Dirty politics, corrupt administration, over population, low quality education and pseudo religious practices have ruined this beautiful and blessed land…"

2671,2025-02-08T04:33:30Z,Was he in the  hotel the whole time? NO
2672,2025-02-08T04:29:54Z,when u can&#39;t take criticism positively then u call someone fanatic.
2673,2025-02-08T04:28:51Z,Let america and europe manufacture their own goods and we will see how good air quality they can maintain..
2674,2025-02-08T04:16:17Z,When you stop staying India in general then there will be a significant improvement will happen. You must point the locations where the air quality is bad! Not all over the India the air qualities bad.
2675,2025-02-08T04:15:43Z,"There is pollution for sure. But if you are using all science to stay young then you are not young but a face of it, many people naturally dont look old."
2676,2025-02-08T04:09:17Z,"Indians might say that bryan is being too sensitive, but i think in reality India IS too polluted. We don&#39;t feel it as much as foreigners because we have become habituated to it, having grown up here. But if this continues even we will, one day, have to leave the country or carry oxygen cylinders 24x7 due to so much pollution. Delhi is already at such a condition, and it is the CAPITAL of our country..."
2677,2025-02-08T04:07:26Z,"Ask him to leave India! As it is, we are way more grounded, &amp; respect the natural Mortality bestowed upon us by Mother Nature! Anything or Anybody against Nature &amp; Negetive, must never be entertained. The repercussions of the artificially created religious lobbies rampantly going ahead with Jihad &amp; Conversion for &amp; by Money &amp; Power, since their inception, should have been enough testimony to refrain from anymore such digression! And this is only a minute tip of his Enormous Ulterior Mission with downsides in manifolds!"

2681,2025-02-08T03:47:31Z,I will be visiting India soon after a decade . Air quality and lack of clean bathrooms is keeping me awake at nights.
2682,2025-02-08T03:17:11Z,"He is not wrong, aqi 130 is horrible"
2683,2025-02-08T03:05:07Z,"Even With air purifier in that hotel the AQI was 130, in my city it’s 79 without air purifier. Off course he should be worried of the air quality"
2684,2025-02-08T02:57:25Z,No i was living in my hometown about 1.5 years ago and there AQI is arround 70-80.And I am currently in a city where AQI is about 200+ sometimes and It has drastically effected my sleep quality and I don&#39;t feel ease as I was feeling in my village.We have to  accept that yes AQI is a concerning matter rather than justifying that no AQI is fine .Wake up to really guys....!

2708,2025-02-07T22:41:10Z,Overpopulation is main reason for pollution in India
2709,2025-02-07T22:35:10Z,Badhiya notanki ki hai sir ne  yes air quality is bad but we are living in it. And i clearly accept that aqi is getting worse but inhe ekdam perfect environment chahiye q ki ye filhal ek lab rat bane huye hain to inhe maximum optimised air chahiye. Kharab hawa me rahna inke pure experiment aur paise ki value barbaad kar dega. Sir ko allergy hui hai aur bahar nikal gaye to koi issue nahi banna chahiye tha jitna ajkal internet bana deta hai
2710,2025-02-07T22:34:37Z,I hope the new govt do something about air pollution. I am sure there is a way
2711,2025-02-07T22:34:35Z,HE thinks he can live long . ( Who knows he might die in a aircrash or get hit by a bus in US ) .Who knows when and how will you die.Foolish to think he can reverse the age .

2718,2025-02-07T21:13:35Z,Don&#39;t blame him . We tolerate a lot of shit
2719,2025-02-07T21:08:57Z,"I agree that there is pollution in India which is not ok, and sudden changes in air quality does make it difficult to breathe. Having said that, the fact is that many Indians living in India in his age range are ageing way slower than he is  Sometime harsh conditions make you resilient."

I don&#39;t think it can solve in near time, but at least in 10 to 15 years time changes should come ..else aging population may face a lot of issues ...faster infra, clean energy, better public transport, more green tree cover, more ground water ...lot of things to do"
2724,2025-02-07T20:06:17Z,"Why is the government not using cows to purify air, why"
2725,2025-02-07T20:04:29Z,This has a lot to do with corner cutting in small scale industries and farming practices like stubble burning.

2733,2025-02-07T18:31:37Z,"Why putting standards according to him, He seems more sensitive to air not us. Also many foreigners have come to India and they are ok/fine."
2734,2025-02-07T18:29:51Z,"As an Indian living in the West, I can 100% confirm India’s living conditions are not even sub-optimal - water, air and food, all three are not at global standards.It hurts when Westerners criticize India for these things but we have to accept it and change this.Politicians in Delhi irrespective of their political affiliations don’t care about their own citizens.Seems like everyone has got used to the rising pollution levels which is sad."

Stop living in fake world, come in terms to reality! This is one of the reasons people migrate to other countries these days!India is not a superpower at least till it tackles these issues and gets over its orthodox mentality, caste systems, politics etc."

2813,2025-02-07T07:24:26Z,Why does she take such long irritating pauses. Gives me a feeling she gives too much importance to herself and takes herself too seriously.
2814,2025-02-07T07:12:47Z,"That is absolutely true. Our air quality being what it is does not make it okay. Like our traffic conditions and abject lack of education/understanding of basic mass vehicular safe movement - we are used to it, but it is a big factor preventing the perception of us even moving towards being a developed nation."
2815,2025-02-07T07:08:46Z,Ok Thankyou..we have a huge population..please live in your country..we do yoga and manage and live e more 75 years....we do not eat packet goods like whites..ok

After such great anti aging treatments he is taking though he can not tolerate bad weather it seems that he had low immunity. In india many yogis are wearing only dhoti and though survive and living long.So real anti aging and long living is detailed in Ayurveda.Follow it.
2822,2025-02-07T06:25:55Z,India is so obsessed with caste reservations and secularism that real issues have taken a backseat !!!!

2912,2025-02-06T12:20:50Z,"Indian&#39;s focus more on politics, population, and noise pollution. Oh yes, also on religion, but some of the religious places are kept so dirty at some places, and we call ourselves religious people even God&#39;s, place we can&#39;t keep clean and tidy.

Why ? Because in Canada the Air quality remains zero all times, whereas in india all times high. Even I am indian lived a longest life thr but after 8 years of living outside india i realized what is called Air quality, food quality &amp; personal rights. I tagged indians the most illiterate bcs one least example is this that india does not seem to have waste management and people so stupid they r burning trash like all the plastic stuff just to feel warm in winters.

Can you imagine what&#39;s going on with those who smoke regularly . Alarming but we Indians are busy with life Jo khud hi danger mai hai
2938,2025-02-06T02:53:32Z,We do not realize here in India.. But live for few months outside(somewhere clean)and when you comeback you can feel it..
2939,2025-02-06T02:47:47Z,We complain with whom all are sleeping
2940,2025-02-06T02:31:55Z,Even when china was facing the exact problem five six years back they tackled this by installing the world&#39;s largest air purifier for 3000 crores whereas India on the exact same year had spent the 3000 crores on building sardar patel statue. Definitely Indian system has to abolish this idiotic culture of honouring the heroes and instead to work out in the present that needs a lot help.
2941,2025-02-06T02:18:22Z,How can factory be without polution all these developing countries set their factors in India now claiming for clean air what about gas trajady in bhopal till.now no compansastion for victims indians unsing foreign products then close foreign factories or put taxes for polutions especially foreign aid factorys

2943,2025-02-06T01:43:19Z,A gift from the rulers of Punjab and Delhi. The broom polluted the air. Period.
2944,2025-02-06T01:27:29Z,"He’s 100% correct don’t just foolishly criticize him, Air Quality is extremely bad in Delhi!! At least he had the courage to speak and people like you are forced to make a news story about it  or else when regular citizens complain you guys just ignore them!! He did a very Good Job  by criticizing"
2945,2025-02-06T01:20:29Z,YES HE HAS POINTED THE FACT
2946,2025-02-06T00:46:44Z,This is absolutely right. Air quality is toxic in Delhi compare to other states of India . good air is really important to us
2947,2025-02-05T23:53:19Z,He still looking 47 years old..

2949,2025-02-05T19:02:30Z,He is not doing any anti-aging things just making up stories  a lung of 18 year old at age of 47 that was really a joke. Is he man or a lizard   good food can really do good with your health but what he is doing is surviving on medicine or in control environment. I had seen his videos. He is living a life of a lab rat not as human.
2950,2025-02-05T12:41:01Z,"What&#39;s the use of anti aging if his immunity is sooo low.If his lungs were so young, then they must be able to handle the Delhi pollution. Even 50, 60 years old peoples lungs are able to handle the Delhi pollution, then why can&#39;t his 30 year old lungs handle the pollution. He is a big sham"
2951,2025-02-05T09:05:24Z,Air quality in Colombo today is 43 and Melbourne 37

2956,2025-02-05T07:45:55Z,"Palki, you hit the nail on the head. China faced similar challenges but successfully integrated cleanliness and environmental awareness into their society. Unfortunately, in India, we often limit &#39;cleanliness&#39; to just our homes, shifting the trash to places we can conveniently ignore. It&#39;s time for a mindset shift where road safety, cleanliness, environmental sustainability, and critical thinking become core priorities in our education system alongside academics. The government aside from the political agenda, should approach these issues with the seriousness of a well-managed project—set goals, create a Gantt chart, and ensure tangible milestones are achieved. Only then can we build a healthier, happier, and more responsible nation."

2967,2025-02-05T05:46:28Z,The truth is he planned it the night before .The room had multiple air purifiers on. He probably just did it to increase his credibility in front of his white masters.
2968,2025-02-05T05:34:07Z,"Remove Arvind Kejriwal from Delhi. He has damaged city alot, dumped Delhi with slums , illegal rohingya immigrants and made the city worst .

3000,2025-02-04T18:50:54Z,"As soon as I landed in Delhi airport, it felt like a chemical factory. India should seriously find ways to improve the air quality in her Cities and Urban areas. All the riches they have has no meaning if they can’t breathe normal air."

3004,2025-02-09T03:51:12Z,Kejriwal neither resolved air pollution nor did he help cleaning yamuna . Still he is model personality
3005,2025-02-05T17:19:07Z,"Increase petrol diesel price and subsidize electricity and provide maximum charging points for nominal rate ( using the money obtained from excess tax on fuel levied ) reduce registration and other charges on electric vehicles so that people can shift to them. Also that much electricity generation also causes pollution, minimize it by using solar plants."
3006,2025-02-03T15:41:32Z,He is speaking against farmer but not about their own activities Whtt about firecrackers bro ?

3025,2024-12-02T15:31:01Z,Farmers burn residual for only 2 month every year. But what about next 10 months.
3026,2024-12-02T09:05:58Z,Nowadays most of the influencers only blaming punjab and haryana for pollution Does Delhi itself not causing pollution
3027,2024-12-01T22:20:49Z,Why?  because you don’t give a f..k about the nature… simple
3028,2024-11-29T18:56:27Z,"1) Use of smoke to ink converters.These little guys fit on the exaust pipe of vehicles and convert smoke to ink. This will be effective for pollution due to vehicular emmissions.2) Green city concept. Increase green cover like singapore and Increases number of lakes. This will cause Increase of rain in delhi, and plants obviously trap dust. This will be effective for pollution due to road dust.3) Implement Indore model so that there isn&#39;t further increase in garbage hills and burning of garbage.4) Govt should ensure proper following of norms in construction activities.5) Improvement in road quality and overall infrastructure, removal of illegal encroachment on road side which causes Increase in road dust and traffic jams.6) Govt should leave the above steps implementation on retired military officers or retired civil servents because they are disciplined and know how to better implement things on ground.Now we individually can do the following:1) Atleast be responsible at your level. Don&#39;t throw garbage here and there, and please don&#39;t absolutely burn it. Make compost of wet garbage. Use CNG or electric vehicle if possible and best if use Metro. 2) Get a n99 or n95 mask and wear it when going outside. I think masks like oxiclear mask are practical as it has replacable filters and one filter will be with you for one month. Regular n99 or n95 masks life is for few days so you have to throw it after that.3) Also, best if you live indoor as far as possible. And get an air purifier. In this I think airth air purifier is a great innovation developed at IITK and IIsc Bangalore. This will cost you only 3000 for winter version and 2000 for summer version(coz in summers too air is toxic ). These purifiers sit on indoor AC and makes AC as your air purifier. And don&#39;t worry in winters AC can be run on fan mode which will only run indoor AC and AC will not cool your room, plus fan mode doesn&#39;t costs high electricity bills :). One filter will easily be with you for a full season.4) Have a healthy lifestyle and diet. Please have a proper sleep. Your body needs time to repair the damage caused by pollution. Lock me out is a great app to fix your schedule and phone addiction, coz I know this mobile is greatest culprit for postponing and devastating your sleep. And you can also tell your parents or who can take phone from you to take phone from you after 8 pm and reward a crackling slap for retaliation if they desire so!..And please don&#39;t throw junk in your body as far as possible. Eat Healthy. Eat prebiotics and probiotics. Your gut will improve and so will your body&#39;s ability to combat pollution. Eat salad before your meal. Salad can include cucumber, beaetroot, etc. Beetroot is great. Salad is good for gut and it also lowers glisemic index of meal and prevents overeating. Remember to not overload your tummy coz salad can cause you to eat less than you normally eat. Overloading will cause indigestion. Keep your tummy light. Also, include Amla for sure sure. Research has shown it&#39;s beneficial effects in combating air pollution. For prebiotics, eat Home made pickle. It should be Home made, market pickle has refined oils and unnecessary preservatives. Drink Kanji, Buttermilk. Can eat curd, etc. And I suggest to avoid curd, salad or Buttermilk at evening or post sunset as Ayurveda prohibits it. And if possible keep your eating between sunrise and sunset. And keep your last meal of the day as light as possible and have a gap of atleast 2 hours between your last meal and sleep. It will improve sleep quality and your body will have time to repair itself during sleep insted of being busy in digestion for most of the time. Also, Do exercise for sure. Please don&#39;t exercise outdoor, keep exercise indoor. Exercising in pollution will make it reach in deepest places of your lungs. Also, exercise indoor with air purifier. Do pranayam specially kapalbhati(it detoxify lungs). Do yoga and meditation, it reduces stress.5) Please change your attitude. Take this problem of pollution seriously. It has serious impact on you and your loved ones health and therefore serious impact on your relations, economy and overall development. In europe 200 aqi is declared national emergency and on 18 nov aqi reached 1200 in Delhi.6) Spread awareness regarding this topic.Thankyou for reading!You are free add more points in replies:)."

To sow wheat for next season, farmers have to remove paddy waste and the most easiest and cost efficient way is burning paddy waste.2. Giving money to superseeder( an equipment that helps paddy waste to be mixed with soil) owners and get paddy waste mixed with soil for which they don&#39;t have enough money cause they ain&#39;t getting enough from selling paddy.Hope people like you understands the concern here!"

Create list of coal like substance that creates equal pollution, invest in different alternate sources to achieve same industrial applications2) Tax farmers  for violation and create ecosystem for subsidized thrashers and machinery3) Create a list of old construction and limit new construction by using some density matrix.4) promote public vehicles or low emission models of personal vehicles5) Ban crackers and punish sellers and buyers like in 2018-2019. Promote cracker free diwali_________what does govt do??1)ban crackers but leave loopholes to not properly implement2) Penalized personal cars only in event of apocalypse like situation3) Don&#39;t educate rigid farmers about dangers with proper force to win them as vote banks4) Pass construction projects without creating a sustainable construction model5) Take lots of money from industrialists and become their bi*ches and penalised small factory owners"

3085,2023-10-29T04:55:12Z,"Best solution to pollution will be manufacturing Bioethnol Plants. Raw materials for this will be agricultural wastes (Parli).Results of Bioethnol Plants are multidimensional:- Reduction in Pollution by reduced Parli burning (as more and more Parli will be consumed in plant)- Reduction in Pollution from Automobile exhaust ( since Bioethnol is cleaner fuel than traditional petrol and diesel)- increased income of farmers (by selling the Parli to Bioethnol Plants)- Lesser import of Crude petroleumAlready technology is available in India for Bioethnol production (one of such technology provider is Praj industry of Puna, and India Glycol company of Himachal Pradesh is already manufacturing it)In 2016-18 Indian Govt was urging IOCL, BPCL, HPCL to set up Bioethnol manufacturing plants. This production in Bioethnol will single-handedly solve a lot of issues ranging from-pollution-empowerment of farmer- reduction in Fossil fuels dependency- Towards Atmanirbharta"

3097,2023-06-08T17:36:52Z,You guys don’t see the problem it’s is within Delhi it’s not always Punjab and Haryana burning paddy straw. So how people have every thing that burning is because of farmers what international airport in Delhi a lot Airbus that is used in commercial international travel. Have ever thought 1 billion ton carbon dioxide is emission by commercial planes and in farming it is less than it. And if you wants farmers to stop burning why don’t make petrol cheaper for farmers then. I have given a solution but it’s not cheap to clear everything with tractor it’s mileage is only 5-10. Make the petrol cheaper farmers will stop themselves burning crop. It’s easy to teach but very difficult preach.
3098,2023-06-07T16:09:26Z,What about industrial smoke and waste it is easy to blame farmer

Certain individuals with a mindset focused on extracting maximum value from the allowances given to them tend to excessively use electricity by keeping all the lights on at their workplace and setting the AC temperature to 16 degrees Celsius, assuming that coal-generated electricity is limitless and without cost."

3133,2023-05-27T16:08:13Z,"So the states that burn the stubble are not polluted but there urban neighbor is. Use your common sense guys. Delhi is polluted at moderate levels throughout out the year while Haryana and Punjab have low levels, Delhi&#39;s level jumps because it is crowded and has a lot of traffic there. Because of this there levels jumps from Moderate to High while the states where the stubble is actually being burned stay at low or moderate risk despite the stubble burning right next to where they live. So the fundamental problem is with Delhi not these states."
3134,2023-05-27T15:51:03Z,"The fact that they blame vehicular emissions shows their illiteracy. A well maintained petrol or diesel car will never release unburnt residue. If your car releases black or white smoke, get the air filters, gaskets and lubrication system checked. I have been owning adiesel car for 11 years (mahindra scorpio) and it has never shown any sign of black smoke. A lot of people drive 30 year old cars in developed countries and still there haven&#39;t been much sign of air pollution out there."

3139,2023-05-27T14:38:09Z,The topic is deeper and more complex than what is covered in a short. Why are the farmers forced to burn the residuals?
3140,2023-05-27T14:18:22Z,"Installing solar panels, giving huge incentive on switching to electric vehicles, collecting farm residue from neighbouring states and maybe decompose it in some other way and for immediate help, installing 100 air purifier towers in the city will help."

Next the Pakistani government is going to say imran Khan is behind the pollution!!!
3170,2024-12-20T20:58:08Z,"Air pollution is a critical issue affecting millions in urban areas, particularly in cities like Delhi. While China has made significant investments in large air purifiers to combat this problem, similar initiatives could be beneficial in Delhi as well. Wealthy residents of Delhi, including millionaires, have the resources to contribute to community welfare. By coming together to fund the installation of large air purifiers, they can make a substantial impact on local air quality. This collective effort could inspire others to join and create a ripple effect throughout the city.  If citizens take the initiative to improve air quality through such projects, it may prompt government officials and politicians to recognize the urgency of the situation and take further action. Public pressure and visible community efforts can lead to more comprehensive policies aimed at reducing pollution. Encouraging collaboration among affluent individuals for social service initiatives like installing air purifiers could not only enhance public health but also motivate governmental bodies to prioritize environmental issues. Affluent individuals often have access to networks that can facilitate large-scale projects. By encouraging collaboration among these individuals, we can create impactful initiatives that not only focus on planting trees but also promote sustainable practices within communities. This could involve forming partnerships with environmental organizations or investing in local community projects aimed at reforestation.The youth represent a significant portion of the population and possess unique capabilities to drive change through social media and grassroots movements. Instead of spending time on activities like dancing on social media reels, young people should be encouraged to engage in environmental activism. This could include organizing local tree-planting events, participating in educational campaigns about the importance of trees, or advocating for policies that support environmental sustainability."
3171,2024-12-01T09:36:31Z,this supposedly where the brightest minds come from? What a joke!
3172,2024-12-01T02:41:39Z,"300 billion dollars ain&#39;t enough to satisfy the Indian ego.  Remember, was it India that &quot;asks&quot; for 1 trillion dollars during COP26 in Glasgow dated November 2021? Do not insult India with that measly 300 billion dollars (COP29), OK?"

Take a look at how many cows roam on the streets and how much  they littered and were not covered up? Methane gases released into the atmosphere? |n di a needs to be sanctioned!"
3174,2024-12-01T02:40:54Z,"India is acting important on all social medias again. All Indian medias are saying that &quot;India rejected the deal of COP29&quot;? What they do not understand is that the deal was made for all developing countries. The deal wasn&#39;t made exclusively for India. India does not represent all developing countries and hence, they are in no rightful position to reject the deal on behalf of all developing countries. Only the recipient countries, COLLECTIVELY and unanimously, can reject the deal. The title of their news headlines were worded in such a way to make India look important, as if they are the SOLE recipient for the deal and that they call the shots for all developing countries. India wants to look important and wants to be the leader of the Global South or developing countries but has every developing countries or countries of the Global South ever come together and elect a leader? No. India should know its place and stop ttrying so hard."
3175,2024-12-01T02:40:45Z,"The difference between China and India is that when China is down and out and industrializing, they did not demand that the entire world should pay them 1 trillion dollars as climate finance, unlike India, during COP26 held in Glasgow dated November 2021. This is not a one time example. India being the 5th largest economy of the world, has never hosted the Olympic games when they are poor/rich, unlike China. China had voluntarily made a bid to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the right to host the Olympic games in year 2008 when they are poor, and once again in the year of 2022 when they are much wealthier. That is the difference in ethics and culture between these countries. One believes in &quot;the spirit of giving unconditionally&quot; or generosity no matter whether they are rich or poor, the other believes in taking but not sharing/giving. That is Indian culture versus the Chinese culture. Criticize France for as many times as you want, calling them &quot;cheap&quot; or &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;miser&quot; but the fact remains.... France is generous enough to host the Olympic Games free of charge, unlike the #1 extremely superpower (self-proclaimed) on the Internet, India."

Hence, India, being the 5th largest economy and a superpower (whether true or self-proclaimed, it does not matter), refused to donate and play a part in &quot;the deal of COP29&quot;? Have you seen this? ‘India needs you’: Priyanka Chopra sets up Covid fundraiser, urges world to donate? Remember the whole world aided India during the pandemic when Indian mishandled the pandemic? Remind me, which country &quot;asked&quot;  for donations/oxygen tanks/ventilators from the entire world because they had mishandled the pandemic? What are &quot;PM CARE FUNDS&quot;? Because At least 4.7 million people died in India due to Covid-19 in 2020 and 2021, the World Health Organization said on Thursday (HindustanTimes) ??"

Children are suffering and dying but the governments remain indifferent content to outdo each other in a race that does nothing for the common man. Imagine if they competed in healthcare instead—people could finally live and breathe in a healthier environment.

India also took measures many years ago, and the Indian government is really shit. Chinese people now earn five times as much as Indians, and most people have cars and luxury apartments or villas. I come from a small city, my car is Tesla, my car in our company is only ordinary. My sister goes to the bar every weekend and comes home around one o&#39;clock in the morning every time, china is very safe. The air is also very good. I really don&#39;t understand why the Indian government does everything like rubbish, but there are still many ignorant Indians who think India is a superpower. I really can’t understand."
3710,2024-12-06T13:30:00Z,"3:11 Govt of India / Delhi Govt is more focused on squeezing hard earned income in the form of GST, CGST etc but does not provide basic right (clean air)."
3711,2024-12-06T10:03:11Z,The air can&#39;t be that bad as they showed a couple of joggers casually running in the street.  People are also biking around like it was nothing. Humans likely adjust to the air quality as new generations are born into it.  It&#39;s probably unpleasant to breathe that smog but it&#39;s not fatal.  People aren&#39;t exactly dropping dead in the streets from breathing that air.  Many people aren&#39;t even wearing masks so it can&#39;t be that bad.
3712,2024-12-02T11:34:23Z,"China, on the other hand, simply make its air pollution goes away, while still maintaining its role as world&#39;s manufacturing hub.  In fact, Chinese manufacturing is growing even more.  Their latest export number has reached $1T (yes that is a T) for 2024.  Record breaking.Chinese never blame.  Chinese never talk.  They just see a pollution problem and fix the problem.  While fixing the pollution problem, they realize EV is one of the main solutions.  So, guess what, they simply become the biggest EV maker in the world.  Indians, please stop talking.  Please stop making excuses.  Please stop blaming others.  Be quiet.  And just go to work.  Don&#39;t get hallucination from comparing with China, blaming China, making up fake stories about China.  Work with China."
3713,2024-12-02T07:11:55Z,Please tell your totalitarian government to solve this disaster
3714,2024-12-02T03:44:02Z,Amazed and shocked how politicians are playing with the life of people can&#39;t believe that politics can go to this embarrassing level
3715,2024-12-01T03:56:38Z,All because of increasing population
3716,2024-11-30T07:39:15Z,Not just in India your pollution is spreading to US and Canada just ask the Canadian
3717,2024-11-30T06:45:25Z,"i left delhi, and have never been happier. took me 6 years of steroids during my youth to cure my allergies... only to come to delhi and revive it after so many years of being without it. i had to take allergy meds within a week of being there... and had to continue it everyday and had to increase my dosage. closed my doors, windows... still had no beneficial effect. ultimately packed my bags and left, and the cold allergies left me within days. no more meds. i earn less, but my health is more valuable. this was a decade ago. i can&#39;t imagine how much worse it has become now."

3720,2024-11-27T17:58:25Z,You need 1 party system so the politicians can&#39;t blame the other party and not getting any real results. Need to get politicians held accountable.
3721,2024-11-27T11:13:48Z,"the hilarious is, The “supreme” leader who has been in the seat for last 10 years, never given a single press conference. N the clown media never asked him"
3722,2024-11-27T06:59:24Z,Delhi is worse than LA in the 70s!!! Worse than Beijing? Thats Crininal too let tour Tax Payers Breath thatcGarbage. Its Inhumane.

3725,2024-11-26T13:21:07Z,"Lady, you are highlighting this issue only because it is staring at you and you are breathing it during every breath.  I understand your indignation at the powers that be within Delhi’s power structure. Do U know this kind of indignation is EXACTLY how the people living in second and third tier cities — not to speak of the “unpad” rural folks —feel towards  people living in big metros in India?These metrowallahs, they feel, suck up all the new improvements — the new metro trains, better medical facilities within walking or driving distance, good and prestigious  schools and colleges, contacts with the rich and powerful… …For all these privileges you enjoy while denying to others in smaller towns, you must pay your price such as severe air and water pollution, unkempt roads and people littering everywhere, overcrowded commercial space with no open public space… You are paying the price for your — the collective “your” mettowallahs — greed and hubris. Kollengode S Venkataraman"
3726,2024-11-26T10:12:34Z,Good luck solving this under capitalism.
3727,2024-11-26T04:50:25Z,"This video on YouTube emphasizes the importance of maintaining good air quality in homes to mitigate the effects of Delhi&#39;s high air pollution levels. It highlights safe practices such as using air purifiers, ensuring proper ventilation, and incorporating air-purifying plants. These measures are presented as effective ways to enhance indoor air quality and create a healthier living environment​"
3728,2024-11-26T04:38:50Z,"So now the question remains...Which is worst, China or India?"
3729,2024-11-26T02:32:37Z,"Seriously SMH! Politicians need to focus on air, noise pollution rather than  unnecessary stuff. Winter or Summer- one and the same!"

3731,2024-11-25T22:51:13Z,Where are Tatas and Ambanis and all big rich Indians who are proud to be Indians. Shame
3732,2024-11-25T22:17:19Z,Just like their friends in China! The sky don&#39;t lie! It&#39;s like that because the people will do anything for maximum profit instead of doing what&#39;s right and making a normal profit those extra few dollars they make ends up costing them trillions later. Maybe if so many in power stopped taking bribes and let the system work the way it&#39;s supposed to. They are polluting the world! I think heavy sanctions would help correct some of the worse abuse. A rich factory owner doesn&#39;t care he just wants money even if it will kill him and his family later. I think the whole region over there needs to be re-educated about how they look at money. They are going to kill themselves and us if this continues!
3733,2024-11-25T22:01:09Z,Now you&#39;re speaking
3734,2024-11-25T20:11:44Z,And then people who move overseas due to this broken system and low standard of life they are shamed.

3738,2024-11-25T14:26:46Z,"Palki, you have been telling me that Delhi is the best in the world in the past few years.  What changed?"
3739,2024-11-25T13:48:48Z,"I just checked and cleanest city of India has AQI of 101, which is pretty high for the cleanest city"

3743,2024-11-25T08:50:10Z,Modi sucks up the billionaires but doesn&#39;t do anything for the poor people of India. I respect Palki for her courage to speak up.

You can reduce petrol, diesel vehicles and polluting factories can relocate in other cities. Encouraging public transport and making specific lane for bicycle and pedestrian and more strict care of municipal corporation and centre can encourage surrounding states to teach their farmers to manage their farm waste in right way and we have the technology to reduce it if works with good will because it&#39;s very important to understand climate change and global warming is real and we are facing its impacts."

Until something very radical is done to your society, I don&#39;t think you can solve many of your basic problems. Don&#39;t take my comments as a criticism.

India heavily compromised the health of their citizens to achieve the so called &quot;1st world country&quot;. Now their own actions bitting them harder than anticipated. Sharing from my own experience, I had been to Bangalore before the city became a Global IT Hub. Wonderful city with weather and cleanness, now Bangalore is like another polluted city in India. Very sad situation.Same goes to the water resource of India, unbelievable state, all of the major rivers flows through India were polluted. Is this the &quot;Beginning of the End&quot;. ?"

China&#39;s lower pollution levels are due to very little industrial activities because of total economic collapse.

3879,2024-11-21T08:36:59Z,"Lol your team is dumb, we dont have pollution,  its winter, so its dew (vapour) in this season. We are literally covered by jungle and have ver low population. Delhi have this problem due to farmers burning a specific crop. Here we live near coast so dont have such problems."
3880,2024-11-21T07:55:09Z,"To ensure pure air and consistently good air quality (AQI below 50) in every Indian city, it is essential to implement a robust Urban Green and Water Plan. This plan would prioritize sustainable urban greenery, water conservation, and eco-friendly infrastructure, creating healthier and cleaner environments for everyone.Urban Green and Water PlanGREEN PLAN :1. Establish a minimum of 40% green cover in every city2. Shady trees should be planted along the central verge and roadsides of every street in the city, providing shade for pedestrians and commuters.3. Implement rain gardens to manage stormwater and enhance biodiversity.4. Create Miyawaki forests in suitable locations to rapidly increase urban green cover.5. Dense plantation of small trees beneath bridges, elevated corridors, and flyovers6. Plant large shade trees, and initiate avenue tree plantation along major roads and public areas.7. Enforce a mandatory provision for residential societies and neighborhoods to maintain at least 40% green space8. Ensure a minimum of 30% greenery in every commercial market, and make it mandatory for all commercial buildings or complexes to dedicate 20% of their space to greenery.Conclusion: The finest example of urbangreenery is ensuring that every available space in the city is utilized for Greenery.Water Plan1. Develop numerous lakes, ponds, and water bodies across the city based on space availability.2. Make rainwater harvesting mandatory for all those using borewells.3. Promote large-scale implementation of water recycling and treatment plants4. Roads in cities should be designed in a way that allows rainwater to flow into the central verge for effective drainage and water conservation.5. Water recharge pits should be constructed throughout the city based on space availability to enhance groundwater replenishment.6. Use permeable materials for pavements and driveways to allow rainwater to infiltrate the ground, reducing runoff and increasing groundwater recharge.7. Conduct regular water audits for homes and businesses to identify areas where water can be conservedConclusion: The best example of waterconservation is to preserve as much water as possible in cities, ensuring that clean water is available at all times and even during extended periods of insufficient rainfall, cities should still have a sufficient supply of water available."

So govt should employ more people to do this job.Industrialists must be fined heavily if found polluting.Those builders who are not covering their materials must be penalized.

Those water spraying trucks look ridiculous as band aid solution. Talking about progress going the wrong way. What so hard about seeding the cloud to make rain? We in Indonesia do not make hypersonic missiles, or aircraft carrier. But we know how to make artificial rain. We need it. We had similar problems with forest fire before. Yes, forest fire! Not farmers burning crop waste. Forest fire is bigger and more serious that farmers burnings, but we took care of it!

3935,2024-11-20T19:37:20Z,"Finally a fair and balanced report mentioning China from Palki. I thank her as a Chinese viewer. Everything she said was correct about China. Our pollution was terrible just a few years go, and it is much better controlled now.  However, please note that it didn&#39;t come easy.  The clean-energy push was hard on traditional energy sector, and millions of Chinese factory workers were displaced away from major cities.  To resolve the pollution problem, India needs to make tough choices, and some people&#39;s interests and wellbeing will be impacted.  I sincerely wish India can make the tough decision and transition the country on track for sustainable and fast development while managing the fallout from whom that sacrifice along the way.  It would be terrible to get stuck in the endless blaming game between different parties and interest groups where no decision or change can be made.  As neighbors, I hope Chinese and Indian media don&#39;t laugh at each other&#39;s &quot;tough decisions&quot; and counter-argue every point along the way.  We all face the same challenges and want a better future for our people."

Other factories must be relocated etc. Everybody must work together to get rid of air pollution."

3980,2024-11-20T12:59:20Z,"Regime change and blame games cannot solve this issue. I am surprised people take air and water pollution as a joke in our country.And plus its our mentality. Most of us buy water filters to filter the water coming to our houses. Buys air filters to do the same when the real problem can be solved with a lesser investment. Sad truth is we unknowingly go for custom solutions instead of a generalized solution for everyone. Once that changes we can do better in most aspects. Palki did tell about China whom most of us see in a different angle. They do have privacy and labour issues and the type of government is not something you want to be ruled by. But they seem to be doing way better than us when it comes to tech and environment, being the place with the highest number of manufacturing hubs. At least living there won&#39;t cut your lifespan by half.And this is just the start. There&#39;s gonna be a series of companies war profiteering during such situations when we are dying (as we saw during COVID)."

Delhi government has to ban diesel and petrol vehicles. I not immediately, it should be done in phases. Another issue is with stubble burning by farmers. Central government needs to impose a ban and levy fines for stubble burning. Alternative methods must be devised and made mainstream. Political will is needed to solve this issue.

4021,2024-11-20T08:15:35Z,"Nothing new.....good content for a news headline!!!!We want luxurious lives with all the facilities, while holding on to our traditions and culture. We love to talk about tradition, culture, and modernization, but we don’t want to put in any effort towards maintaining or improving them. We constantly discuss pollution, unhealthy food, scarcity of resources, and other critical issues like water shortages, waste management problems, and deforestation. But we rarely take any meaningful action.For example, we change our mobile phones every year, not out of necessity but because of fashion. This is just one example of many things we do for show off rather than need. We don&#39;t consider the carbon emissions and environmental impact of manufacturing these devices.Some &quot;wise-fool&quot; people (idk what appropriate term do i use for them) talk about the pollution caused by burning crackers during diwali and wood during lohri and holi dahan. Yet, they ignore the massive carbon emissions, producing from every single product, especially plastic ones, that we majorly use and discard or replace merely for the sake of fashion. Plastic is one of the worst (more than worst) contributors to various types of pollution on this planet.There is so much more to say on this topic, but I know this isn’t the right platform for a detailed discussion. One thing is clear: we all need to put in efforts to address these issues. The government alone cant do everything."

Aur abhi delhi mei nayi metro aayi hai jo actual mei jo organisation responsible hoti hai voh center ke under hoti hai. Aur cm apne upar credit le rahi hai.It is shameful that the center govt hasn&#39;t said anything regarding this and the state govt can only ban crackers on diwali.

For ex. smoking cigerrates, Burning Leftovers after cropping their fields etc. I don&#39;t know what to say anymore instead of blaming the government why cant we take action on those who do such things. Does government  need to see air that&#39;s going inside your nostrils should be pure. When some guys just be a chainsmokers and doing air pollution everywhere they go. Kinda absurd statement according to me. Instead of asking government I think people of the country should take steps for that. You&#39;re solely relying on government for such things too. Govenment is for giving pathways to live an easy life not for keeping your life intact when some guys pollute the ain in itself. Sorry but I don&#39;t consider your statement to be beneficial. Blame people not government I guess that should be the agenda for this chit-chat."

It&#39;s just frustrating; many people act as if they are freedom fighters, and instead of focusing on bigger issues like pollution, humanity, etc., they engage in petty arguments or gossips and in materialistic want or try to show who&#39;s the toughest.FYI, I know we have so many beautiful and garbage or pollution free places, but in general we are way behind European states in terms of development and sense of cleanliness..."

Although China&#39;s air quality in winter is still not good enough, it has improved significantly compared to the past, at least to a level that people can tolerate.

These actions include: using technical means to improve power plants and factory emissions, vigorously developing renewable energy, and electrifying cars.

4109,2024-11-19T22:15:07Z,Salute to you for splitting the facts
4110,2024-11-19T21:52:43Z,Delhi is over crowded. People should move out of Delhi to less crowded towns. This is one way to improve your health.
4111,2024-11-19T20:23:56Z,"Mrs. Palki I always love to hear you always, but i I would rather blame it to sufferer, as you highlight to not choose the govt right or to choose a right govt. however most importantly i have few thoughts of why system failing, i hope @palki you read it:1. why cant we make it authentic and easy KYC process to get the voting conversion from state to state and city to city. if we do it right atleast i  don&#39;t see much flaw there. its will help increasing voting percentage.2. Not every individual is responsible for this pollution.. identification and instead of commission but a simple policy of national government shall resolve it, that is to make vote is mandatory, make policy to be supported by organizations, based on aadhar and current registered address. I live in Bangalore and surprise to see any loan can be given here on base on rental agreement, however in rest of world rental agreement is not authorize document.it will help solve the problem by helping legitimate voters to question the government to resolve the problem.3. Vote should be either digitize, also to get nationally supported within all states online(may result in faking, but to our surprise world best credit card companies do online full verification like Ame.. can we do online verification like CC companies) why dont govt allow a good verification process.10-20 % of working voter moved out of state for earning and wont just come back for voting.at last we live in digital world, trust on legacy system, believe in orthodoxic process of voting. i request you to highlight if possible.. that the freebees are still in nest... the real impacted generation left the nest to build more coz of legacy system.."
4112,2024-11-19T20:21:23Z,Understand the pain but how many people in Delhi lit fire crackers this Diwali even though it’s illegal? How many won’t go to work on a two wheeler instead of a car even though there is only one or two people in the car? People have to help as well. The same signs are shown in Gujarat but people here are just so selfish and don’t think about nature. They are so happy to see the large shining roads built after cutting down millions of trees. Once I expressed I was upset that they cut down so many trees to expand the road and the people were like I’m happy they cut them down because I was getting stuck in traffic and getting late.  just makes me even more sad.
4113,2024-11-19T19:53:17Z,"The funny thing is any kind of outrage towards pollution or the govt. is in social media only. 9 our of 10 are roaming without a mask in Delhi. When I walk around wearing a mask, ppl stare at me with some kind of suspicion It doesnt matter to the public (well the majority of them) because they cant see the bad effects on their health. We need vast number of public awareness and raise voice against the Govt. Like Palki said, its time some good men drag the Govt. to the court."
4114,2024-11-19T19:26:56Z,There are a lot of serious issues that need to be addressed by the government and people together rather to encourage fight Hindu vs Muslim
4115,2024-11-19T19:25:51Z,"1,700? Is this possible? Someone told me on another video that New Delhi reached 700. I remember several years ago when the News said New Delhi had an AQI 1,000 around the same time of the year because of several converging factors including farmers were burning off excess crops, industrial pollution, and lack of rain. Anyway, I remember Beijing used to get to 500-700 regularly in the 2010s before the renewable energy boom, and China switching from coal to cleaning burning natural gas and nuclear. I think this is a phase every developing country has to go through before transitioning. South Asia&#39;s problem might be exacerbated by having the highest population density in the world."

4178,2024-11-19T15:05:44Z,It is basically the large population and all the activities that people do which led to this pollution the only way out is to reduce everything by half whether it is population Industries construction and anything
4179,2024-11-19T14:57:02Z,I cannot understand how any government would not take this more seriously. They put themselves and their own families at risk too.Citizens need to wake up and realize their government doesn&#39;t care enough to make this stuff stop.Vote them out and put somebody in place That will do something about it.
4180,2024-11-19T14:56:28Z,"Maybe instead of wasting peoples taxes and confiscating their private vehicles (can bet my ass car companies lobbied that 15 year policy) , if they did something about the factories and the farms it wouldn&#39;t be so bad now would it.

It&#39;s a shame and pathetic to see India&#39;s capital in this condition at this rate Delhi will die. AQI is not just a number it&#39;s a tick tick for the public to now at least now speak about pollution and environment. Actually it&#39;s not a solution to stay indoors or anything it&#39;s a serious issue, and I&#39;m also so sick of ministers blaming eachother or other states for pollution.And the recent event &quot;Yamuna&quot; filled with toxic foams and people are still use it for religious purposes like I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s wrong but as long as you&#39;ll compromise with these issues politicians will just seems it like a Joke.

4228,2024-11-19T12:43:51Z,"Citizens also have to take responsibility. We can&#39;t always blame the government. People use plastics and burn them, and they use cars and bikes even for walkable distances. There&#39;s too much politics and too little humanity and patriotism. Patriotism also means love for the country&#39;s nature and environment, not just supporting the Indian cricket team."
4229,2024-11-19T12:40:07Z,"Central Government is well aware of cause of this trauma every year but they want us to believe they are doing something to normalise the situation. All across Delhi, construction activities are on-going for creating shopping centres for the big business houses, Govt don&#39;t want to disturb these activities because govt is sold out to them. They pay govt for spending billions into election. Till such time this nexus between govt and big business house is broken we will continue to face this situation."
4230,2024-11-19T12:39:52Z,Please do your research before publishing a report. There’s more to this story and i’m shocked so many smart reporters are missing this fact. The AQI in delhi is above a 1000. What is published by the weather department is nAQI which is normalized AQI. The maximum it can go is 500. Even if the AQI is 50000 nAQI will still max out at 500. It is a statistical measure and the people are being fooled.
4231,2024-11-19T12:37:56Z,"Guys I am a bjp supporter but this is where bjp is punishing us Delhiites for having AAP government. AAP asked the centre government to give ok to artificial rain but the centre denied it without giving any response, any response at all . Are we not being just being punished for exercising our democratic right?"

4237,2024-11-19T12:21:53Z,"No one seems to be working on actual solutions to the problem; instead, it&#39;s all about playing politics. That was a remarkable example of journalism—boldly calling out the wrongdoing while those in charge are busy drafting the next blame game against the opposition. This isn’t just the failure of a political party; it’s the failure of an entire country. It highlights what truly matters versus what doesn&#39;t, as people struggle, suffer, and even lose their lives, while we indulge in lofty dreams of becoming a superpower in the coming years. It’s time to wake up—this massive population cannot continue living under these conditions. As a taxpayer, I can’t help but feel regret; it feels like we&#39;re funding an administration that doesn&#39;t justify the trust we place in it."

4240,2024-11-19T12:10:05Z,"The BJP has miserably failed in urban development and electric public transport investments in urban areas. But to be sure, India is too poor for spending money on urban development especially pollution control measures, which affect Northern India only during winters. Delhi hardly has any large industries. It is really the old transport vehicles and use of cheaper, polluting fuel that is probably responsible. Delhi’s skies are actually pretty blue and clean in rainy months."

4300,2024-11-19T10:12:40Z,"It does not make any sense to compare pollution control measures taken up in Beijing and Shanghai with that in Delhi because India has its unique set of problems. Pollution in Beijing and Shanghai rose due to rise in uncontrolled industrial activitied, but with rise in wealth those industries either were relocated or adopted more environment-friendly technologies and measures under strict vigilance of unitary authoritarian government- if awareness campaign and educating the masses failed to yiekd cooperation from them, threat of state violence would certainly yield. Presence of particulate matter in much of north Indian plains has been historically on the higher side relatively due to semi arid nature of soil with powder-like dirt from the open fields carried by the air, Himalayan mountain ranges acting like a natural barrier hindering polluted air from getting swept off which is exaceberated by stagnant air and weak north-westerly monsoon wind in the winter. On top of that lack of communication and rather confrontation among governments run by different political parties most often at loggerheads for ekectoral dividends under federal structure in a multiparty demicracy complicate the problem. Now add to that the unbrudled human action and explore reasons behind that- stubble burning by self-entitled irresponsible semi-literate farmers for short term unburdening of financial loss and they are prone to rioting and also constitute votebank; industrialisation in a developing economy with much lower GDP per capita that on top of corruption and lack of united political will, leads to limited budgetary capacity when it comes to efficient enforcement of law and order, vigilance on pollution control measures by industries, construction sector, transport and businesses and large scale implementation of technological solutions for alternative energy and emission control. India&#39;s GDP per capita is almost one fifth of China&#39;s- with that kind of GDP per capita, China&#39;s industries used to pollute a hell lot 17-18 years back. China also has a cap on migration of chinese people into major cities and financial hubs like Beijing and Shanghai from elsewhere in the country unlike in India where low income groups flock in hordes from neighboring poor states (where GDP per capita hovers between on third and less than half of national average) to a brownfield megacity like Delhi for blue collar jobs in unorganised sectors as lot of such economic activities occur in such cities and these people can not afford cleaner energy solutions for their livelihood (like many of them still burn coal for cooking purposes; even many restaurants in urban India use coal for Tandoors).  India&#39;s pollution problems are more complicated than China&#39;s and immediate substantial curbing at India&#39;s current level of financial capacity would only be possible by certain actions imposed by India&#39;s central government that would be ipso facto dubbed by India&#39;s political opposition and global media as fascistic, undemocratic, authoritarian, dictatorial, reactionary, nondelegated, impingement on India&#39;s federal structure, anti-poor, would hinder economic growth in the short to mid term with businesses shutting down and people losing their jobs and livelihood that in turn would lead to violent protests and riots fomented by politucal brigades with vested interests of returning to power at the center and would be stoked by a milieu of external forces in furthering their own agenda against India. This would be a vicious cycle of no guaranteed succesd given the upjill task but assured chaos and turmoil throughout the country. Are you prepared for that?"

Even if the government had genuine interest in solving it, (which they clearly don&#39;t at this point) this isn&#39;t an easy fix. Years of substandard construction practices, rampant violation of environmental laws, and total disregard for nature among the majority of the Indian population are just a few contributing factors. The AQI in my hometown Patna was above 300 today, and yet there was massive burning of trash within the city limits in some of the most affluent areas. My fellow countrymen and women, keep your heads down and accept we have failed to keep the MAJORITY of our country clean. Acceptance is the first step. Please don&#39;t defend this situation and compare it with other cities like Lahore; it does no good. Unless this becomes an election issue, nothing will change."

4453,2024-11-19T06:30:06Z,18% Gst for air purifier was personal
4454,2024-11-19T06:28:28Z,"If you feel the urge to rub your eyes frequently or if your voice is turning hoarse mid-speech, you can thank the present air for it. It&#39;s the same scenario year after year. And it strikes like a clockwork, both in terms of the time of arrival and the impact (AQI always breaches the &quot;severe&quot; category mark) and yet nothing changes except for 20-25 days of annual hue and cry. Btw, we use watered-down version of AQI (NAQI) from that of the western standards (such as: US-EPA). We&#39;re already working on a compromised normal. Because apparently when too many people imply &quot;it&#39;s okay, chalta hai&quot; to unacceptable things, they become normal. That&#39;s how quality of life comes down eventually. This is reflected from the trend of people increasingly willing to shell out extra in the name of getting &quot;pure/organic/chemically untreated&quot; edibles from the market as if purity should be a trait of luxury?Anyway, I recently read that the DPCC chairman refused to give a go ahead to a study by IIT-D to gauge real time sources of pollution in the city. On the other hand, expensive but not very efficient smog towers are lying defunct in central Delhi. Wonder whether consultations were made with the field experts for this project or not. Straw burning from Punjab and Haryana has become more of a mayhem in recent years because this particular agri cycle has been shifted to Oct-Nov by farmers due to groundwater issues in pre-monsoon season. If govt. had the political will or intent, it could&#39;ve provided some incentives to promote mechanised disposal of straw or linked MSP to straw procurement from farmers but apparently that won&#39;t turn out to be a vote-magnet like the electricity freebie. So the truth is, the population at large is also to be blamed for it. But the bigger truth is, there&#39;s a larger section of voting population that would choose these freebies over long term solutions for matters such as this. The demographic diversity is such. This, coupled with the fact that the NCR region is a densely populated urban island with several manufacturing industries operating in its satellite cities only add to the problem. But unfortunately the perils are borne by everyone. This makes clean air a luxury in this part of the country. Politicians will always reach for low hanging fruits (short term solutions like GRAP measures) instead of study backed long term solutions that require dedicated investment or best practices which are sustainable year round and also effective rather than disruptive decrees like odd-even rule, or half-hearted measures like closing schools for children upto a certain grade. Government just tries to bide time somehow because they know it&#39;s an issue that&#39;ll recede in 40-45 days but people tend to underscore the fact that it&#39;s an annual affair and even short-term but continous exposure can spur health issues. The ill-effects of polluted air surface gradually and since most of us have memory of a goldfish when it comes to intermittent societal problems (however grave they may be), all is forgotten too soon.Until the better part of the population becomes functional enough to both demand things with a vision and be vociferous enough to let the public representatives know of the same, citizens will just remain a number...a statistic for the electorate. And this fact cuts across party lines so there&#39;s no politics here. But the irony is that once we become functional enough on that level, we buy air purifiers for our home, stay put (&#39;coz now many of us can work from our homes or if not, then work in AC offices), order things from q-commerce and get along with our cocooned lives. Now we don&#39;t have time for the political crap. But the show goes on...because the show always goes on : )"

Please keep in mind that your life and that of your parents and children are on the line here, Please take action."
4457,2024-11-19T06:27:11Z,People of Delhi need to protest for this. And not for junky things like MSP or CAA or whatever trash political agenda. New borns in Delhi don’t even know their life is being cut because their parent generation is so deep into mental corruption that they have forgotten about basic survival attitude.

Earlier this week, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) predicted that Air Quality Index (AQI) will be “very poor” in the coming days, with Delhi’s AQI expected to hover between 400 and 500. AQI of 0-50 is considered good, and 51-100 satisfactory. The Air Quality Index (AQI) scal 51-100 (satisfactory), 101-200 (moderate), 201-300 (poor), 301-400 (very poor), and 401-500 (severe).“The pollution in Delhi this time of the year is deadly &amp; frustrating,”Dr Naresh Trehan, CMD of Medanta Hospital, Gurgaon. “I can tell just by looking at a patient’ s lungs whether they live in the city or near the Oceans,” he says, noting that the lungs of Delhi-NCR residents often turn dark grey or black. He says the accumulation of particulate matter—tiny particles suspended in the air—in lungs severely reduces their capacity to absorb oxygen, leading to conditions like emphysema &amp; asthma.  “Toxic gases also pose a danger to brain tissues,” this increases the chances of the Hemorrhagic stroke or cerebral hemorrhage.𝓢𝓽𝓪𝔂 𝓪𝓵𝓲𝓰𝓷𝓮𝓭 𝓽𝓸 𝓚𝓪𝓲𝔂𝓪𝓷𝓪𝓪𝓽, 𝓢𝓽𝓪𝔂 𝓖𝓻𝓸𝓾𝓷𝓭𝓮𝓭.

Let us deal with some hard numbers to set the Context. At present, there are 1.38 million new cases of cancer in India. As many as 1,392,179 people in India had cancer in 2020, according to a global oncology report.According to another report, cancer cases in India increased at an average annual rate of 2 per cent between 2010 &amp; 2019. Cancer cases have doubled in just three years. Deaths from cancer in the country also went up at an average rate of 0.1 to 1 per cent in the same period.To add to the concern, India&#39;s growth rates for cancer are among the highest globally, making India an unenviable candidate for being the cancer capital of the world.Around 80 to 85 per cent of cancer cases in India are related to extreme air, water pollution&amp; tobacco products.Four hundred Indian women die from cervical cancer every day. The top four cancersraging in India includes breast, cervix, lungs &amp; oral. However, many of the most common types of cancer affecting India are preventable cancers. Clean air &amp; water, non pesticide food, Early detection &amp; subsequent prevention policies &amp; programmes can stem this deluge before it turns into a tsunami of monstrous proportions.We need dedicated social workers &amp; paramedics as well as government subsidiesSubsidising essential cancer screening programme payments can be an important part of the cancer prevention mechanismcost? Emotions and ethics apart, purely from a business standpoint, preventing cancer among millions of underprivileged Indians will probably add more value to the economy than buildingCorporate hospitals that mostIndians cannot afford.This brings us to clean air, water pollution, non pesticide food &amp; tobacco usage. The scourge that continues to inflict carnage onIndian cities, despite statutory warnings, roadside hoardings &amp; media advertisements and updates of air quality across cities. How about taking it to the next level &amp; documenting the adverse effects of air, water pollution, deadly effects of pesticide loaded food, tobacco chewing &amp; nicotinesmoking as part of national school curricula? How about routine oral check ups &amp; lung cancer screening for those at risk?At the end of the day, what are we trying to accomplish? We are trying to create a mindset of awareness where early detection &amp; warning signs, timely screenings &amp; subsequent prevention become the fulcrum of cancer management.In short, it&#39;s life-saving to nip cancer in the bud. Cities of India have become a ticking time bomb when it comes to deadly life threatening disease directly related to air, water &amp; pesticides related pollution. Finally it&#39;s never the governments but individuals who got to safeguard their families health &amp; lives. Be Brave. Be free. Take the decisions. It&#39;s 100% in your hands.

This isn’t just a statistic, this is the reality of what flows through our river. It carries waste &amp; toxic chemicals that endanger not just the river but also the health &amp; livelihood of millions who rely on it for water &amp; agriculture.The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has raised serious concerns time &amp; again over the performance of sewage treatment plants, and yet the authorities have not taken accountability. Leaders have promised to clean the Yamuna, yet the situation continues to worsen. Despite several court orders, the development on the Yamuna action plan is negligible on the ground. The river continues to be a drain of toxic sewage &amp; pollutants in the national capital despite the political rhetoric played around it.Rivers of India are under dire threat from pollution that threatens their very existence. Rissala Polo has raised concerns at the highest levels continuously for years. Until each one does not understand &amp; spreads the knowledge nothing seems to move. Your support is now crucial in demanding immediate action to stop the toxic waste, untreated sewage, &amp; industrial pollutants poisoning the rivers.Just as the 400 rivers of India have sustained life for years, it is now our responsibility to fight for their survival. Public specially youngestors voice is powerful, &amp; with your help, we can push for change &amp; hold the authorities accountable to restore these lifelines.The importance of immediate action in this matter cannot be emphasized enough. If we Indians fail to act now, we are not only allowing this pollution to persist but also contributing to the doom of life. Kaiynaat shall not pardon us humans.Raise you voice to protect the rivers from the pollution that threatens their very existence. Rissala Polo has fought &amp; highlighted the dangers for years.  It is now an extreme emergency of dire proportions &amp; consequences Each Indians support is a crucial step in demanding immediate action to stop the toxic waste, untreated sewage, &amp; industrial pollutants poisoning the rivers of the country.The air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat and the future of our cities are all at stake. Without immediate action, the environment will continue to suffer from the impact of this unchecked pollution. As far as Air quality, unplanned construction, overcrowded spaces, soil health, noise &amp; underground water quality is concerned, it&#39;s toxic to beyond repair standards. Every third Indian shall be suffering from cancer by 2030. 100% NCR residents lungs are functional at 60% capacity. All hope is lost &amp; climate migration has already begun.The Yamuna River, the longest tributary of river Ganga, which many of us hold dear &amp; sacred, has become a tragic reflection of neglect. The toxic froth on the Yamuna is a dangerous mix of untreated sewage, industrial waste, &amp; harmful chemicals, a stark reminder of the river’s severe pollution &amp; its threat to our health. What makes this even more alarming is that the Yamuna supplies 80% of Delhi&#39;s water &amp; supports countless families who rely on it for irrigation &amp; daily use. Once a source of life, the Yamuna is now dying right in front of us in the capital of our country, emitting a persistent foul smell.The River, so sacred to us, is in serious trouble. It’s a lifeline for Delhi-NCR, providing 80% of the city’s water supply, essential for everyday use for millions of people. It irrigates the crops that feed us and supports countless families who rely on it for their livelihoods. What was once a vital source of life and community is now filled with toxic foam, sewage, &amp; industrial waste, putting our health, food, &amp; future in grave danger. Non action has ensured irreversible damage to the Yamuna.Fishermen are still rowing through these hazardous waters, risking their health to earn a living. The Yamuna, once a life-giving force, is now choked with waste that makes it unsafe for bathing, irrigation, &amp; essential daily use.Just as the Yamuna has sustained life for years, it is now our responsibility to fight for its survival. Your voice is powerful, &amp; with your help, we can push for change &amp; hold the authorities accountable to restore these lifelines. We urge the Government of India to take immediate action to safeguard the health &amp; future of our Rivers. We must act now - before more damage is done and trust in the system&#39;s ability to protect our environment is irreparably damaged. Let&#39;s share, educate and demand action from everyone who matters. All for whom we have voted and elected. 𝓢𝓽𝓪𝔂 𝓪𝓵𝓲𝓰𝓷𝓮𝓭 𝓽𝓸 𝓚𝓪𝓲𝔂𝓪𝓷𝓪𝓪𝓽, 𝓢𝓽𝓪𝔂 𝓖𝓻𝓸𝓾𝓷𝓭𝓮𝓭. 𝓦𝓲𝓼𝓱 𝔂𝓸𝓾 𝓑𝓻𝓪𝓿𝓮𝓻𝔂, 𝓗𝓮𝓪𝓵𝓽𝓱 &amp; 𝓕𝓻𝓮𝓮𝓭𝓸𝓶.

Delhi was the most polluted city in the country in Oct with an average PM2.5 concentration of 111 micrograms per cubic metre, followed by Ghaziabad at 110 and Muzaffarnagar at 103. CREA monitored 263 cities in the country, whose pollution data on continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations was available for 80% of the year&#39;s days.According to the analysis, Ghaziabad, Muzaffarnagar, Hapur, Noida, Meerut, Charkhi Dadri, Greater Noida, Gurgaon and Bahadurgarh, all NCR cities, were identified as the second to tenth most polluted cities in India. &quot;This alarming ranking persists despite the implementation of the Graded Response Action Plan, which has been in effect since Oct 15,&quot; said CREA.&quot;With the exception of Delhi, all other megacities such as Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru managed to maintain PM2.5 values below the national standard in Oct,&quot; said CREA.CREA added that for the first time this year, Uttar Pradesh dominated the list of India&#39;s top 10 most polluted cities, with six cities in the state making the list, followed by three from Haryana. All these 10 cities recorded PM2.5 levels way higher than the daily national ambient air quality standard of 60 micrograms per cubic metre and WHO&#39;s daily safe guideline of 15 micrograms per cubic metre.𝓣𝓱𝓮 𝓡𝓲𝓼𝓼𝓪𝓵𝓪.: Air pollution is indeed deadly, posing one of the greatest global health threats today. With harmful pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide saturating the air, millions of people are exposed to invisible toxins everyday. Speaking of pollution, One Asian city has recorded an alarming Air Quality Index (AQI) of 1,165 on Wednesday, as per Swiss air quality monitoring group IQAir, which aggregates data from 14 regional monitoring stations. This level is over 120 times higher than the air quality standards recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO)."

4649,2024-11-19T03:18:27Z,What amazes me is how few people use air purifiers in India. When I visited New Delhi no one seemed to use this so they are just breathing this terrible air. If you have a child its even worse. When I visit Thailand or China air purifiers are quite common and their air is nowhere near as bad as Indias.

Future of India is all about water problem and pollution due to overpopulation. Giving permissions to unlimited houses,  unlimited vehicles to be sold was planned 60 to 70 years ago and the dream has come true. To see most of the population unemployed , food prices to sky rocket is the second dream of all Indian governments. India needs more freebies to achieve all these dreams before 2030.Delhi is 14 Times more densely populated than Beijing. We have to become at least 30 times denser than Beijing by 2040. More reservations more freebies more children is the only way to achieve this.We need more children we need more freebies, we have to achieve two billion population soon as possible"

By every measure possible, we lack total basic civic sense, respect towards others, respect towards nation (not just flag), and respect towards rule of law,  yet very proud to be indians or hindu. we vote for our caste members, we encourage bribing if it&#39;s a quick fix, and we are too religious (EVERY FNKN RELIGION!). Things need to change drastically, or we are going to miss a golden opportunity as our country gets more older population by the year 2055 or something. WAKE UP!

They don&#39;t have any solution whatsoever; What more evidence you need, it&#39;s all there for everyone to see it. Yet, Indian masses are brainwashed to not think, talk, raise questions about their basic quality of life problems.

4987,2024-11-18T04:52:56Z,During  COP29 UN  New Delhi Air Pollution matter is  addressed.  Further Air quality index is above 500 now What are the steps  New Delhi Government   is taking  to stop Air Pollution .
4988,2024-11-18T04:52:10Z,"If you feel the urge to rub your eyes frequently or if your voice is turning hoarse mid-speech, you can thank the present air for it. It&#39;s the same scenario year after year. And it strikes like a clockwork, both in terms of the time of arrival and the impact (AQI always breaches the &quot;severe&quot; category mark) and yet nothing changes except for 20-25 days of annual hue and cry. Btw, we use watered-down version of AQI (NAQI) from that of the western standards (such as: US-EPA). We&#39;re already working on a compromised normal. Because apparently when too many people imply &quot;it&#39;s okay, chalta hai&quot; to unacceptable things, they become normal. That&#39;s how quality of life comes down eventually. This is reflected from the trend of people increasingly willing to shell out extra in the name of getting &quot;pure/organic/chemically untreated&quot; edibles from the market as if purity should be a trait of luxury?Anyway, I recently read that the DPCC chairman refused to give a go ahead to a study by IIT-D to gauge real time sources of pollution in the city. On the other ahead, expensive but not very efficient smog towers are lying defunct in central Delhi. Wonder whether consultations were made with the field experts for this project or not. Straw burning from Punjab and Haryana has become more of a mayhem in recent years because this particular agri cycle has been shifted to Oct-Nov by farmers due to groundwater issues in pre-monsoon season. If govt. had the political will or intent, it could&#39;ve provided some incentives to promote mechanised disposal of straw or linked MSP to straw procurement from farmers but apparently that won&#39;t turn out to be a vote-magnet like the electricity freebie. So the truth is, the population at large is also to be blamed for it. But the bigger truth is, there&#39;s a larger section of voting population that would choose these freebies over long term solutions for matters such as this. The demographic diversity is such. This, coupled with the fact that the NCR region is a densely populated urban island with several manufacturing industries operating in its satellite cities only add to the problem. But unfortunately the perils are borne by everyone. This makes clean air a luxury in this part of the country. Politicians will always reach for low hanging fruits (short term solutions like GRAP measures) instead of study backed long term solutions that require dedicated investment or best practices which are sustainable year round and also effective rather than disruptive decrees like odd-even rule, or half-hearted measures like closing schools for children upto a certain grade. Government just tries to bide time somehow because they know it&#39;s an issue that&#39;ll recede in 40-45 days but people tend to underscore the fact that it&#39;s an annual affair and even short-term but continous exposure can spur health issues. The ill-effects of polluted air surface gradually but since most of us have memory of a goldfish when it comes to intermittent societal problems (however grave they may be), all is forgotten too soon.Until the better part of the population becomes functional enough to both demand things with a vision and be vociferous enough to let the public representatives know of the same, citizens will just remain a number...a statistic for the electorate. And this fact cuts across party lines so there&#39;s no politics here. But the irony is that once we become functional enough on that level, we buy air purifiers for our home, stay put (&#39;coz now many of us can work from our homes or if not, then work in AC offices), order things from q-commerce and get along with our cocooned lives. Now we don&#39;t have time for the political crap. But the show goes on...because the show always goes on : )"

4990,2024-11-18T00:49:01Z,"Over last 25+ yrs, India&#39;s leaders, government, administration, governance, policy making has been a disaster in general and specifically for environment, quality of life and other basic human index parameters. They don&#39;t have any solution whatsoever; What more evidence you need, it&#39;s all the there for everyone to see it. Yet, Indian masses are brainwashed to not think, talk, raise questions about their basic quality of life problems.  Even if the pollution levels rises to 100 times the safe limits, not a single soul will raise their voice and will keep on living and suffering silently in the gas chambers and keep on paying taxes. No wonder invaders were able to colonize India for 1000 of years."

North Indian plain having natural barrier in the form of Himalayas, very low-speed to stagnant wind in winter, semi arid soil nature throughout vastness of much of north Indian plains containing powderlike dirt that is carried by air, air pollution due to stubble burning by farmers in Pakistan as well  (not just in Punjab, Haryana, western UP) which India can not possibly clamp down upon, ground reality of low income groups from neighboring poor states of UP and Bihar migrating for blue collar, unorganised jobs to a brownfield megacity who on their own can not afford expensive technological intervention into their energy needs, poor communication and lack of cooperation between state governments run by political parties most often at loggerheads, planning and plotting against each other, cutting their own nose to spite their competitors in a multiparty democracy and paucity in enough funds to introduce alternative technological solutions for green energy, vigilance, enforcement of law and order on riot-prone mob are some of the issues plaguing Delhi and running EV buses, metros and closing down coal-fired power plants are not a permanent solution although they can provide some relief for the short term. Eother authoritarian power has to be exerted to resolve issues caused by human actions or we should be prepared to let Delhi resolve its issues at its own comfortable pace commensurate with India&#39;s economic growth at the expense of heath, enviormental degradation and loss in economic opportunities. India needs to relocate its national capital at the earliest to a greenfield population-controlled smart city with 1 millioninhabitation capacity on high ground with abundant river water in a geostrategic location somewhere in Central India (in states like MP, north eastern MH, western Chattisgarh or north western Telengana) like say, in a place like Paachmarhi in order to sustain smooth functioning of the cebteal government."

5138,2024-11-15T10:43:58Z,"&quot;Delhi&#39;s pollution crisis is a classic example of putting too many eggs in one basket. Despite having adequate infrastructure, people suffer daily due to unbearable traffic jams, lack of parking, overcrowded roads, inadequate public transport, and rising pollution levels. Adding to this is the lack of civic sense among citizens, further worsening the chaos.Take the period between Deepavali and Chhath Puja as an example — roads are empty, and pollution levels drop significantly. This proves how much of Delhi’s population is migrant. So why can’t the government take bold steps to decentralize? Shift non-essential offices and organizations to smaller towns across India.Delhi, as the capital, can host essential offices, but the rest can operate from anywhere, just as ISRO thrives in Bangalore and successfully launched Chandrayaan. Pilani, a remote Rajasthan village, earned global recognition with BITS. Decentralization will not only reduce the pressure on Delhi but also foster development in smaller towns. Bold action is overdue — decentralize, redistribute, and relieve Delhi.&quot;#DelhiPollution #DecentralizeDevelopment #SustainableGrowth"

5152,2024-11-15T09:54:53Z,Fake news. Delhi is the best.
5153,2024-11-15T09:50:50Z,"You’ve touched on a complex issue that involves a mix of urbanization, commercialization, governance, and environmental factors. Delhi’s pollution is a multifaceted problem with multiple contributors, as you rightly pointed out. Let’s break down the issues you raised:1. Excessive Commercialization and OverpopulationDelhi, as the capital of India, has seen rapid urbanization and commercialization over the last few decades. This has led to an influx of people from all parts of the country seeking better employment opportunities, education, and access to resources like electricity and water. The migration often results in overcrowding, straining existing infrastructure and resources, and further contributing to pollution.Increased vehicle numbers: More people mean more vehicles on the roads, leading to traffic congestion, longer idling times, and higher emissions. The constant influx of people means more construction and more demand for services, which intensifies the pollution problem.Strain on resources: The demand for free electricity and water can put a significant strain on the resources of the city, leading to overexploitation, which has its own environmental cost. At times, there’s also excessive use of diesel generators due to power shortages, contributing further to air pollution.2. Illegal or Legal Hawkers on FootpathsStreet vendors, whether legal or illegal, occupy large parts of Delhi’s footpaths. This creates several problems:Obstruction of footpaths: When hawkers occupy footpaths, pedestrians are forced onto roads, which causes congestion and often leads to more vehicles stopping unnecessarily on roads. This also results in traffic snarls and increases fuel consumption and emissions from idling cars.Air and noise pollution: Many hawkers use makeshift stoves and generators to power their stalls, which can contribute to air pollution. The noise generated by the crowded areas, along with the idling vehicles, adds to the pollution burden.Waste generation: Vendors, especially food vendors, often create a lot of waste, some of which is not disposed of properly. This leads to littering and contributes to the pollution, especially around busy markets and commercial areas.3. Unnecessary Construction and Infrastructure DevelopmentThe issue of unchecked construction is another significant driver of pollution. Authorities sometimes approve projects that are poorly planned or unnecessary, often driven by the interests of contractors and real estate developers.Dust and particulate matter: Construction activities, especially when not managed well, release large amounts of dust and particulate matter into the air, which directly impacts air quality. This is particularly damaging to health, as PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) levels increase, which are linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.Encroachment and disruption: Unnecessary construction projects often lead to the encroachment of green spaces and open areas. Trees and vegetation, which act as natural filters for pollutants, are cleared for buildings, roads, or commercial complexes. This reduces the city’s capacity to absorb air pollutants.Disruptions and inefficiencies: Construction activities can disrupt traffic, increase congestion, and lead to longer travel times. These inefficiencies in urban planning add to the pollution by increasing fuel consumption and emissions.4. Government Policies and EnforcementWhile the government has made efforts to address pollution through various measures like vehicle emission standards, odd-even schemes, promoting electric vehicles, and improving public transportation, enforcement remains a challenge.Lack of enforcement: Even though laws exist to regulate hawkers, vehicle emissions, construction activities, and waste management, enforcement is often weak. Political and bureaucratic challenges often result in poor implementation of these laws, leading to more pollution.Short-term solutions: Many policies address the symptoms rather than the root causes. For instance, initiatives like the odd-even rule or the shutting down of industries for a few days may reduce pollution temporarily but fail to address the long-term structural causes.Solutions and Way ForwardThere’s no single solution, but a combination of strategies could help alleviate the problem:Urban Planning: Better urban planning, with a focus on sustainable growth, efficient public transportation, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, could reduce congestion and pollution. Zoning regulations should be enforced more strictly to ensure that commercial activity doesn’t spill over into public spaces like footpaths.Hawker Regulation: Rather than cracking down on hawkers, the government could look at creating designated spaces for them where they don’t obstruct footpaths or roads. This would reduce congestion and ensure that street vendors are able to work without contributing to pollution.Construction Oversight: Stricter oversight and regulation of construction projects, ensuring that they follow environmental norms and manage dust pollution effectively, would help mitigate the environmental impact.Awareness Campaigns: Public awareness campaigns can encourage people to reduce their reliance on private vehicles, use public transport, and adopt more eco-friendly practices.Greening Delhi: The government could invest in increasing green spaces, promoting rooftop gardens, and planting more trees to help absorb pollutants and provide a buffer against heat and dust.Delhi’s pollution is undoubtedly a significant challenge, but a more coordinated and holistic approach could reduce its impact. As with many urban issues, tackling the problem requires the collaboration of citizens, businesses, and the government to create a healthier, more sustainable city."

Vehicles are there all year round irrespective of the time of the year. The main cause is known by every politician but the vote bank will suffer if those policies are implemented to control the stubble burning. On top of all this, the Supreme Court reprimands the state government every year for all this. Committees are formed, GRAP is implemented yet it repeats the next year. Why? Because this country is a joke irrespective of the city. Even the Supreme Court can&#39;t take any action against the leaders and all the so called IAS officers who should be working to fix these. It&#39;s pathetic and it will remain pathetic because the people who are aware of all these things constitute a small part of the population. The majority chunk is poor and the votes are sold during election campaigns. If there are people who actually think we&#39;ll become a superpower one day, you are living in a distant dream."

It was terrifying to witness.Whatever needs to be done, electrifying vehicles are not necessarily the answer, as it burns more fossil fuels to manufacture these electric cars, which makes them potentially more environmentally unfriendly than a regular car. Plus, the cars might not be emitting exhaust directly when you drive them, but the electricity with which you recharge the battery often burns fossil fuels, as they are energy-intensive.Think batteries, think environmental degradation and exploitation."

5288,2024-11-15T02:51:02Z,"My dear wife, 20 years ago when I went to school in Beijing, when there was no wind, it was similar to Delhi now, and the wind was even worse, and the sky was full of sand. It&#39;s all good now. palki, should go to China for a month series to see what India should learn and also welcome criticism of our shortcomings. I mean well."
5289,2024-11-15T02:50:02Z,Indian authorities never tried to control pollution. First step towards these should stop all kinds of firecrackers
5290,2024-11-15T02:44:13Z,People’s health is degrading and all she can talk about is the bad image it is creating?
5291,2024-11-15T02:41:00Z,"Overpopulation will never be mitigated because more population means more votes, more people means cheaper human labour for 1st world countries, no one in this godforsaken country talks about clumate change or population control."
5292,2024-11-15T02:34:30Z,"Nature is giving a PIL to the Supreme seat of justice in this country! It warns, &#39;don&#39;t fumble with letters of the Constitution alone. Things have moved far beyond that. &#39;"
5293,2024-11-15T02:31:56Z,Looks like more chinese bots are here any way this may be reduced by big air filters more public transport more EVs etc
5294,2024-11-15T02:27:01Z,"Still people want to burst crackers, burn stubble."
5295,2024-11-15T02:22:51Z,"She is doing news because delhi govt is not bjp her office noida is also highly polluted she doesnt news , godi media palki."
5296,2024-11-15T02:19:20Z,"This is what India should focus on vs defense.  Pollution is costing India a lot more than anything else.  My country, USA, should learn from India of what NOT to do."
5297,2024-11-15T02:17:05Z,"MORE TREES, MORE EV VEHICLES ARE NEEDED ASAP"
5298,2024-11-15T02:14:34Z,"When you have two Govts in Delhi, Union Govt and State Govt, and no one to take care of us. There is no emergency mindset in the govt at all. We have to suffer."
5299,2024-11-15T02:12:29Z,Pollution is Nehru&#39;s fault
5300,2024-11-15T02:11:55Z,Result of clear over population. Delhi is one of the most densely populated places on Earth. More than 50% of the population in India does not contribute to its economy yet India gives free bees to increase its population to make everyone&#39;s life hell. We are at least 7-8 times more than the resources we have  ( water &amp; jobs ) and all problems in India because of over population
5301,2024-11-15T02:07:54Z,"We can&#39;t plant tress, we cant make our surroundings clean, nobody cares in Delhi specially.Almost every single person wants to buy  and most of them having their own.Atleast per person who is buying any vehicle he should be responsible to plant a tree."
5302,2024-11-15T02:02:07Z,Now we feel how trees are very  important
5303,2024-11-15T02:00:13Z,"It&#39;s impossible to reach to any solution in India because of its people. You point a problem, it will hurt their ego and they will point problems back at you. People are not ready to make changes in their life style. You tell them to avoid diwali crackers, you become anti hindu, you try to impose odd even rule, you become a laughing stock. So much so, they argue that it was not made clear if the initial digit has to be even or the last digit has to be even. It&#39;s not just air pollution, it&#39;s about any problem. They prefer problems over solutions and as long as they can complain, who cares."
5304,2024-11-15T01:58:46Z,The actions are simple peoole would change ev instead of using petrol. govt cant do anything small city using large number of population and vehicle
5305,2024-11-15T01:56:17Z,bhikari economy i dont understand where all money goes ? mumbai is second same only people talk about ram and hanuman and collect votes /if this thing is not controllable give delhi sat sunday off and make no vehicles no road policy on weekend   only ev s and hybrid allowed  on weekend / india dows not give any benifit to its citizens atleast give clean air
5306,2024-11-15T01:43:16Z,That is the cost of rejecting Chinese EVs
5307,2024-11-15T01:38:00Z,It&#39;s chinas fault right?
5308,2024-11-15T01:20:59Z,Strong statement &quot;What is the Government doing about the Pollution&quot;.  Hope someone listening and do something
5309,2024-11-15T01:09:38Z,Its shocking to see the state of air pollution in Delhi.  What&#39;s even more shocking is the number of people walking around without a mask.Even more ridiculous is the number of people doing their routine exercise out in the open.  Imagine inhaling all that air which includes air pollutants.  STAY INDOORS WHERE POSSIBLE
5310,2024-11-15T01:06:50Z,"Indian cities and mostly North Indians and western indias cities are all same everywhere littering and full of garbage and they don&#39;t have civic sense . Religious rituals, caste division, corrupted officials , crowded population, unplanned policy, illiterate politicians, Mafia, selfish mindset of the business class and many more are the reasons why india is not clean and tidy."
5311,2024-11-15T00:58:10Z,Wow delhi ..Dont waste our time by showing all this nonsense  ... delhikars are responsible  ...
5312,2024-11-15T00:52:47Z,can barely breathe !

5319,2024-11-14T23:38:13Z,"How can a country progress when the environment people are living in is slowly killing them. Reduced lifespan, strain on healthcare, family dependencies and this in turn has a knock on impact on the economy. How can people build a country when they are choking."
5320,2024-11-14T23:32:21Z,Thanks for raisimg this issue!!!!
5321,2024-11-14T23:22:44Z,"I hope,26th January me jab koi State guest aaya to.Tab aisa pollution hona chahiye.Kyu ki tabhi government ko kuch sharam aae ga,Aur wo isko solve kare ge. Nahi to har saal ye hota hai.Koi permanent sollution nahi nikala.Kuch weeks me ye thoda kam ho jae ga fir log 1 saal ke liye ye bhul jae ge."
5322,2024-11-14T23:21:06Z,over concentration of population in one place

5324,2024-11-14T23:09:02Z,"Take notes from China. Hell, get the government to work directly with China to help assist. I remember they were dealing with the EXACT same issue in Beijing."
5325,2024-11-14T23:07:56Z,Thank u government for Indian capital city is most populated city
5326,2024-11-14T23:07:38Z,Its just fog. China used to have it. Not as much anymore. Dont worry it will pass.
5327,2024-11-14T23:03:19Z,"To combat pollution in India is impossible. Unless population is strictly controlled, pollution shall increase everyday. Population control is the last thing government will do."

5330,2024-11-14T22:36:32Z,Palki can&#39;t hide the shame of Endia anymore.  Just like getting 0 gold medal in Olympic games with the population of 1.4 billion people.
5331,2024-11-14T22:35:59Z,"Solution is Chinese EV cars. Superior, cleaning, affordable. Best in the world."
5332,2024-11-14T22:33:34Z,"First thing first, educate indian not to burst firecrackers. This is at least everybody can do"
5333,2024-11-14T22:32:48Z,"Indian can&#39;t solve pollution problem, yet they think they are the super power."
5334,2024-11-14T22:27:11Z,If the people stopped ing and Pissing in the Streets.
5335,2024-11-14T22:12:54Z,"Pollution ?? Whats that ? We are OK. Honestly. We have elected our representatives and have prayed: &quot;O great, corrupt, selfish leader, lead us from Smog into Total Darkness.&quot; Had this been a problem, then it would have been solved but it continues so people must be OK, happy and thriving. Not sure why Palki Sharma is painting this negative picture."
5336,2024-11-14T21:44:32Z,GOD PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS &quot;AIR POLLUTION&quot; - YOU ARE THE ONLY HOPE FOR MILLIONS
5337,2024-11-14T21:33:21Z,Wow! I&#39;m so surprised Palki Shawarma did not blame China for New Delhi&#39;s Pollution!

5340,2024-11-14T21:08:46Z,"This reminds me of the New Delhi military parade. They planned a a fighter jet and carrier plane show, but all you could see was 2 seconds of a plane&#39;s belly when it was flying right over them."
5341,2024-11-14T21:08:07Z,I feel bad for children who breath this toxic air.
5342,2024-11-14T21:07:49Z,"It’s very disappointing to see that the government is not taking immediate steps to address this situation. Delhi’s pollution is making headlines every day in both national and international media. People are suffering as this pollution takes a serious toll on their health, yet no strict action has been taken even after 15 days. It’s shocking to think that this is happening in Delhi, the capital of the world’s 5th largest economy."
5343,2024-11-14T21:06:09Z,Imagine this pollution is spreading the world. India should keep this pollution to themselves!!
5344,2024-11-14T20:37:31Z,"aam admi party, bjp &amp; other neighbours states are doing nothing to stop this, no one is putting a sincere effort, what a shame.. when u can’t do anything for betterment of the country &amp; it’s people then u are simply betraying the nation &amp; it’s land, nation doesn’t just form saying out loud the national anthem.."

5346,2024-11-14T20:23:58Z,I came to India beginning of this year from Sydney to Chennai. The air was so thick and was hard to breath. Next flight left and ran away  Oh I love my city Sydney  Now I will work for the community
5347,2024-11-14T20:17:36Z,"What? We are not so bad, we are number 2?  Palki settles for number 2?"
5348,2024-11-14T20:14:36Z,Wear Mask I 95 help a lot! It cost a few dollars though
5349,2024-11-14T20:06:51Z,I got a simple solution to this problem: Reduce few vehicles from motorcades of elected officials and use that money to buy tillers and do the free tilling for farmers so they don’t burn the stubble. I hear this is the time the farmers are burning the stubble  since they can’t afford tilling.
5350,2024-11-14T20:00:41Z,Who is responsible for this ?
5351,2024-11-14T19:29:49Z,"i guess enough foreign meets have been done, foreign summits attended.. its high time certain internal severe issues taken up by Modi ji and cabinet with fast actions. stricter laws and punishments required."

5356,2024-11-14T18:43:30Z,The worst thing is that this polluted air flows towards  other countries like Sri Lanka  who did not contributed to Indian pollution.
5357,2024-11-14T18:43:09Z,"Indians and indian  government talk too much about infra structure boom, 5 th largest economy, highest gdp growth, 700 billion us$ reserve and so on and so on...........But nobody cares about pollution, higiene, clealiness, discipline,  insane traffic, chaotic situation of the cities.Shame on indians and shame to governent of india.Absolutely ridículous"
5358,2024-11-14T18:42:52Z,"History seems to be repeating itself when it comes to pollution. Despite numerous instances and warnings, few new innovations or strategies are being implemented. Why is that?"
5359,2024-11-14T18:36:57Z,"Unlike INDIA Modi government China CPC government had to face a real, the best opposition party in the world, the USA. In the years 2005 to 2015, the US embassy in Beijing daily monitor the air quality and the data were relayed by Western media with criticism and attacks on CPC government. The result effect today is very positive. China air pollution drastically reduced without compromising the industrialization progress. Chinese people should be thankful to both the CPC GOVERNMENT and the USA"
5360,2024-11-14T18:32:43Z,Burst more crackers
5361,2024-11-14T18:27:41Z,Atleast first at something other than population

5371,2024-12-17T11:54:30Z,Environmental laws are more for breach than practice
5372,2024-12-03T03:08:52Z,"The reason India is so outspoken about this matter in COP29 is because India thinks that they can get the biggest share of the donation based on population count. Remember, India said they should get a permanent UNSC seat  because they are the most populated country of the world?"
5373,2024-12-03T03:08:34Z,"In di a has no excuses for polluting and harming the environment. They are not the World&#39;s factory, yet, they are producing so much greenhouses gases such as C02. The most overlooked greenhouse gases are methane. If there is research conducted to calculate the amount of methane being released into the atmosphere, |ndia will rank #1. Why? Take a look at how many cows roam on the streets and how much  they littered and were not covered up? Methane gases released into the atmosphere? |n di a needs to be sanctioned!"
5374,2024-12-03T03:08:25Z,"India is acting important on all social medias again. All Indian medias are saying that &quot;India rejected the deal of COP29&quot;? What they do not understand is that the deal was made for all developing countries. The deal wasn&#39;t made exclusively for India. India does not represent all developing countries and hence, they are in no rightful position to reject the deal on behalf of all developing countries. Only the recipient countries, COLLECTIVELY and unanimously, can reject the deal. The title of their news headlines were worded in such a way to make India look important, as if they are the SOLE recipient for the deal and that they call the shots for all developing countries. India wants to look important and wants to be the leader of the Global South or developing countries but has every developing countries or countries of the Global South ever come together and elect a leader? No. India should know its place and stop ttrying so hard."
5375,2024-12-03T03:08:16Z,"The difference between China and India is that when China is down and out and industrializing, they did not demand that the entire world should pay them 1 trillion dollars as climate finance, unlike India, during COP26 held in Glasgow dated November 2021. This is not a one time example. India being the 5th largest economy of the world, has never hosted the Olympic games when they are poor/rich, unlike China. China had voluntarily made a bid to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the right to host the Olympic games in year 2008 when they are poor, and once again in the year of 2022 when they are much wealthier. That is the difference in ethics and culture between these countries. One believes in &quot;the spirit of giving unconditionally&quot; or generosity no matter whether they are rich or poor, the other believes in taking but not sharing/giving. That is Indian culture versus the Chinese culture. Criticize France for as many times as you want, calling them &quot;cheap&quot; or &quot;poor&quot; or &quot;miser&quot; but the fact remains.... France is generous enough to host the Olympic Games free of charge, unlike the #1 extremely superpower (self-proclaimed) on the Internet, India."
5376,2024-12-03T03:08:09Z,"The problems of the entire world, eg. adverse climatical change, isn&#39;t a problem of India but somehow and someway, India&#39;s problem is a problem for the entire world. Hence, India, being the 5th largest economy and a superpower (whether true or self-proclaimed, it does not matter), refused to donate and play a part in &quot;the deal of COP29&quot;? Have you seen this? ‘India needs you’: Priyanka Chopra sets up Covid fundraiser, urges world to donate? Remember the whole world aided India during the pandemic when Indian mishandled the pandemic? Remind me, which country &quot;asked&quot;  for donations/oxygen tanks/ventilators from the entire world because they had mishandled the pandemic? What are &quot;PM CARE FUNDS&quot;? Because At least 4.7 million people died in India due to Covid-19 in 2020 and 2021, the World Health Organization said on Thursday (HindustanTimes) ??"

Like Delhi, Chendu has very slow moving air, the smogs just stay for a very long time. Chinese gov subsidise farmer to collect the stubbles and use machine to chop them instead of burning directly, or even use the stubbles for power plan generating electricity (due to much higher burning temperature, much less pollution generated). That worked pretty well. Maybe India can use the similar solution."

5705,2024-11-15T09:50:14Z,"You’ve touched on a complex issue that involves a mix of urbanization, commercialization, governance, and environmental factors. Delhi’s pollution is a multifaceted problem with multiple contributors, as you rightly pointed out. Let’s break down the issues you raised:1. Excessive Commercialization and OverpopulationDelhi, as the capital of India, has seen rapid urbanization and commercialization over the last few decades. This has led to an influx of people from all parts of the country seeking better employment opportunities, education, and access to resources like electricity and water. The migration often results in overcrowding, straining existing infrastructure and resources, and further contributing to pollution.Increased vehicle numbers: More people mean more vehicles on the roads, leading to traffic congestion, longer idling times, and higher emissions. The constant influx of people means more construction and more demand for services, which intensifies the pollution problem.Strain on resources: The demand for free electricity and water can put a significant strain on the resources of the city, leading to overexploitation, which has its own environmental cost. At times, there’s also excessive use of diesel generators due to power shortages, contributing further to air pollution.2. Illegal or Legal Hawkers on FootpathsStreet vendors, whether legal or illegal, occupy large parts of Delhi’s footpaths. This creates several problems:Obstruction of footpaths: When hawkers occupy footpaths, pedestrians are forced onto roads, which causes congestion and often leads to more vehicles stopping unnecessarily on roads. This also results in traffic snarls and increases fuel consumption and emissions from idling cars.Air and noise pollution: Many hawkers use makeshift stoves and generators to power their stalls, which can contribute to air pollution. The noise generated by the crowded areas, along with the idling vehicles, adds to the pollution burden.Waste generation: Vendors, especially food vendors, often create a lot of waste, some of which is not disposed of properly. This leads to littering and contributes to the pollution, especially around busy markets and commercial areas.3. Unnecessary Construction and Infrastructure DevelopmentThe issue of unchecked construction is another significant driver of pollution. Authorities sometimes approve projects that are poorly planned or unnecessary, often driven by the interests of contractors and real estate developers.Dust and particulate matter: Construction activities, especially when not managed well, release large amounts of dust and particulate matter into the air, which directly impacts air quality. This is particularly damaging to health, as PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) levels increase, which are linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.Encroachment and disruption: Unnecessary construction projects often lead to the encroachment of green spaces and open areas. Trees and vegetation, which act as natural filters for pollutants, are cleared for buildings, roads, or commercial complexes. This reduces the city’s capacity to absorb air pollutants.Disruptions and inefficiencies: Construction activities can disrupt traffic, increase congestion, and lead to longer travel times. These inefficiencies in urban planning add to the pollution by increasing fuel consumption and emissions.4. Government Policies and EnforcementWhile the government has made efforts to address pollution through various measures like vehicle emission standards, odd-even schemes, promoting electric vehicles, and improving public transportation, enforcement remains a challenge.Lack of enforcement: Even though laws exist to regulate hawkers, vehicle emissions, construction activities, and waste management, enforcement is often weak. Political and bureaucratic challenges often result in poor implementation of these laws, leading to more pollution.Short-term solutions: Many policies address the symptoms rather than the root causes. For instance, initiatives like the odd-even rule or the shutting down of industries for a few days may reduce pollution temporarily but fail to address the long-term structural causes.Solutions and Way ForwardThere’s no single solution, but a combination of strategies could help alleviate the problem:Urban Planning: Better urban planning, with a focus on sustainable growth, efficient public transportation, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, could reduce congestion and pollution. Zoning regulations should be enforced more strictly to ensure that commercial activity doesn’t spill over into public spaces like footpaths.Hawker Regulation: Rather than cracking down on hawkers, the government could look at creating designated spaces for them where they don’t obstruct footpaths or roads. This would reduce congestion and ensure that street vendors are able to work without contributing to pollution.Construction Oversight: Stricter oversight and regulation of construction projects, ensuring that they follow environmental norms and manage dust pollution effectively, would help mitigate the environmental impact.Awareness Campaigns: Public awareness campaigns can encourage people to reduce their reliance on private vehicles, use public transport, and adopt more eco-friendly practices.Greening Delhi: The government could invest in increasing green spaces, promoting rooftop gardens, and planting more trees to help absorb pollutants and provide a buffer against heat and dust.Delhi’s pollution is undoubtedly a significant challenge, but a more coordinated and holistic approach could reduce its impact. As with many urban issues, tackling the problem requires the collaboration of citizens, businesses, and the government to create a healthier, more sustainable city."

5828,2024-11-03T06:07:25Z,Excellent video. I have watched and listened to it carefully. I am from Punjab in Pakistan and I live in Lahore which is now one of the most polluted cities in the world. We all know what the cause is but we are not ready to come out of our comfort zones. Be it traveling or harvesting. Thanks for sharing this video. The only thing is to keep spreading this message.Stay blessed.

5833,2024-10-23T10:50:02Z,This is one of the informative video on pollution
5834,2024-10-09T21:59:34Z,Same situation are coming in Maharashtra pune Mumbai  government people company not following rules not interested in that government should take strict action
5835,2024-10-02T18:15:39Z,you missed the fact that rice sowing was shifted from april to june post 2009 due to law passed in punjab and haryana for protecting ground water (lobbied by monsanto for pushing their GMO maize seeds) ..as a result harvest shifted from july/august to september /october and subsequently stubble burning ...for sowing wheat in winters...but during october wind direction changes and comes from north into delhi....as result the stuble burning pollution from punjab travels to delhi and stays here due to low wind speed and higher density in winters... hence the blame has to be put on monsanto for pushing govt. to change the rice sowing month ...
5836,2024-09-15T21:43:03Z,"I’m from Delhi. Though I live in south Delhi. Yamuna river water is polluted and contaminated by the factories, mills, workshops and big industries chemical mixed poisonous water. Which goes into the Yamuna river directly without any purification and filtration. Most of part of east Delhi’s sewage water falls into the Yamuna River. Wazirabad and Okhla industrial areas polluted water mixes up with Yamuna river water. Thats why this river looks like a stagnant pool and lifeless dead river. Aquatic animals lives are vulnerable in this river. Moreover anybody throw garbage and waste materials, even used flowers, plastic wrappers, bottles, poly bags, old torn clothes from their cars to the river from the Yamuna river bridge and emerge gods and goddesses clay idols as well to the river as a dumping ground. Congress, BJP and AAP all political parties are failure to start a clean Yamuna river mission and clean it properly neither maintain it continuously since 1993 to till now. AAP as a ruling political party with their CM candidate in Delhi have been ruling since 14th February, 2015 to till now. Almost 10 years. They are also failure to clean Yamuna river which flows through Delhi that part completely, neither control the air and water pollution, or either traffics, not even reduce corruption, and crimes. Delhi is not safe for anyone. Not only unsafe for women and kids rather its unsafe for men too. It has become a crime capital of India. Many areas are in Delhi which are underdeveloped and many inside roads and streets conditions are pathetic. You cant believe that is also Delhi. AAP Government and their present CM are epitome of failure. They did no welfare for Delhi and Delhiites. They did nothing in last 10 years except scams, scandals, corruptions, robbery, freebies, subsidiaries and drama. Shaded crocodile tears.Shiela Dixit was far better than other CMs. At least we Delhiites saw the infrastructures developments works and a lot of changes drastically happened overnight in Delhi. For last 10-15 years nothing much new developments happened in Delhi except redevelopment for the beautification of Delhi and G20 Summit in Delhi. Arvind Kejriwal got Delhi as a readymade city. He did nothing for Delhi except distribute freebees and subsidies etc. Being a Delhiite I wont cast my vote to AAP at any cost."

5841,2024-05-31T08:42:05Z,Hi abhi and niyu pls make a video on shatabdi and Rajdhani  train for throwing collected  garbage before entering station on track side. In future it&#39;s impossible  to collect these waste if railways will not take step in collection of garbage. U can see these garbage  dumped near track which looks very awkward. In every train the cleaning boy clean the coach and throw it outside anywhere it should be collect in station and proper dumping of these waste should to be done

5859,2024-01-15T00:52:06Z,As an NRI it has been since 2016 when I rode the metro in Delhi when visiting with relatives. I have seen some women relate being uncomfortable on public transport due to some men who behave badly. Is this a significant issue in general in people’s perspectives?

5866,2023-12-27T15:15:59Z,5:38 for the main causes of pollution
5867,2023-12-14T03:27:17Z,"The smog is neither due to stubble burning nor due to pollution. It is because of climatological factors and its changes in the recent past. The dust partilcles are levitated due to a thermo magnetic field above the surface of earth. The reasons can be of many,  but to quote a few 1. Hard scape surfaces have become proportionately much higher. 2. Water table has gone much lower. 3. Building demolition waste and plastic waste can also be a vital reason for the magnetic field. 4. Dense Population leads to more sewer waste. The biological decomposition of complex organic matter can also be great reason for the creation levitron field. In short we have to modify our by-laws for the construction industries. The simple solution and the remedy would be, converting ourselves to be an enviroment friendly individual. The very first step could be of , Learning about Environment."

5897,2023-11-20T00:33:53Z,"God knows what Delhi govt is doing in Delhi, always criticizing Modi and BJP Instead of implementing some solutions like Ensuring DTC buses running on time and maintain a 15-minute frequency on demanded routes, rather than implementing the even-odd rule. Mandate autos to use meters, introduce a single pass for all modes of transport, and launch an app to check the timings of buses, trains, and metros from source to destination to encourage public transport usage, which will decrease air pollution, traffic and fuel. Plant trees on barren land, Clean roads to remove dust pollution, Make good roads inside city, For waste pollution bring recycle policy and many more solutions are there but nothing implemented. Recently Indore asked all restaurants not to use coal in their tandoor and force to use gas tandoors to reduce air pollutions and trees."

It is basically everything you need to do to increase AQI, India is doing it. The problem hasn&#39;t been tackled by the government or the effort to find a solution is lack lustered. The problem has been shifted around because noone wants to deal with it, hence you now have record breaking AQI. The government has to set out policies and this is when the PM needs to take charge.....he talks big on the global stage, yet back at home yoiu have record breaking AQI."

5912,2023-11-17T13:26:46Z,"I want to shed light on an issue that seems detrimental to the future of Bharat, namely the growing habit of alcohol and cigarette consumption among youngsters. This year, as I joined college and started living in hostels, I observed that a significant number of seniors are engaged in these harmful habits. Even in the first year, many students are adopting these practices, considering it &#39;cool&#39; to have a bottle in hand and smoke cigarettes.I believe part of the problem is the lack of open discussion about these issues, and the normalization of such behaviors in society. Therefore, I am urging to  make a video on this isse for more awareness and conversation.Let&#39;s encourage a healthier lifestyle and work together to create a positive change for the future of our community.JAI BHARAT"

It does makes a huge impact because the cracker’s particles are much more harmful &amp; hazardous  ,So yes, It about educating people about knowing the limit, All of us live next to someone who made it difficult for us to even go on the roof or set outside,And its been happening since last 3 yrs!

5964,2023-11-14T15:17:43Z,"Does India still have strict laws for companies in air pollution even after 76 years of independence? The government wants to refrain from planting trees to reduce it. Bangalore is an example of how vehicle smoke alone can create a toxic pollution level. A lot of organic waste can be converted to manuvere which still needs to be an option. This organic waste can be used to generate cooking gas, but it still needs to be promoted heavily.I request you to start a program for housewives living in apartments to keep 4 pots in their home for tomato, chili, ladysfinger, etc?.  This can reduce organic waste as house waste can be reused as a maneuver, increase the air quality inside the home, and give kids non-toxic food. 50 homes in an apartment can do wonders for the same apartment, and housewives can make money."

5976,2023-11-14T07:30:19Z,Adding fraction of pollution to already existing pollution VS  compromising peoples sentiments and thier happiness. Don&#39;t ban firecrackers but ban bursting on roads. Let hindus enjoy to fullest in their society and please dont ban.

5988,2023-11-13T19:02:55Z,If u would have blamed centre government also it would have been a complete video .Plus with rain 2 days before Diwali AQI improved and with crackers burning on Diwali became hazardous so banning fire crackers was also is right.

5993,2023-11-13T18:02:15Z,"Can this not applied that instead of cutting down the trees, they just can uproot those trees, and subplant or transplant those somewhere else, and even try to make deserted lands or barren lands to be able to cultivate and trees can be grown atleastCan also if at every apartment or houses hotels hostels and buildings, terrace farming can be done, like china and Indonesia Waste management should be taken serious and advancement should be done"

6006,2023-11-13T15:37:37Z,"I appreciate the videos made by you and the efforts you put in to follow the problem and solution approach. The idea is really really good. But, the thing is people watch your video, get inspired for a day or two and they forget. But there are some people who want to put efforts on the discussed solution e.g. if the farmers can be explained and made aware of the fact that what is happening in Delhi might happen to their kid when they grow up, they may start taking action on it. I suggest If we can start building small local communities where people can take part and discuss the solution , take some steps on the solution and make others aware what they want to achieve then we would start to get results and the solution is not going to stop just in the video. It&#39;s gonna be implemented. There are lots of people here who want to make our country sustainable. Let&#39;s take a step towards the change and start working on it."

6019,2023-11-13T09:49:01Z,I don’t agree with a lot of points. Not a very well researched video.
6020,2023-11-13T09:44:47Z,"One thing that I noted through the image shared by NASA is that almost 95% of Farm Fires were in Punjab alone &amp; Haryana &amp; UP had very few pockets where we could see the red dots (depicting Farm fire).So why can&#39;t AAP Government in Punjab also follow the Haryana model of renting out stubble collection to Private Agencies &amp; renting out machines involved in cutting stubble at subsidized rates to farmers.If Punjab Government across all parties have given subsidies on Water, Electricity &amp; what not, I am sure subsidies can be given on this noble initiative too that will help atleast Delhi Government (in projecting it has successfully tackled pollution) if not others + profitable for Farmers &amp; would give rise to farm based businesses like Ethanol Industries, Cardboard based industries, creating employment.Another thing that Government across all levels, specially at the Municipal Level can focus on would be investing in Road Cleaners &amp; Water Spinklers.This will also help reduce pollution as well to a big extent &amp; another benefit might be that it would make our cities clean, improving their overall tourism potential.Third could obviously be stricter pollution control norms for Industries, specially those Industries that are looking to get established in NCR (not solely Delhi as pollution affects entire NCR). This again would come under respective State Governments.If these 3 things are taken care of by respective governments, atleast 60-70% of pollution problem would be tackled providing a major relief to citizens living in NCR."

6030,2023-11-13T07:01:19Z,Hiii.. dere is one best solution to dis pollution problem which i think you guys should add to your solution problem and make it so viral that it reaches to government ears... That is we can lower the finance ratio on private cars and motorcycles. In today&#39;s time it&#39;s very easy to buy a private vehicle as 90 to 95% of the cost gets financed so it&#39;s in everyone&#39;s reach and that&#39;s why people have different reasons for owning a vehicle. If the government lowers down the finance ratio say 50%-60% then will not prefer buying a vehicle rather will be indirectly forced to use the public transport. As we humans are very rigid at times we ignore what we see and we realise it when we are forced to do something. I have an example of Singapore owning a pvt vehicle is so expensive out there that people themselves prefer using the public transport and by doing dis they are also helping the economy to grow...

6034,2023-11-13T06:21:47Z,All fire crackers must be banned completely.

6041,2023-11-13T05:00:39Z,"Please reconsider your stance on the subject of use of fire crackers on individual basis. However, everyone enjoys display of fireworks therefore safety is when such displays conducted collectively by pyro-technicians in a controlled environment for the enjoyment of the whole community. Similarly burning oil lamps (and candles) not only wastes precious oil but also produces fire hazards. Moreover, environmental pollution produced by the toxic fumes and the waste produced by the use of fire crackers, sparklers, rockets, etc. is detrimental for most people and the environment as a whole."
6042,2023-11-13T03:58:27Z,This problem is caused by humans. So we should not blamed anyone but humans&#39; carelessness.

Google says the best period to go to India is between October and March, well thats wrong info cause if I would have know this I would not have come between these months to India. I can&#39;t even find live webcams of the Taj Mahal or Agra online to have a look at the situation"

6076,2023-11-12T10:12:14Z,Thanks for the solution at the last of the video
6077,2023-11-12T10:11:15Z,People feel proud and also as a symbol of status to use cars everyday even for a small thing but they don&#39;t realize it is creating too much of air and noise pollution and leading to traffic jams. I&#39;m from Bangalore and I absolutely hate how the traffic has increased enormously after covid coz people started using cars more.
6078,2023-11-12T10:00:58Z,Bade Bhai if plastic can ban why not crackers production to be banned rigorously
6079,2023-11-12T09:42:43Z,New year pe patakhe phode to celebration  aur Diwali pe phode to pollution !!
6080,2023-11-12T08:43:23Z,Great video guys your doing an amazing job bringing soo much vital information to your viewers.

6081,2023-11-12T08:41:23Z,It&#39;s like studying global warming sitting in ac room
6082,2023-11-12T08:41:10Z,They should have controlled places where they can burn crackers. Large maidans with alotta air movement. On the outskirts of cities. So people can enjoy the festival with their kids and not pollute the city air even more.
6083,2023-11-12T07:41:10Z,Beautifully explained
6084,2023-11-12T07:22:18Z,even sports cars n private jets also main emissoin source....2 tons of co2 in 1hrs of travel...this also should need to ban

6091,2023-11-12T06:01:31Z,Indian politicians should take tuitions from this channel!!!
6092,2023-11-12T05:41:16Z,"I don&#39;t support fire crackers not because they cause pollution, but because they were never originally there in Hindu culture for celebrating Diwali. Fire crackers were invented in China. And many children are employed under hazardous conditions for manufacturing fire crackers.Also, can&#39;t wait for Bin Baat Chep and NY crimes media reporters to post anti India news articles about how India causes so much pollution in the world while totally forgetting how fire crackers are used throughout the world on New year&#39;s Eve starting from Japan and Australia and continuing on for a full day before ending with USA and Canada. How much pollution the world suffers during this?"
6093,2023-11-12T05:38:15Z,punjab me air quality index 119 he or delhi me 290 how stubble burning affect only delhi it means there are many other factors

6098,2023-11-12T04:41:55Z,rice straws are not degradable in nature so most farmers burn it and as I am a microbiology student the fungus 0. joyonii is soo helpful to degrade the stubble but it takes some time India can do some research about it to make the fungus more impact able

6107,2023-11-12T03:43:51Z,"I think Delhi should stop buying private taxis for about 2 years. Instead, the emphasis should be on selling electric cars."
6108,2023-11-12T03:24:40Z,main reason of air pollution is vehicles
6109,2023-11-12T03:20:51Z,Super proud of you Abhi and Niyu !!!Blessings to the country !

6113,2023-11-12T00:17:47Z,"Banning firecrackers is surely a good step and hope it&#39;s implemented strictly.It is infact a main cause for polluting.Radioactive and poisonous elements are used to spread the colour in the sky when crackers burst, which can increase the risk of cancer.And for financial goal life of people should not be risked."

6118,2023-11-11T19:21:10Z,"Lmao telling people to use public transport over private is dumb. Owning a vehicle is in fact a luxury and at the same time it also serves as a utility. There are various factors like safety that also influence these decisions. So while it is for the greater good, i’ll still spend my money the way i want. Thanks but no thanks."

6125,2023-11-11T17:46:25Z,"@abhiandniyuCan you guide me in this? For plantation, do we need permission from municipal corporation?? Which re the places where we can plant trees?? And anything else we need to keep in mind before starting these small projects??"
6126,2023-11-11T17:35:55Z,Population = Pollution
6127,2023-11-11T17:33:09Z,Delhi metro is not good as well. It is too crowded!. I never get a seat.
6128,2023-11-11T17:29:18Z,9:24 rainwater harvesting aur  soils ko concrete se na Dhak ke thodi jagah soil ko water absorb karne karne de to ground water recharge hoga
6129,2023-11-11T16:57:50Z,My solution for the pollution control if anyone agree like it: public transport se safar karna normal hai but if you wanna stop pollution just buy a cycle and go anywhere you want cycle se koi pollution hota nahin aur paise bhi bachenge
6130,2023-11-11T16:55:34Z,Your knowledge is true and your solution is very sincerely

6138,2023-11-11T15:37:18Z,"Wow, that&#39;s great advice. You&#39;re making excuses for setting off fireworks. There are more incidents during the times of Dussehra and Diwali.&quot;Diwali hasn&#39;t even started yet, yet you&#39;re making judgments. What about Dushehra? You didn&#39;t mention it. Did you intentionally overlook it?Don&#39;t turn this into a religious issue.Make your statement after Diwali is over in Delhi. It&#39;s guaranteed that Haryana and Delhi are in great danger.How can you advise people when you&#39;re in Mumbai, which has far less pollution than Delhi?People are commenting based on religious bias. They live in a different place and lecture about pollution and how to solve it. The government will never change; it constantly blames other parties or people, even when they plant trees. Is this action worthwhile on a large scale? No, it&#39;s merely an initiative to show that we support the environment. It&#39;s all for show.After the results are in, the youth are either migrating or becoming ill. At this time, people are experiencing respiratory problems. Many are dying, and no one is addressing it. At least build windmills to circulate the air. That&#39;s the only solution we have right now."
6139,2023-11-11T15:10:17Z,I just want to ask you a question that if we will not purchase car and any other vehicles and use the public transport than who purchase the car and obviously the vehicle market is too large and we also say that it depends on our economy so we just say that everything is interlinked we can&#39;t stop to purchase a vehicle not for showoff but also for the market....
6140,2023-11-11T14:43:19Z,Ham to luxury car me ghoomenge warna kis baat ke successful kahalaayenge society will eat you
6141,2023-11-11T14:37:34Z,Odd even car driving was good or bad?
6142,2023-11-11T14:26:54Z,"If crackers are a problem, then why is there no restriction on New Year, match celebrations, other religions feasts, etc."
6143,2023-11-11T14:04:49Z,So we are not allowed to use fireworks when India wins the world cup
6144,2023-11-11T13:39:10Z,Russia isreal me Jo war chal rahi uska reason bhi Diwali hai aur Diye (chipak) jalne se global warming hoti hai poles ki ice pighal jati hai
6145,2023-11-11T13:29:38Z,"What about dushera raavn burning , it gives oxygen right"
6146,2023-11-11T13:21:44Z,"Solution 1: Cars, Actually I even don&#39;t own a car but believe me it&#39;s comfort not looking cool for me. So we need to think of some new solution than public transport. Private vehicle give a flexibility of travelling, halts, timing, etc."
6147,2023-11-11T13:13:47Z,This IITian CM should find a innovative  solution such that Delhi people do not even require to breathe for living
6148,2023-11-11T13:11:42Z,Delhi’s air can only be cleaned if and only if AAP forms government in Haryana. The earlier misconception that stubble burning in Punjab was polluting Delhi’s air has been dymystified by AAP government in Punjab
6149,2023-11-11T13:01:58Z,I strongly recommend that Punjab must stop production of rice and the government should support the alternative solution.
6150,2023-11-11T12:50:31Z,This should be telecast on television so that every middle class family get  aware about how hazardous this Air pollution is.
6151,2023-11-11T12:46:10Z,"Planting trees especially mango, Banyan and neem around Delhi and in the heart of Delhi could reduce air pollution, also managing waste collection could help."
6152,2023-11-11T12:41:40Z,"The only reason is Stubble burning. Transportation, Construction, cooking happens all the time Delhi throughout the Year. This year Diwali has not come yet. Yet the Aqi is 999+. Because of something unique right that only happen in the month of October-November. It’s stubble burning. Also the wind speed is slow throughout winter. Yet December and January is much more cleaner than October-November"
6153,2023-11-11T12:24:38Z,Abhi and Nihu please make a video where we could learn how to clean out lungs by homely remedy.

6162,2023-11-11T10:43:23Z,Everyone in india is responsible for this
6163,2023-11-11T10:37:59Z,"Unlike what people think, banning firecrackers is one of a solution, this video, it seemed to be much focused upon blaming irresponsible and uneducated farmers for stubble farming whereas the educated youth of India questions if the decision to burn firecrackers were legit or not. A bit hypocritical"
6164,2023-11-11T10:15:25Z,Waste burning is also a major reason for pollution but you did not talk about itttt ....Because i have always seen the waste being burned in our locality by the sweepers who come to clean them.... I am from Tamilnadu ...hope i could do something about this as a student I am unable to find a solution for this problem

6167,2023-11-11T09:42:38Z,"And you should also tell people to plant TREES it purifies the AIR, and everyone should keep a day in a week to plant TREES as much as you can, In India 140 crore people live in India if one person plants 1 tree in 1 day of a week then imagine 140 crore trees will be a planted which is very much good for the environment and for the animals and for the future.Hope in next video you will mention this point"

6184,2023-11-11T07:41:55Z,I mean ... I knew u guys have a RW bias. But How can you be so ignorant in your research. The SC verdict is only for firecrackers containing (Barium and other prohibited chemicals). That&#39;s  it. This verdict was already in place. SC just clarified that the verdict extends to whole of country and not just a particular state. To equate this with a blanket ban is either foolish or malicious. U decide what was ur intentions.

We cannot do this in  large scale but we can plant imp plants like Neem, peepal, bougainvillea, rubber plant, etc which can help trap dust. I have seen water sprinkler vehicles in my city( Guwahati), I think it is used to settle down  the dust particles."

6196,2023-11-11T06:39:45Z,"I didnt thought about it.. Yes. There are so many reasons for air pollution and Delhi remains polluted the whole year but evry next day of Diwali we read highlighted news about higly polluted Delhi due to crackers. Construction, vehicular emissions I believe is the major reason . Crackers are just too occasional. Most of the people already have lessened bursting crackers still the blame is on crackers. Bursting crackers  was banned earlier in Assam but after few days they allowed only between specified  timing.Your this video should be watched by the actual decision implementors."
6197,2023-11-11T06:39:39Z,Good contact and lession

6199,2023-11-11T06:27:19Z,Kotha should stop interfering in civil society. Kotha should limited to judiciary only. Kotha easy target is hindu community and interfering in religious practice because this community can do andolan against caste and selfish motive but cannot fight against such judegment

6203,2023-11-11T06:06:14Z,I&#39;m watching the video in Diwali and firecrackers are burning in my background
6204,2023-11-11T05:56:18Z,Very informative
6205,2023-11-11T05:54:41Z,Government only focus on election not pollution. It is the biggest problem from the last Decade...
6206,2023-11-11T05:54:21Z,Your good person  Jai hind sir

6208,2023-11-11T05:47:24Z,Most knowledgeable person
6209,2023-11-11T05:44:13Z,"Abhi &amp; Niyu, I appreciate your concern regarding the biggest problem that is pollution, everyone tried every thing which includes putting a ban on what is going on instead I feel like the government should put a rule for every adult citizen of the country to plant a tree as they are oxygen generator, natural air purifier, they&#39;ll help in rain due to which ground water level will rise. Planting a tree in natural form which should be planted in soil not in pots on the rooftop or balcony. Putting a temporary ban on anything will not resolve anything. Lockdown happened 3 years back and it cleaned the air. So this can be the second method of going in lockdown mode of continuous 2 months in one year. The environment can heal itself. We just need to support him. Planting trees is the solution to everything. If there are 100 trees in society use of AC is very less in comparison to society where there are no trees."
6210,2023-11-11T05:43:21Z,Delhi is dying or karo industrialization. Nice
6211,2023-11-11T05:28:56Z,"Why can&#39;t the Supreme Court BAN burning of &quot;paraali&quot; in North India ?? Which is the main cause of pollution in Delhi NCR. If crackers are the reason, how come that the pollution levels are hazardous BEFORE Diwali !!!"
6212,2023-11-11T05:25:57Z,Cheer up  for you guys.
6213,2023-11-11T05:25:51Z,"Awesome video. Only one question, the pollution that comes from vehicles in Delhi comes throughout the year then why transport system targeted this time of year only why not the entire year or permanently"
6214,2023-11-11T05:20:12Z,Bhai Video content is good but if ur inspring people …. At least comb ur hair or get  it trimed … this shabby looks will spoil our youth.

6221,2023-11-11T04:26:46Z,The main problem is politicalisation....... Punjab farmer can do but no dedication of punjab political party....
6222,2023-11-11T04:14:47Z,Yes brother and sister
6223,2023-11-11T03:59:02Z,Ppl who are thinking about triggered insaan

6225,2023-11-11T03:44:40Z,Green crackers are allowed bro!!
6226,2023-11-11T03:29:02Z,Wonderful approach of explaining Environment issues.
6227,2023-11-11T03:26:14Z,"Actually firecrackers should ban not only for Diwali, it should be banned for everything"
6228,2023-11-11T03:25:35Z,"Hindu festivals time air politician ... What the nonsense ... 365 days we all indians and world wide humans using bikes , cars , ac so many things using these are pollution is happening .  Why u people don&#39;t tellings this things ... Only Diwali is coming pollution what a joke bro"
6229,2023-11-11T03:23:42Z,So holi and deepawali are not the causes of water scarcity and pollution actually meat used to much water so stop eating meat non veg fools then see water scarcity those people who cant control their mouth are telling that water scarcity is done due to holi
6230,2023-11-11T03:19:54Z,"First of all even if one will use whole and every vehicle one day or two day this will not damage the whole environment in a day so the fire crackers are not the main reason so dont try to say that one day or two day deepawali can destroy your environment. What about green house effects, cfcs from fridge and Ac&#39;s, and vehicle as you see corona have done it that the main cause are factories and vehicles"
6231,2023-11-11T03:12:47Z,Banning firecrackers what try some better for environment Don&#39;t play politicsThis is my humble request for politician
6232,2023-11-11T02:55:16Z,I think blame game oneday Delhi godown and inhabited delhi
6233,2023-11-11T02:34:16Z,Stubble burning should be stopped for sure- somehow.But there is more to Delhi NCR air during this period besides stubble burning. It&#39;s dangerous cocktail of lot of factors which amplify the problem.Why is that areas which are burning stubble have peak AQI of 300 while in Delhi it has crossed 500 for many days.
6234,2023-11-11T02:24:41Z,"Neither SC nor Centre nor Khujlieal could ban blockade of a busy road in capital of India by a few hundrex women in Delhi. Same SC and politicuans are incapable of banning few thousand farmers in their neighborhood from burning Parali. But these fellows dare to control hundred crore Hindus from celebrating their festivals. How n why? Because we are law abiding.  . If BJP really cared, they would have hired a capable advicate to fight the case. For namesake, a felliw goes and files a case and as usual,"
6235,2023-11-11T02:15:19Z,Chemtrail responsible for pollution. Nobody will tell you and it is hidden truth

6247,2023-11-10T19:10:20Z,"In cases of transport you are partly correct, in Delhi 79% population is working and yes they do take out cars but only 10% of the people who cannot travel through public various reasons, now rest of 90% people park there vehicles on metro parking and then travel in metro because of parking issue.    Now don’t forget bikes. There are 50 millions bikes all over delhi 70% were used in transport industry, but in all these vehicles don’t forget to count E vehicles which is 25% of all vehicle population,So did you see the way everyone is targeting pollution on vehicles and fire crackers but no body want highlight the hidden factories of marbles, concrete, toxic waste burnings used in mayapuri, okhla and other industrial areas. Delhi government is just playing politics on pollution without recognising there own stupid doings shitty government.."
6248,2023-11-10T19:04:29Z,Court of India is becoming a joke .... Their only target is Hindus and Hindu festivals
6249,2023-11-10T19:03:37Z,Hariyana and UP is working good but KEJRIWAL Sarkar&#39;s Punjab not .... He blame first first for the Punjab govt bcz election then now blaming other states... But the satelite image showing the reality.
6250,2023-11-10T18:53:58Z,"Agree on the public transport part that it is normal as well as cool but come with me to Pune, let&#39;s try to board in a bus to my workplace - Hinjewadi. I assure you you&#39;ll struggle to even breathe inside of this bus. 1 bus should not accommodate more than it&#39;s capacity! but that&#39;s not the case..buses in pune accommodate crowd of 10 buses in just a single bus! population itni hai, isliye i think people prefer personal vehicles over public transports. koi bhi problem ho, pehla solution to uska population control se he hoga, no other way! you may disagree but that&#39;s the ugly truth."
6251,2023-11-10T18:47:31Z,Burning crackers should not be part of celebrating auspicious festival.

Ask people to donate funds ...Bhai look at the population...annaj to chaiye....2nd) Focus on research and if you can get any idea from different countries then focus on it."

6261,2023-11-10T17:29:29Z,You should make a video on individual oriented solution and precautions we as a person can take to improve our health in this polluted environment.Thanks

6269,2023-11-10T16:39:35Z,Some farmers of northern Indian states are killing themselves by stubble burning
6270,2023-11-10T16:38:07Z,See no one is blaming diwali but jaha situation already worst hai waha crackers fhodke worst se worst ho jayega so worst ko aur worst na karne ke liye ban zaruri hai and jo chupke chupke fhodte hai woh government ka failure hai.
6271,2023-11-10T16:25:24Z,"everyone enjoy Diwali,  dont listen to supreme court. nothing will change for bursting crackers for 2-3 hours."
6272,2023-11-10T16:16:47Z,Instead of banning crackers they should ban A.Cs for commercial use .

6298,2023-11-10T13:20:01Z,Public transport should be free in delhi like luxumberg to promote public transport

6309,2023-11-10T11:51:00Z,"I am currently doing government internship under CRM (Crop residue management) scheme-2023 in Haryana and government is doing a lot of work in this matter. Providing machines on subsidy, regular interactions with farmers, beneficiaries and custom hiring centres. Spreading awareness, organizing camps in each and every village of haryana. Hiring interns and staff for additional help in the harvest season. And all this hardwork is paying off. Ofcourse we still have a very long way to go. Some problems are - not enough facilities/industries to process stubble (exsitu management), financial problem of farmers, local political agendas, less punishment to farmers who burn stubble, life risk factor on agricuture officers who try to stop burning onsite,unsuccessful pusa decomposers, happy seeder, etc."
6310,2023-11-10T11:37:51Z,I&#39;ll not burst a single cracker on this Diwali...but I&#39;ll plant 10 trees and will celebrate Diwali by putting 10 diyas under those plants...i hope it will help my country..and my people  Happy Diwali everyone

6315,2023-11-10T11:17:40Z,Diwali its the festival of lights not pataka or noise pollution
6316,2023-11-10T11:07:27Z,"The city and that whole country is dirty and chaotic. That&#39;s why they are all desperate to emigrate from India."

6319,2023-11-10T10:35:33Z,40%  banned  firecrackers and increase and restrict the law PUC car checkup compulsory
6320,2023-11-10T10:23:52Z,4 pax car norm should be compulsory
6321,2023-11-10T10:17:27Z,"What I have learnt from this video ! To address pollution in Delhi, various measures can be implemented:1. Promote Sustainable Transportation:Promote walking, bicycling, and public transportation as ways to cut down on vehicle emissions. Invest in environmentally responsible and effective public transit options.2. Strict Emission Standards:Enforce and regularly update stringent emission standards for industries and vehicles to limit air pollutants.3. Green Spaces:Increase the number of green spaces and urban forests to absorb pollutants and improve overall air quality.4. Waste Management:Implement effective waste management systems to reduce open burning of waste, a significant contributor to air pollution.5.Renewable Energy Promotion:Encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources for power generation to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.6.Awareness Campaigns:Conduct public awareness campaigns to educate people about the impact of pollution and promote responsible behavior.7. Crop Residue Management:Address agricultural practices contributing to air pollution, especially stubble burning. Promote alternative methods for crop residue disposal.8. Stricter Construction Regulations:Implement and enforce construction guidelines to minimize dust emissions at construction sites.9. Air Quality Monitoring:Invest in a robust air quality monitoring system to track pollution levels and take timely actions based on real-time data.10. Community Engagement:Involve the community in pollution control efforts, encouraging responsible practices and reporting violations.For individuals, adopting eco-friendly practices like carpooling, reducing energy consumption, and proper waste disposal can contribute to pollution control.

Punjab Govt had proposed to Govt of India that they also chip in money (along with Delhi Govt which had agreed to chip in) for Cash Incentives to Farmers to stop stubble burning but due to Dirty Politics, Govt of India rejected that proposal!   Inspite of that, Punjab has achieved a 50%+ reduction in farm fires since last year and 70% reduction since AAP Govt took over.   Do you see any other CM (be it Haryana or UP) being questioned apart from Kejriwal?  NO Because Godi Media is running a political agenda to malign AAPModi Govt hijacked full power of Delhi Govt by passing an undemocratic Services Bill to overturn the decision of Supreme Court Constitution Bench which had ruled in favor of Kejriwal Govt &amp; democracy that &#39;Elected Govt should have power over IAS officers&#39;!  Do you know that officers in Delhi are disobeying Delhi Cabinet Ministers and doing anti-people activities like stopping IIT Kanpur study, stopping SMOG tower, etc?   Ministers are publicly saying that yet no action is being taken by BJP&#39;s LG (final authority) against these errant officers who&#39;re playing with public lives. This only means that they have full political patronage from BJP (which wants to malign Kejriwal) otherwise IAS officers are professionals - why will they do anti-people activities openly like these?And just see the Tweets daily by BJP leaders like Harshvardhan, Shehzad Poonawalla, Amit Malviya, Gautam Gambhir, Manoj Tiwari, etc - it will be proven how&#39;re they&#39;re singly targeting and defaming Arvind Kejriwal who doesn&#39;t even have the powers in Delhi!  While inspite of having full powers in Delhi, LG is running away from accountability. And inspite of it being a multi-state issue which comes under the domain of PM, the PM is not doing anything constructive except election rallies!"

6337,2023-11-10T07:32:06Z,"You think as if Supreme Court is a pollution control agency. They only give decisions when a PIL is filed. So they don&#39;t have control on the timing.Although firecracker ban is irrational, even if it controls 0.1% of the pollution, it&#39;s still logical. Its a completely discretionary item.Stopping factories, construction, vehicles comes with a lot of inconveniences. Stubble burning obvs is the prominent cause."

Diwali me firecrackers se pollution hota hai, and if you are not ready to accept it than I think you need to do more research. You talk about bursting firecrackers in political rallies and during certain celebration, are you seriously trying to &#39;educate&#39; people and can&#39;t even compare that with firecracker bursting for 3-4 hours throughout the nation during diwali?  This video is one of the main reasons that people in India need to apply their own brain before getting influenced from such content."
6348,2023-11-10T06:01:21Z,SC has not banned firecrackers but the certain chemicals used to make those crackers thereby a misunderstanding that SC banned firecrackers

If you are living in Delhi, you are only contributing to the pollution. It’s a personal choice. There’s no point making such videos. We all have options available."
6352,2023-11-10T05:31:53Z,"Sorry to say but i disagree with your cracker point. In the whole video you concentrated only on delhi’s air pollution. But about places like mumbai which are covered by sea from 3 sides and there is no stubble burning in the neighbouring states. And even if they were, the air wouldn’t be coming towards mumbai as the winds blows in the opposite direction. Also you forgot the fact that the companies making fire crackers start polluting the air even before the diwali arives. The pollution created because of making of these crackers is also equivalent to 1/3 of the total pollution made by vehicles in the whole year. Also those 5 days of diwali, make pollution equivalent to 2/4 of the total pollution from different sources in the year. AFAIK diwali was supposed to be festival of lights rather then festival of fireworks. During my childhood, i grew up watching people wearing colourful clothes, doing colourful rangolis, lighting up diyas, putting colour full lights and lanterns. I never saw people bursting crackers on such large scales. It is just that people have taken to their ego now a days, they just want to show off how much they are capable of spending on firecrackers. These same people would cry for money the 360 days of the year and then spend their savings in those 5 days to show off. I see people wasting 10k per day on firecrackers. The same people keep whining about having no money the whole year."

I live in the US. If I want, I can drive to work every day, which takes much less time, but I take the public bus, so one car releases less emissions to the environment or uses fewer gallons of gasoline, a biofuel.

6490,2023-11-09T10:05:12Z,"I agree on most of what you said but simply saying that people don&#39;t use public transport because it is uncool is a false statement. Other serious reasons for people not using public transport are - 1. Safety in public transport2. Public transport in Delhi might be very good but it is still not the most convenient method to travel in every case since it might take a person 15-20 min walk or an auto to reach the metro station followed by changing trains to reach the destination. People would always prefer more convenient methods over showoff. As of now personal vehicles are still more convenient to reach from point A to point B instead of taking multiple trains/buses followed by autos/walking. This is similar to taking a direct flight (also called the point to point model) instead of flying to a hub and then taking another flight to reach your final destination. I agree that driving is Delhi is also not the most convenient thing.I am curious to know if late at night when there are comparatively less number of vehicles on road, do we see an impact on the AQI. Where I live during peak traffic hours the AQI was ~460 the other day, whereas at 1:40am the AQI was still above 430 which to me indicates that vehicles might not have as big of an impact as people might claim"

While you can&#39;t stop a person from buying a car, you can definitely regulate, how many does he/ she can buy.

Till Diwali there will be no news on air pollution but as soon as diwali is near they start air pollution.  Give holidays to school ,colleges weekly 2 days and offices  2days. Instead conduct online classes. Monthly if it is done and reduce vehicles which emits pollution the environment will be safe. Reduce diesel oriented vehicles."

No government is paying attention to the problem faced by villagers and farmer. When it came to Delhi then they stared taking the action.Police and security forces are there but just to protect politicians not for public. The Whole world laughing at us.

As I am associated with Travel and Tourism industry, I have to travel different countries for tourism purposes. Visited Singapore couple of months back. I came across a video in any other YT channel regarding How Singapore Keeps their air clean.I rechecked with my co-workers in Singapore that is that really true. They replied every night their garbages and other stuffs are being gathered and collected by the Environment Cleaners and they dump everything into a burning pit. Slowly the garbages are burnt and the smoke gets purified by the air purifiers. The clean O2 is released in the air to breathe in and the left over residuals are recycled and gets used for various production works. Such a simple process and effective.This can be a solution for us too if the blame game players actually gets serious about the issues."

6585,2023-11-08T22:31:19Z,cracking fireworks on the City ROAD is totally Nonsense activity.. Culture is different and nonsense is different. In RURAL areas its fine. Less population less Vehicles. Big bombs disturbs drivers and become difficult to drive. Small small childs come to road and do this. THERE SHOULD BE A SAFE and SEPARATE PLACE TO DO THIS. There is no advantage of fireworks except TEMPORARY JOY and If not big but damage to Air Quality.

And it&#39;s not a sudden last moment decision. It&#39;s been the same decision since many years. The court just repeats the same order every year to remind us.

Nobody from Hindu community is going to riots or rockets launches even if they Ban lightening Diyas on Diwali.Plus, Hindus are not the deciding factor in the electoral win. Muslims are. Hence the &quot;Diwali Blame Game&quot; ..."

6729,2023-11-08T10:57:57Z,"you guys are really doing great. btw Delhi metro needs to increase their capacity, as there are people who actually want to travel through public transport but can&#39;t due to the rush at metro stations. There are a lot of solutions which can be taken up but India and its shitty politics, it&#39;s so shitty that it might crush anything which might be good for the public but might be a political loss to a few."
6730,2023-11-08T10:55:44Z,The only point you talked about is stuble burning. You only tried to make farmers devil(farmers who feed your parents)

6732,2023-11-08T10:45:57Z,Hey guys loved the video... would love to see you guys make a video on India&#39;s Pvt Health Sector. Something interesting just might pop up
6733,2023-11-08T10:36:04Z,Thank you for all your efforts to educate some of us with a solution-oriented approach. I live in Pune and air pollution is at its peak which was never the case however the government finds a reactive approach like telling people to use masks rather than a proactive approach where they should find a solution to minimize the air pollution. I have never stopped wearing a mask since covid as air pollution is a slow poison.
6734,2023-11-08T10:34:16Z,"After watching this video,I want to share my views.Few years back the types of houses were either indpendent or standalone apartments.In recent times, in most of the metro cities we are seeing the concept of gated communities.And the best part about these are within the community everything is maintained neat and clean irrespective of the way it is outside the community.This seems to be possible because there is a committee that looks after the maintainence of the community and every household pays a fee on monthly basis to the committee.I could see an analogy of the country with a community where the committee maps to the government and the fee maps to the tax paid.Any complaint to the committee is taken and resolved as early possible.But it&#39;s not the same with government.When stuble burning is causing hazard then why cant the government come up with a team that would use the necessary equipment to remove the stuble and the land is ready for the next crop.To promote the growth of other crops, the government could provide MSP to other crops as well with proper research."
6735,2023-11-08T10:32:36Z,Dude we already bhought fire crakers now what to do about it .
6736,2023-11-08T10:25:20Z,Why these type of videos are not available in English...So that south side could also gain knowledge
6737,2023-11-08T10:21:08Z,Bro any ways I like fireworks when they only used in festivals not some weird experiment but use them correctly OK
6738,2023-11-08T10:18:02Z,Instead of banning fire crackers they may ban fire crackers industry so that noone can blame firecrackers again

6751,2023-11-08T09:52:59Z,Supreme Court has clarified that it&#39;s order banning the use of barium and banned chemicals in fire crackers but they didn&#39;t mention about banning of fire crackers.

A suggestion from my side is that burning firecrackers is considered in our tradition as a joy of happiness for one day so government should not stop people for doing that but government should promote our country’s citizens to plant a tree by each of us on diwali and other special festivals which would help us and our future generation too"

6805,2023-11-08T08:26:09Z,Thank you soo much for making real problem and solutions videos.
6806,2023-11-08T08:25:18Z,The Whole Video Was Nice ILove Your Content A Lott.But Here You Defended Crackers that Was Wrong .I Know Supreme Court Took On Time Action .I Know Pollution Is On Peak Before Diwali .But If We Burnt Crackers On Diwali It Would Get More Worsen .Crackers Are Not Only Factor I know .But Its The Factor Which Pollutes air Very Fastly In One Night .(You Can See AQI Of Previous Year Of Before &amp; After Diwali) I Thought You Would Also Give Message To the People Who Just Burnt Crackers Due to Ego. I.E If They Kill A Bakri We Would Burnt Crackers.
6807,2023-11-08T08:24:14Z,"Not only lacks information but this video is full of misinformation as well. Should have said more about the quality of the vehicles in streets , the lack of govt planning in urban development,mindless permission to construction projects , no differentiation between high and low density residential areas , Govt unwillingness in putting money in recycling sector, of course personal responsibility when it comes to personal hygiene, and yeah, if you think firecrackers don&#39;t pollute the air , I think you are wrong and purposefully promoting the use of firecrackers. Do one thing, next time, show us the AQI on the Diwali night across the country,we will figure it out . I dare you to make a video on it and I know that you are not gonna even dare  just one word of advice , i know you have a lot of sheeps as your followers,but we are already choking with toxic air even in small towns, just skip any topic on environmental issues next time because you lack the tools to conduct proper research and may be getting paid those firecracker sellers , instead stick to planting mango trees and patting yourself on your back ."

Thank you Abhi and Niyu, I respect you guys a lot, and I’m really influenced by the way you people think! Keep up the good work!

6832,2023-11-08T07:43:08Z,Sir I think Sulphur and potassium chloride which is used by children these days  instead of fire crackers by children these days is more dangerous air pollutants than firecrackers because it  increase particle of sulphur in air and if it comes in contact of fire burn vigorously.
6833,2023-11-08T07:42:04Z,Let&#39;s make Diwali this way....

6840,2023-11-08T07:29:58Z,"@AbhiandNiyu It’s not a complete solution but it’s better not to worsen the condition even more, as a biotechnologist I think, with already existing pollution, the firecrackers can also worsen the conditions. Firecrackers can be only brought back after solving the root cause or atleast put limitations on the firecrackers. Also about cricket matches, political rallies and weddings burst firecrackers only for few minutes not for hours and hours over the night."
6841,2023-11-08T07:28:27Z,The only solution i can think of now is farmers from Punjab and Haryana should stop cultivating rice and wheat and instead cultivate vegetables or fruits.

6854,2023-11-08T07:09:01Z,Govt. Ban 10 year old diesel 15 year old petrol cars but do you know how much pollution generated and energy waste  during manufacturing of new vehicles.  Vehicle pollution certificate is mostly fake. Govt. Check puc of vehicles but mostly manufacturing industries using 20-30 year old generators / lifters. Waste water not treated properly and there are 100 of causes.

6881,2023-11-08T06:27:50Z,See banning firecrackers is actually important and it was getting implemented one day or the other and the thing is that it does create an impact on pollution as well Diwali is associated with a festival of lights not festival of firecrackers there should be a change in mindset which gov can&#39;t control try to avoid using crackers so that we can try one small step against pollution

6890,2023-11-08T06:19:59Z,"Banning crackers is not the only solution. Now, the people are so engrossed in the celebration that it is not possible to immediately stop it. Every Action should be taken in a proper time and in a proper manner. Not only the government, people efforts are also needed for the change.Blaming is not the solution and today the world has become like this only,we don&#39;t take the responsibility,rather we are only busy blaming each other. Small small efforts can lead to big Changes and now it has become the utmost important. We cannot change the geographical location rather we have to change the things that is in our hands, because we are living here and it&#39;s our responsibility."

6898,2023-11-08T06:06:57Z,"Wrong fact: Log uncool lagne ki vjah se metro nhi lete.Reality:Ap rajiv chowk station par metro lijiye, apko real reason samajh ayga. There are stations jahaan agar ap metro me chadte ho to khade rehne ki jagah bhi nahi hoti, or ap utar kar dusri metro ka wait krte ho itne me utne hi log next metro me bhi chad jaate hain. Or usme bhi jagah nahi hoti. Fir ek average income krne vala person bhi emi pe apni car prefer krta h, usey stress h traffic me rehna pdega but still thought ye hota h pure din kaam krke vapas aate tym baith to pyega. Solution: metro is already a successful model, just expand it, delhi should buy/make more metro and they should put more blocks and more seats for passenger&#39;s comfort. By this way any delhi person will not even think about using their own car because they are getting a way better deal (comfort+no traffic)."

6930,2023-11-08T05:16:18Z,Delhi metro is unable to handle the passengers during peak hours. That&#39;s why people are shifting to personal vehicle. Personal vehicle is used mainly diring pic hours of 10 to 7. Remaining solutions are good

6933,2023-11-08T05:12:15Z,"Banning the crackers is not the solution. Installation of smog towers in most polluted areas, promoting use of oxygenated fuels or non polluting vehicles, taking steps by providing PLI schemes for manufacturing of vehicles that run on oxygenated fuels or electric vehicles. Making use of natural resource found (lithium ion) for manufacturing of electric vehicles etc are some of the solutions that can be used instead of Banning the use of fire crackers.A single or two day use of fire crackers do not solve the pollution issue of whole year"

6939,2023-11-08T05:06:24Z,Some solution idea : Those who do the puc of their vehicle should get an offer that 1 challan in near future will be waived out. This is not a monitory burden like subsidies on government but a simple trick to attract the greed of humans.

6941,2023-11-08T05:02:52Z,"Many people in urbanuse AC for 365 days, industries pollute environment every day,  the rapid increase of private vehicles disturbed our air quality, urbanization and deforestation lead to major disturbance in nature, people waste alot of water every day in showers and washing cars, industries not only consume a lot of water but also pollute waters of rivers as the use them as sewage but all those so called secular leaders see holi and diwali to blame ,what a hypocrisy it is. These leaders burn crackers in their own family functions, allows burning of crackers on new year and Christmas but when it comes to a hindu festival they become environment experts. There will be a time when they will say don&#39;t light up candles and deepak on deepawali because the glacier will melt."

6946,2023-11-08T04:52:18Z,If pollution is cause by punjab paddy burning then why not im affected im living in punjab there is no such pollution this is biased
6947,2023-11-08T04:51:39Z,Hello Abhi and Niyu I am from haryana we have 12 acre land but we never ever do stubble burning even my family is very awared of increasing pollution the thing we do is tht we mix the stubble into the soil and it makes it more fertile also we dump or mix the organic waste also in land such as tree leaves.BTW you both are doing very great work may be all the people will not follow these solution but some like me will do definitely.I also want to suggest some solution for decreasing pollution :-1.GOVERMENT SHOULD BAN THOSE CARS IN WHICH PEOPLE TRAVELS SOLO OR IF NOT BAN THEN CAN DO ANY OTHER ALTERNATIVE.2.GOVERNMENT SHOULD ALSO RESTORE DUSTBINS IN VARIOUS SOCIAL ARES AS I HAVE SEEN VARIOUS AREAS IN MY DISTRICT PALWAL     WHERE DUSTINS ARE NOT PRESENT AND ALSO RESTORE CAMERAS PLACE TO PLACE AND TAKE STRICT ACTIONS TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO POLLUTES ENVIROMENT WE HAVE TO TAKE THESE SMALL STEPS IF WE WANT TO MAKE A GOOD IMAGE IN FRONT OF OTHER COUNTRIES OF OUR COUNTRY.
6948,2023-11-08T04:51:34Z,And that&#39;s why Village is best. In my village there are around 150+ trees and that makes the atmosphere THE BEST
6949,2023-11-08T04:51:03Z,"We should leave Delhi alone for a while. Covid period has  taught us we do not need to spend a single penny to clean this environment, we just need to leave our nature alone. We have to understand  that our nature has the capacity  to heal itself. The only thing we need to do is to stop adding harmful waste to our environment. This earth is our only home, it&#39;s  health should be our topmost priority instead of a festival, we celebrate diwali to welcome lord ram homecoming, do you think that such a celebration  would please lord ram, he will be disheartened  to see that we are runing  our mother earth to celebrate  him...We clean our houses before diwali but we throw the waste away outside, we forget that in addition  to our homes this earth is also  our home, it&#39;s  also our responsibility  to keep it clean"

6968,2023-11-08T04:28:19Z,Why always Diwali? Supreme Court is wrong on this. In 365 days 3 days of Diwali shouldn’t be blamed.
6969,2023-11-08T04:27:29Z,The only one who is responsible are  the ignorant people!!
6970,2023-11-08T04:25:51Z,I stand with supreme court decisionBecause fire crackers is also one of the major reason for pollutionBecause small step is better then nothing

6974,2023-11-08T04:23:10Z,"Actually the question is controversial. From my perspective government should maintain the production, like in wedding, in political occasion etc  the fire crackers should be ban . Childrens can use eco friendly fire crackers. They can ban plastic burning, smoking in the public places , private car usage in unneeded purposes that you said in the video. And according to many people the custom of the Diwali is burning fireworks without any limit we should spread a eco friendly custom in our next generation that may good for nature .And I appreciate your decision to plant mango trees cause its absorbs the dust from air in high quantity. I aslo planted some in my surroundings in this mango season."

6980,2023-11-08T04:13:13Z,Hire the jobless to remove the stubble immediately after harvest and recycle it. The farmers won&#39;t do it. But the companies can hire give some money to the farmers for the stubble

6986,2023-11-08T04:01:51Z,Fire crackers weren&#39;t part of our culture.. we have been using diyas from centuries
6987,2023-11-08T04:00:22Z,The better solution of burning stubble is vermi compost. Why people &amp; government didn&#39;t start a procedure to convert this stubble into manure and export it? I am from Sikkim and being a 100% organic state I see stubble are like gold... It is very costly here... Why people burning it?
6988,2023-11-08T03:59:33Z,Everything is right just in limit

6999,2023-11-08T03:50:31Z,I think they banned certain type of crackers where chemicals are used and not all crackers. Is that wrong?
7000,2023-11-08T03:49:59Z,"I think, fire crackers can be done away with….we can use more of dias, rangoli, florals…. Due to many people using fire crackers the impact intensify…. I feel the spirit of diwali should not never be done away with, we should rather do some more research for a deeper celebration, read ramayana, follow values of Rama….. specially in Delhi in this pollution, fire crackers should not be used"
7001,2023-11-08T03:48:24Z,LOVE FROM ASSAM
7002,2023-11-08T03:46:36Z,"If fire crackers are to be banned then, it must be blamed for the whole year not during Diwali only. The fashion industry must be banned (the 3rd largest polluter). Chicken, meat, and beaf also must be banned in the country(because animals also deserve life). Just targetting hindu festivals is not an option but all sources of the pollution must be banned.  After the judgement of the supreme court I am supremely dissatisfied with the soft targeting on hindu festivals."
7003,2023-11-08T03:45:39Z,Delhi is not responsible  for this. Farmers are doing this from up haryana n punjab
7004,2023-11-08T03:45:37Z,Mango is planted
7005,2023-11-08T03:43:25Z,Love you both
7006,2023-11-08T03:41:54Z,I don&#39;t know why people blame fire crackers as the cause of pollution ... They don&#39;t think of any other factors ... They just want to play the blame game but they also ultimately burst fire crackers ... If India wins any matches or its a big win many people will burst crackers ( I&#39;m not against India winning matches I am also a cricket fan ) and when any party gets elected then also they burst fire crackers ... During these times where are the activist or environmentalist  .. there is reason behind the festival and it&#39;s our responsibility to preserve it .. if we try to blame other people for pollution the supreme court or any other legal officer will let him go ... But if they blame us they are doing something for the environment.... Where&#39;s the logic ??  And it&#39;s shocking that the supreme court has given the statement to not burst fire crackers during Diwali .. very disappointed in sc for this
7007,2023-11-08T03:41:50Z,"Fire crackers are not all the problems, but it is part of the problem. Ideally this step should have been taken by the government long ago.For those who say it doesn&#39;t cause pollution, I have a minor form of asthma all my life and after Diwali I always struggle with breathing problems. There are other problems as you discussed which should be solved by the government rather than just passing the blame as well."
7008,2023-11-08T03:39:42Z,Best solution.... Work from home permanent kr do...
7009,2023-11-08T03:36:22Z,So inspiring and motivating and also solution oriented video..schools mai har sal diwali ke time teachers gives us instructions to not fire crackers because of pollution but when now in the college life knowing the reasons behind this that not only burning cracker many other reasons are also responsible for rising pollution problem ..and doing something for making environment 1% better came into mind only because of u..I always had in my mind to do something but i was not able to implement but because of ur motivation and knowledge I will give it a try...1-Planting at least one tree in a week 2-using kitchen waste for plants  3-want to plant hydroponic plants       And many more ideas...

7028,2023-11-08T03:05:34Z,First of all we all need to accept that our judicial system is at its lowest level now a days... people who deviating rules and regulations not fearing or not getting punished on time... instead they incourages bribery and the cycle goes on....as a fellow Indian there are very few people (0.1%) people I observing day to day life who adheres public laws... remaining all are stupids and nonsence...this is manor differences I found in our and any other developed nations....

7049,2023-11-08T02:22:03Z,can I ask how punjab&#39;s smoke is only polluting delhi but  not haryana or up or pakistan which are more near than delhi ? also how does smoke knows that it has to pollute delhi only ? can&#39;t it go more further ?

7053,2023-11-08T02:13:09Z,"Naah firecrackers aren’t part of our culture, i mean i understand people already bought firecrackers and govt should give some subsidy( because of late information about cracker ban) to providers and asks customers to return them to the shopkeepers. The money can be used to buy items from local and needy people to buy diwas and candles."

7056,2023-11-08T02:07:57Z,thanks for the video
7057,2023-11-08T02:02:32Z,But Milords has again banned Crackers even before Diwali to control pollution. This is the main reason there should be no reservation so that deserving people become Judges and save our Legal System
7058,2023-11-08T02:01:48Z,"Pollution ka ak aur sabasa bara factor ha jispa kai intrest hi nahi data , which is agriculture pollution , farmers farming kar ka jo crop ugata ha phir auska bad many ton of waste wo fire ma burn kar data ha in which aboundence of harmful gas released, it is due to modern technology like farmers grow rice  crop so when crop is harvested by a harvesters ( a mechine which only keep grain and west meterial throughout) so farmers give fire to the wast material, but yearly (in past time ) farmers harvest crop by his hand and the wast material is remaining, they give their animals (cow ) which is environmental Free farming."
7059,2023-11-08T02:01:18Z,I know many Delhi ppl who have moved to Mumbai and don’t wanna go back because they don’t want their kids to grow up in a polluted environment. They are ready for small apartments but won’t go back . Their wives also like the safe environment of Mumbai.
7060,2023-11-08T02:01:17Z,You will never know how I got that likes
7061,2023-11-08T01:52:13Z,It&#39;s very sad but delhi youtuber compete for brand four vehicles. Each youtuber have 2 or 3 four wheeler.
7062,2023-11-08T01:51:44Z,Abhi and Niyu thanks for letting us contribute for Mango Trees.I have sent 15-20 seeds.When you are saying they are getting planted now. Atleast one plant would be my contribution and I&#39;m happy for thatI&#39;m happy to share one more thing. We have also planted a Mango tree in our home
7063,2023-11-08T01:42:57Z,Don&#39;t ban crackers
7064,2023-11-08T01:41:19Z,I would have like this video more if you didn&#39;t justify that Diwali don&#39;t cause pollution
7065,2023-11-08T01:40:58Z,Love u for alway bringing quality with quantity
7066,2023-11-08T01:39:04Z,"Today&#39;s video just make me soo emotional at the end I almost cried ,"
7067,2023-11-08T01:38:40Z,Hats off to the two of you!  I hope this video reaches the central and state government and they start taking essential steps instead of just playing the blaim game.
7068,2023-11-08T01:36:47Z,"Stubble burning of Punjab is the main reason because rice is easier to grow than cotton because the land of punjab becoming unfertile for cotton and cotton needs more insecticides because no tress no predators. Hence government is giving free electricity for irrigation for rice hence production of more rice and more stubble , Thus punjab have no stubble processing and storage factories and farmers have no stubble packaging equipments."
7069,2023-11-08T01:36:35Z,We should try to make 10 metre Air purifier and install and  use as solar powered and we should install Big building by big houses by government
7070,2023-11-08T01:34:52Z,Attach references  with your videos
7071,2023-11-08T01:32:57Z,"Governments and people both equally responsible for the pollutionBoth should increase green areas , plants are natural purifier of air Stop burdening cities, don&#39;t go cities for every small things , and live away from cities, plant more and more and increase green areas in your nearby houses, All need to take responsibility"
7072,2023-11-08T01:26:10Z,I myself do not use firecrackers but I think banning crackers is not a solution. It&#39;s like considering a small factor of the problem as the whole problem.
7073,2023-11-08T01:21:48Z,So now Punjab is again stabbed for one more thing  thank you indians thank you ; just keep blaming farmers of Punjab and people of Punjab thnak you hindustaan ke vasiyo  Stop factories stop cars stop  buring garbage then farmers will also stop burning... but delhi will not stop still delhi will keep blaming punjab

7079,2023-11-08T00:41:53Z,This pollution is due to my neighbour who has started to celebrate dipawali a  little bit earlier days.  elite class people must have to condemn him.
7080,2023-11-08T00:22:33Z,Not burning firecrackers will have its share of benefit on the air quality. Atleast it won’t add more to the problem.
7081,2023-11-07T23:51:23Z,"Not and never brother. Not in Delhi only, fire crackers in all over india but such pollution is not such in all over India. It&#39;s being a myth that only firecrackers are the responsible."

7086,2023-11-07T22:40:41Z,Banning crackers for pollution is just like a paracetamol for cancer
7087,2023-11-07T22:39:11Z,"Why does gujrat MP BIHAR not face so much pollution. Why are governments not spraying water and charcoal based water on the open area along with pollutants control towers that were installed for crores of rupees in the last 2 years? yar 15 - 20% of total pollution is of total vehicles, which would mean if total pollution is @ 700 AQI, the 15% of 700 AQI is only105 aqi, which is actually healthy air. Yeh, DESH NHI SAMBHAL RHA HAI NA&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; BJP&quot;&quot;&quot; SE NA HI &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;AAM AADMI PARTY SEI&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;:.Bas apne offices mei baith ke meetings kr rhe hai chai samsose n sugar free pastries kha rhe hai aur bina sir pair k kanoon la rhe hai.

7088,2023-11-07T22:33:44Z,Blame Game is what GOVT do instead of Solution Finding .. Common Man is dying in Delhi .. Kejriwal is also making fool of Delhi People ..
7089,2023-11-07T22:12:00Z,"You can take this suggestion of mine..while watching this video, the thought came in my mind that we can reduce the some percentage of this big problem like the consumption of wheat and rice in our daily diet, so we should modify it. We can shift to millets like Ragi, Bajra etc and these crops do not require much water, this can also help the farmers and solve the water problem. Daily consumption of wheat and rice also increase the risk of diabetes and if we try millets in our diets, it is also beneficial for our health..this small step can be very beneficial for us in future..thank you.."
7090,2023-11-07T22:11:39Z,Remove. This girl
7091,2023-11-07T22:02:31Z,Supreme Court will not ban cigarettes and alcohol but they ban firecracker idk why
7092,2023-11-07T21:57:08Z,Great content
7093,2023-11-07T21:55:53Z,"I am not sure if this idea is being used in New Delhi, but this idea is starting to get implemented in NYC and will start working by 2024. To cut down traffic and pollution, government put hefty taxes when you enter Manhattan. This way people will start driving less and start using transport and other affordable ways to travel into the city. I want New Delhi and NCR implement this."
7094,2023-11-07T21:50:44Z,Should we start wearing a mask everytime we step out in India? I think so.
7095,2023-11-07T21:45:09Z,"diwali also worsen the scenario. It may not be main cause.Tujhe economy padhi hai, ask asthma patients. Supreme court decision is taken based on facts.I suffer every year on diwali day. By the way I am from south India."
7096,2023-11-07T21:44:45Z,"I hope this reaches each one of us and we start taking actions like not using personal vehicle if possible to start with. Also, we should start planting trees. The change should start from us."
7097,2023-11-07T21:39:18Z,Superb video finally someone stating the fact that crackers aren&#39;t the main issue. People tend to blame diwali for no reason hats off to you guys.
7098,2023-11-07T21:36:50Z,"PUC are mendatory for the vehicals adopting bs4 and bs6 ,,,,,........ but but not mandatory for old trucks. tracktors and transports ...... sabh se zada pollution unka he hai ...... transport busses are not upgraded to BS norms ....Punjab is pure not polluted ...    polluted is metro cities"
7099,2023-11-07T21:24:35Z,Biggest solution: restructure the mentality of the society.
7100,2023-11-07T21:19:19Z,Why no video about Mumbai&#39;s air pollution?What is stopping you?
7101,2023-11-07T21:06:19Z,When it rains then AQI decreases as main contribution is of PM 2.5 &amp; 10 which settle down with water droplets so i think govt should consider cloud seeding to make artificial rain then these particulate matter will settle down and AQI will improve..
7102,2023-11-07T20:53:00Z,Hey abhi and niyu.. i have to make a school project on pollution…. Can i use your content mo make a similar video .. with credits and also a few clips of yours
7103,2023-11-07T20:49:20Z,I love how u guys understood the problem and brought out the real problem which is the blame game. Its sad how such a large number of people who are well educated just love to blame these 3 days of festivities for the pollution that happens all around the year and when the same occurs in other places of the earth they sit and enjoy it. When crackers are burnt in America during 4th of July or the matter of fact any festival in any other country is fine but when it comes to our country it becomes a problem and people who start blaming are the ones who enjoy them all around the year. These 3 days we can reduce the amount of crackers burnt but banning them is just stopping u from sharing a joy which has been spread since so many years during this beautiful festival.
7104,2023-11-07T20:41:52Z,"Hi @AbhiandNiyu   I am from Delhi, I love watching your videos.  You are making very good videos about saving environment, country etc. but do not target any state government or any political party in a biased and political manner otherwise whatever you are doing will be ruined.  All states have certain limitations, dependencies and less power in different areas. Good luck for your future. Take care and stay blessed."
7105,2023-11-07T20:39:56Z,Many secular people make video on air pollution after deepawali

7109,2023-11-07T20:15:19Z,12:36 w  i can&#39;t think of any better way to explain simple things to explain to normies
7110,2023-11-07T20:13:56Z,Your last sentence “mujhe farak pdta”  gave me goosebumps     Fly high
7111,2023-11-07T20:09:47Z,Sir people think they seems so cool by not understanding these things But we should raise a step toward this mazor problemI will definitely do something about it whatever I could do

7114,2023-11-07T20:03:02Z,It&quot;s the infrastructure of delhi its blocking the aurflow in delhi it is acting like mountain and circulating the air
7115,2023-11-07T20:02:59Z,Your solution is always right but ye solution kbhi desh ke powerfull log impliment krne ki kosis ni krte hope citizens smjhe
7116,2023-11-07T19:51:33Z,This reason I pay for internet what a content

7121,2023-11-07T19:40:11Z,"10:23 completely disconnected from reality.Not a Ground Report.If you ever travel in Delhi, Gurgaon Noida sections of Dilli Metro, you will find you hard it is to travel in Metro. Delhi metro is very beneficial for a traveler but it is so so so much crowded that leave alone sitting, you don’t even get the space for standing. The connectivity is superb but the crowd is so much that people who have the money would prefer to pay 600 for a cab rather than travel for 60rs in the Delhi Metro which is a concentration chamber in itself."
7122,2023-11-07T19:40:03Z,They took decision like bann firecrackers in time of diwaliKejriwal ho tho sub mumkkin ha
7123,2023-11-07T19:35:16Z,Okay great so let&#39;s ask industries and farmers to recycle rather than burn and then we can burst crackers freely in the future
7124,2023-11-07T19:33:54Z,Government should also request to the popular Indian youtubers to make a video and explain in their own way about solutions to their viewers because most of viewers are teenagers and adults

7139,2023-11-07T19:03:39Z,"Really a good and well researched video. But I support court&#39;s order. All type of firecrackers should be banned in any festival any time whatsoever, but I agree with you we need strict action against errant industrial offenders."

7144,2023-11-07T18:55:54Z,"What if delhi comes with a policy like, every family has to have enough plants related to the pollution they produce and make it a compulsion."
7145,2023-11-07T18:53:15Z,"Hey everyone...Let&#39;s together work on solutionsI know most of us don&#39;t even live in Delhi, so why should we do anything? Because Delhi is a part of IndiaEven if we together work on solutions it will help each state and atleast reduce some pollution.. So lets discuss1. Use public transport (told in video)2. Grow more plants3. Don&#39;t use Crackers (I know many will say it does not affect that much but atleast if we will not use it won&#39;t increase more)4. By informing your family, friends and relatives, start odd even rule in your area5. Don&#39;t throw garbage outside (even 1 piece of garbage makes pollution)(we all know garbage mountain of Delhi) 6. If any of your family members or relative smoke tell them to try to leave because pollution is giving enough fragrance of cigarettes 7. Use cycle or walk for near distance, not scooty bike or car 8. I know winters is coming so hope so many of us are not using ac, if you are pls try to avoid, take a evening walk outside it&#39;s cold winds will work better than ac 9. Everyone loves sitting near woods of fire in winters but please let&#39;s avoid it some 10. Use less electricity I hope I was not rude to anyone if you felt I was, so I am sorry I am just 15 year old, so pls don&#39;t mind my words if you felt bad Take care of yourself and your family"
7146,2023-11-07T18:48:14Z,"Hey Guys, a big fan of your videos but I kinda disagree with your point that majority of the population commutes by their own vehicle to portray their coolness (might be true in some cases but not all). I am a girl and I prefer to travel by my own car because I have had such bad experiences while even commuting till the distance of metro station, Delhi is not safe. I do have my girl friends who heavily rely on public transports and fortunately have never had such bad experiences, but my reason for opting to commute by my car is because of bad experiences in the past and safety concerns. But this being a major concern I do agree that we need to think more sustainably."

7173,2023-11-07T18:22:24Z,"I always think, Government should restrict the number of vehicles a family can have so that this will somehow control the traffic and ultimately pollution in all over India.. just like we follow - HUM DO HAMARE DO , this should also be made a rule."

7177,2023-11-07T18:16:46Z,Bro you said why on Diwali why not in marriages why not in political party. Let me tell you if marriage is going  in my family my family members only use crackers. Not enter India. I hope you understand what I mean
7178,2023-11-07T18:16:17Z,"Hi AbhiandNiyu, I don’t think banning fire crackers is a solution. We need to find more productive and efficient ways to control our air pollution in Delhi and other parts of India. Banning firecrackers will not help anybody in fact it will hurt people’s sentiments emotionally and economically as Diwali comes once a year and pollution in Delhi is always around 180-300 AQI. Also, we should try to put more regulations on burning the crops."
7179,2023-11-07T18:14:31Z,"The biggest problem of our country is majority of the youth (who all are either in schools or colleges) It&#39;s sad to see how directionless, heartless, ruthless, mannerless and toxic this upcoming generation are.

7186,2023-11-07T18:08:35Z,"U had put a post that someone teased your car and u also had a camera in the car . And at 10:35 u r saying , u don&#39;t have car  ."
7187,2023-11-07T18:07:30Z,"Mere pass kuch solutions hai, rather suggestions bol sakte hai - 1. Vehicle related problem. - I am from a small town coochbehar, but I live in Kolkata for education. Here I see a lot of uppermiddle class people traveling in their own economy segment cars ( under 30 lakh, mostly costing around 10-15lakh) with one or two seats occupied. As we know these days car owing become easy for any one because of EMI system. The government should bring a plan like for private buyer companies can not sell IC cars under 30 lakh only electric or hydrogen cars can be sold. Because of this the owner ship figures will drop drastically. And all the comercial cars should be running on CNG. This way polution Will be cut down in half. Buses that runs in routes less than 100km should be swapped with elctric buses.( Obviously will take atleast 10 years). Some would argue that cars are important. No my friend its not a necessity its luxury. If I can live without car you too can. Whenever needed you just rent a electric or cng cab.2. Stubble burning. - one thing govt can do is provide the farmers with machine which can uproot those stubble. And mix that with soil. ( Basically koi machine se mitti aur stubble ko milwa do jisse wo niche ajay aur niche ka mitti upar ajay. Aur wo jo stubble ho ga wo automatically pach jayga aur fertilizer ka kam karega. Specially nitrogen fertilizer ki jarurat nehi padegi tab. 3. Increase oxygen-  very few people know that moss produce tons of oxygen. So instead of using fake grass wall for decoration in building or places. Use moss wall ( maybe some company makes or will make, this is just my idea) for decoration. Moss wall will keep your building cool too and will release a lot of oxygen into the environment.4. Industrial polution.  - look indias small and large scale industries are centralised in different hotspots of India. Govt should bring a law that will control the industrialisation of that area.  There should be a limit in the number of factory in any city and surrounding areas . If de centralisation of industries happen then many small villages, and town will also be benifited as the companies will setup plant in those areas instead of crowded urban areas."
7188,2023-11-07T18:06:57Z,Thank you
7189,2023-11-07T18:06:23Z,I agree with supreme court.
7190,2023-11-07T18:05:20Z,Now day&#39;s the main reason for Delhi pollution is burning Stubbles....and u didn&#39;t mention it
7191,2023-11-07T18:05:18Z,Banning firecracker is Jst distraction
7192,2023-11-07T18:04:58Z,I always appreciate their solution oriented approach. Hats off to you guys!
7193,2023-11-07T18:04:42Z,Water pollutants in water bodies.Pesticides &amp; chemicals absorbed by plants releases its toxicity in air.Nature giving it back to us.Happy Diwali
7194,2023-11-07T18:04:16Z,1st. Use public transport more 2nd. Plant more trees3rd. Go for electric vehicle 4th. Stop stubble burning and use jaideep Sangha sir idea And currently view the situation of Delhi right now banning crackers is good bcz currently AQI IS cross max level And it&#39;s our duty to make our earth good
7195,2023-11-07T18:04:11Z,"In addition to banning firecrackers, some things that could be banned to reduce air pollution include:  Aerosols: Aerosols use CFCs, which are air pollutants. Construction debris: The Bombay High Court ordered a temporary halt to the movement of construction debris to and from construction sites until Diwali. Old cars: Governments should tackle air pollution by banning old cars.Other things you can do to reduce air pollution include:  Reducing the number of trips you take in your car Reducing or eliminating fireplace and wood stove use Avoiding burning leaves, trash, and other materials Avoiding using gas-powered lawn and garden equipment Using public transports Turning off the lights when not in use Recycling and reusing Reducing forest fires and smoking"

7197,2023-11-07T18:03:50Z,"1.People must increase to use government transport (cng and electric) and decrease the use of personal vehicle . 2.Government also think about import export of petrolium to delhi.3.Setup 4 big solar system power plant. It decrease to make electricity from coal.4.Have a clean system like Indore 5.Ban the factory that have harmful product.6. Every family havee its own tree7. Move the all plastic recycling setup from Delhi to other state.8. Increase the rate of inport and export of fhatake.9.stubble is not a waste part . In villages stubble is eat by cows, baffelo,goat,etc10. Increase the taxe on petrol and diesel and decrease the interest rate on loan of electric cars and bikes 11.

7202,2023-11-07T18:00:12Z,I am not in support of firecrackers but if firecrackers are so bad why doesn&#39;t the government ban the production of them all year round.

7204,2023-11-07T17:59:09Z,"we as &#39;HUMANS&#39; try to find an alternative solution when a aubject, object, etc etc isn&#39;t available to us. we tend to replace it with some other form of things. if we take example of fire crackers, they are banned now, so momentarily  the supply chain will break and at some point it would be no more available to People, so we will try to find an alternate, and in that findings we may find something which is less pollutant or it could be worse who knows. but giving the chance to find it is important. why are we not bringing these little changes to our culture if it helps our own nation&#39;s People and even world&#39;s?"
7205,2023-11-07T17:58:28Z,The real problem with so-called Proud Indians is that that they thoughtki bahar wale hamare yaha ghumne aaye hai to ghume na criticise kyu kar rahe. Hamari ego bohot chhoti hai. Ek real and helpful criticism bhi nahi saha ja sakta . They will justify anything worse happening around them....
7206,2023-11-07T17:56:57Z,I think there should be lockdown for 1 or 2 day in a month in delhi and this will improve the air quality of delhi like what happened during pandemic. Lockdown means there will be no vehicles should be used on that day only cycles can be used to travel
7207,2023-11-07T17:56:31Z,Each and every year this is the big problem for India and in my point of view government playing the blame game
7208,2023-11-07T17:55:48Z,"Me n my bro planted full on garden of papaya ,banana trees in lockdown which grew into forest till 2021..but one psycho lady n our society secretary who had tiff against us purposely cut it off in front of our eyes just to revenge we LGBT community ppl.  Since then I&#39;m scared to plant even a single seed in my society to avoid heartbreak of seeing it cut n burnt anyway ..."
7209,2023-11-07T17:55:36Z,That ban is not the solution... First of all public transport in all cities should be good. Simply telling ppl to use them won&#39;t make them viable but improving them can result in several middle class families using public transport instead of expensive vehicles.
7210,2023-11-07T17:53:34Z,Lahore is also very polluted in that time by air quality
7211,2023-11-07T17:53:17Z,In future Delhi air will be poison

7215,2023-11-07T17:50:44Z,I think banning firecrackers is a very bad move by the supreme court as it will create religious aspects in people&#39;s minds and people will burn more crackers. The government should impose huge need taxes on firecrackers so most of the people are not able to afford it or if they are able to afford the quantity will be less than now
7216,2023-11-07T17:48:04Z,I don&#39;t think this problem is that simple... Problems and Solutions both are complex
7217,2023-11-07T17:47:51Z,Electric cars best option like china
7218,2023-11-07T17:47:36Z,Where there is will there is a way. Where there is no will there is only blame game.
7219,2023-11-07T17:47:05Z,This is a great message who are leaving in other cities rather than Delhi a red warning . And I promise you both I will plant trees as much as I can.

7224,2023-11-07T17:43:50Z,"Banning firecrackers is one way to make the air cleaner, but it is not enough. There are many other things that make the air dirty and harm our health. Some of these things are: 1 ) Cars and trucks that use oil and gas. They make a lot of smoke and bad gases that make us cough and breathe hard. We can use less of them and use buses, trains, bikes, or electric cars instead 2: . Factories and farms that make smoke and chemicals. They make the air smell bad and can cause diseases like cancer. We can make them follow rules to stop or reduce their smoke and chemicals 3: . Wood and cow dung that make black dust when used for cooking and heating. They make the air inside our homes dirty and can cause problems like asthma and lung infections. We can use gas, biogas, or electric stoves instead 4: . Plastic that makes bad smells when burned or thrown away. It can also harm animals and plants. We can avoid using plastic things that we use only once, like bags, spoons, and plates, and use cloth, metal, or paper things instead"
7225,2023-11-07T17:43:17Z,Don&#39;t Worry We Will Celebrate Diwali With Fire Crackers Iam From Chattisgarh And In My State Fire Crackers Is Not Banned Even Supre Court Said Across India But No One Follow This Rule
7226,2023-11-07T17:41:34Z,Thank you for your information and solutions and I always appreciated your each and every words..this video is not only for those who make pollution but for every each citizen of India those who want better environment for their upcoming generations. Thank you so much once again @AbhiandNiyu keep spreading love and good work with yours video
7227,2023-11-07T17:40:18Z,Year on year will pass nothing will change. Unless and until we common people stand together and implement these solutions. Government is trying but this time common people will also have to unite and fight against the problem.

7232,2023-11-07T17:36:22Z,Absolutely Correct
7233,2023-11-07T17:35:53Z,"so, fire crackers is not a main cause for pollution.bruh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!then, why did they ban them all over India"
7234,2023-11-07T17:35:32Z,Great job
7235,2023-11-07T17:34:52Z,"I used to own a vehicle, but later I realized that I use it often. Also, I realized that I can also use public transport for often travels, so I sold it."

7238,2023-11-07T17:30:05Z,Do you guys think AQI meters for home use are worth it? Adding a air purifier and aqi meter at home does it makes sence in Delhi NCR? Just wanted to know how many people can bear the expense of 20-30k for these devices in return of the harm it&#39;s causing to health..
7239,2023-11-07T17:29:14Z,Make a video of inflation
7240,2023-11-07T17:28:56Z,They only Target Hindu festivals but not factory
7241,2023-11-07T17:27:55Z,In odisha we feed rice husk to cows. use as a heat pillow for egg hatching. And many more thing
7242,2023-11-07T17:27:39Z,I think fire crackers ban is a good decision but it should be applied equally throughout the air. For example they can ban firecrackers starting 1 Jan and they will be banned permanently forever and not just for diwali. It will lead to a positive change in the society. Supreme court and government only start working on the problem when problem gets out of control but instead what should be done is to prevent such events happening in the first place. Other sources of air pollution should also be neutralized as well like stubble burning for example
7243,2023-11-07T17:26:54Z,Nicely explained!!! Sooo informative!!Thanks!!
7244,2023-11-07T17:26:42Z,The video that every younger stars have to watch.

7246,2023-11-07T17:25:11Z,"I think Banning crackers it&#39;s not right direction, We have to find another way (Tree plantation) Ex-Like Mini Garden ( Home trance,Balcony, wall ) it also looks amazing &amp; also reduces air pollution or other If you agree with this point ping this message."
7247,2023-11-07T17:25:06Z,Kudos for both of you
7248,2023-11-07T17:25:04Z,I think government should focus  more   on 2nd and 3rd tier cities if they will not do this delhi like situations will be in 50 more cities in coming years
7249,2023-11-07T17:25:01Z,I think Abhi &amp; Niyu are more eligible for solving such problems instead of that nonsense decisions taken by the government
7250,2023-11-07T17:24:35Z,All the Arvind Kejrival busses transportation are main cause of pollution due to Too old busses it generates more pollution.

7253,2023-11-07T17:19:28Z,I am from punjab. First biggest solution is gave subcidy on diesel price. You know the diesel price in punjab is 90 rupees. And for one acres of land to become in proper form it take almost 30 letirs of diesel. the small farmer is not to much affrodabe to spent almost 3000 diesel on 1 acre. And you think due to paddy and wheat punjab become deset . No bro due to government policy on punjab water it will become desert because of your bjp government. Dont worry just wait and watch the time of punjab coverts in khalisthan is coming soon. No punjab farmer no food.

I don&#39;t understand how and why blaming the common people of india is a solution.The issue has been there for years but the governments are not even trying solve it, they just want to live through that period in the winter.I don&#39;t agree with your statement of making more people use the Delhi public transport because we all know that it will not be enough to sustain that amount of people and it will definitely fail.Ultimately, the state and the central government need to address the situation with utmost priority.Your work is good but people should not bear consequences always."

AC itself produce hot air in environment by giving cold air We can use matka instade of freedge to keep water cold We must buy limited veges or buy it daily while coming from our work and cook limited food that we must finish in 1go Why we are cooking extra food and keeping it in freedge to eat later it&#39;s unhealthy as well as by cooking large quantity of food at once so that we don&#39;t need to cook food again for 1-2 days is just like making yourself less active and ultimately towards disease health

7281,2023-11-07T16:54:23Z,Delhi Metro can handle around 2.8 million people everyday .. while the working commuters in Delhi are over 5 million (not including people who aren&#39;t going for work rather other reasons.. as that could be much higher in number). So no public transport cannot handle it. Just a Fact Check !!
7282,2023-11-07T16:52:54Z,Trees should be plantedDo not cut trees
7283,2023-11-07T16:51:39Z,Nice and informative video. But supreme court ke decision ko directly blame  karo. Agar pahle ban kiya hota to kafi sare log case file kar dete. Last moment par ban karne se economic loss hoga but iss se diwali ke time par hone wale extra pollution ko control bhi hoga aur vyapari log is wajah se stock ko kam se kam maintain karenge. Ye ek bade revolution ki shuruwat hai.dhire dhire hi sahi events me hone wale aatish bazi par bhi lagam lagegi.

Of course, industrial pollution and vehicular emissions and other factors like crop residue burning (major one) are factors. But one has to see what augments it, what contributes a huge amount of pollution in one day - and that is Diwali cracker pollution. That&#39;s why it is important to ban them."

Impose restrictions on wealth of all politicians (ie  a politicians is allowed to hv only X acres of agricultural land , X area domestic land, X num of cars......) so that no politicians can make wealth more than  XYZ amount.8.

7390,2023-11-07T15:44:57Z,"I think in Delhi and surrounding regions the road tax should be increased. So that people follow and maintain vehicles properly.2. Car pooling/ electric buses rides -  companies/ flat association/ schools/ University should promote it .3. Use of public transportation. Reduce the peak hr prices these 2 months and add more bus/ train connectivity. So  that people are encouraged to use them.4. Promote - ebike/ e-cycle/ e-riskshaw . Give a free ride everyday - for these 2 months. 5. Specific pickup/ drop locations in city (share ride) - Uber/ ola 6. These 2 months promote work from home/ online classes- till permanent measures are taken.7. These 2 months - driving car additional toll taxes and fees. So that only on need basis people use it or restrict to use it. If more than 1 car per person registration is done ( domestic use) additional taxes for registration and getting the number plate.8. Home delivery service restrictions limit within 3~5 kms order only for these 2 months9. State/ central government need to bring immediate permanent measures in their political manifesto to this problem10. Changes in the farming sector with clearly educating farmers on new methods of farming. 11.Promoting Floriculture/ Horticulture farming as the winter season are best for flowers/ vegetables. 12. Accountability of administrative staffs, vehicle inspection staffs, agriculture minister, transport minister. Strict measures and standards to be maintained. 13.Every signal - install smoke emission sensor IR camera for monitoring vehicle pollution14. We could try cloud seeding- not sure if it would work, but experts could think about it15. Encourage scientist / environmentalist in developing scientific methods to tackle the issue. 16. ISRO should share satelite image of every day these 2 months - just like weather report- so that people know and no more blame game between states."

7406,2023-11-07T15:38:34Z,"Only these two make me believe that a better India is possible. I hope some of the senseless youth also get this kind of knowledge and actually learn something rather than fighting and trolling on instagram comment sections and watching bigg boss. These people are around you maybe your friend or colleague or neighbour  ya they might have ego and don&#39;t like to listen to anyone etc , just confront them on the points you believe in and try to make them understand positives of the things , because encouraging and ignoring this bad behaviour and toxic masculinity is damaging for India (masculinity is a behaviour trait and set of attributes in all genders, we all have a masculine side and a feminine side). Lastly just want to say Fight your addictions and distractions, try to note down rough routines and follow them and list down and focus on your goals. (I will try and I hope you will too)"
7407,2023-11-07T15:38:31Z,I liked your videos but let me tell you something.. I belong to a agricultural family.. reasons for stubble burning- a) govt. Koi step nahi leti h jiss se waste ko manage Kia jaa sakeb) vaise bhi agricultural cost bahot jada hoti h rice ki and second agar stubble ko kahi bhi dete h like factories and all toh voh Humm se hi charge krte h so vaise bhi cost increase hoti h fir farmers k pass kuch nahi bachta becz unhe next crop cultivation k liye bhi paise chaiyec) police corrupt h toh voh koi action nahi leti ...           Aap ek baat btayien ki abhi dashhera per itne Ravan jalaaye logo ne uss time kisi ne kisi ko name nahi Kiya.. uss se bhi toh bahot pollution hua tha even ki uss ki koi zarurat nahi thi voh toh kahi beneficial bhi nahi tha.. yeah stubble burning toh ek need h for the next crop but what about RAVAN DAHAN.. log usse dekhne aaye toh vehicles ka pollution and the dahan main crackers ka pollution.. what about that
7408,2023-11-07T15:38:30Z,Brother I&#39;m in that 1% . Informative video
7409,2023-11-07T15:37:47Z,They are not blaming Diwali. But firecrackers during Diwali could contribute to the already hazardous air quality. Banning firecrackers could minimise the pollution. This is not against any celebration.
7410,2023-11-07T15:37:18Z,I feel so positive about my country reason is your video thank you
7411,2023-11-07T15:37:14Z,"Hey guys, you are doing a fabulous work and I follow all your videos. I just wanted to give a suggestion as a viewer that if you guys start talking more on the solution rather than discussing problems, it would be great just because people already knew all the negative things either from television or newspaper or any other media items. This has become a pattern where people just focus on the issues and then they will go into their own world to discuss it further. So if you can give one third of your video on problems and then two3 of your videos on solution part, it would be great. Thank you and all the best."
7412,2023-11-07T15:37:01Z,Farmers of Haryana and Punjab are responsible for this mess.

7417,2023-11-07T15:34:58Z,Banning fire crackers for pollution is like giving paracetamol to a cancer patient
7418,2023-11-07T15:34:05Z,"they only try to target diwali every year, it&#39;s really funny to see restrictions on Hindu festivals in Hindustan, if we can&#39;t practice our culture in our own country then where we will?"
7419,2023-11-07T15:33:35Z,"I think problems with bursting crackers in Diwali is the scale and amount at which it is done. As it happens across India in almost every home on the same day , it contributes to air pollution significantly and that may be the problem.. Otherwise on other occasions , firecrackers are not bursted in such huge amount.."

We have been facing loss back three years there are so many problems to do farming and if we grow whet we can take little good price you should research again. government doesn&#39;t attention on farmers.farmer is daying.
7431,2023-11-07T15:31:27Z,Such a solution oriented video....I feel like you guys should start a campaign or a meetup where every subscriber should plant a tree in every state and we need a reel on a which plant produces more oxygen and purifies the air so that every individual can plant that..And that will be so helpful for a local vendor and will help him to earn more profit this diwali
7432,2023-11-07T15:31:08Z,I don&#39;t think that banning firecrackers is the only solution. There are so many other activities involved in increasing air pollution in delhi. I think construction is a much bigger culprit behind Delhi&#39;s air pollution.
7433,2023-11-07T15:31:05Z,I’m gonna plant a tree rather than fire a cracker this diwali jai hind

7465,2023-11-07T15:14:38Z,I think personally no have any problem with celebrating diwali...but situations are such that we must avoid using fire crackers which will only increase the scale of air pollution. I heard in old day&#39;s we used to celebrate Diwali with Diyas ....so lets celebrate our Diwali with diyas instead of fire crackers.

Delhi have over 20 million people, densely populated , and even the winds are not too strong to gush out the damm smoke.... best practice for delhi is artificial winds and rain.. which gonna calm down this smoke... otherwise no matter what... being 1000s of miles away from ocean is a disadvantage for delhi and its gonna be forever untill something bigger comes out"

Government buses are mostly lying faulty. It can be verified from various bus depots. Situation has been doctored over a period of time to ensure profit to private players, cab companies, vehicle manufacturers,etc for increasing revenues and party fund. I think you should cover the present problems of Public transport in Delhi NCR. I belong to Delhi. In 2000-2002, the bus facilities were wonderful, hardly 10-20 persons used to travel without seat even during peak hours. All bus routes were well covered using DTC Kilometre scheme buses, blue line and red line buses, etc.Pl think over it.Thanks"

It almost feels like the end of the world! If it weren&#39;t for Niyu, Abhi and Team; the worry would, I&#39;m sure consume many young people like me who can&#39;t bear to look at the state of Delhi!

7687,2024-11-27T21:20:25Z,"The amount of racism and hate against indians in the comments is too much. I agree the mentallity of Indians is disgusting and that no one cares about true development but still.. Have some shame, did you forget how London was very polluted before too. And for those who blame BJP they have done way more development in 10 years than congross did in its 70 years of rule"

You will definitely findThe pollution is because of the burning of crops or parali in wintertime by the punjabis or nearby areas which causes pollution, but at the end we are responsible"

7736,2024-11-25T06:11:33Z,This is what happens when every political party in the country is corrupt &amp; everyone hides from taking accountability for a crisis. Name one positive thing happening &amp; every frikin politician in the country will relate themselves to it.

7740,2024-11-25T01:21:13Z,"we indians cannot blame government for all of this, we as a society are doomed, youth dont care about morals and being a good citizens, our ancestors and seniour from whom we got raised up didnt cared about morals and society themselves they just were lying about being good, they are the main cause of why old mentally still runs in modern world, they are quick to blame others while defending themselves, and our generation surely got this trait of blaming others worser than our seniors, so i dont know what we can do until we actually realise climate conditions or just create strict laws that would prohibit us from polluting the environment"
7741,2024-11-25T00:33:07Z,"I still remember when I traveled from Bhutan to Delhi, the change of air quality was so different that it made me sick"

7747,2024-11-24T17:18:05Z,Half of the commenting dogs here don&#39;t know the actual reason of this pollution occuring only in winters due to stubble burning and temperature inversion.
7748,2024-11-24T14:48:20Z,Those diwali fireworks main reason
7749,2024-11-24T14:31:17Z,Man as a Pakistani we couldn&#39;t win here either. Welp at least India won something.
7750,2024-11-24T13:48:11Z,&quot;Let&#39;s dump poop and toxic waste into our so called &quot;holy&quot; rivers&quot; - India

Instead of doing some changes, they will make comments like India is shame like country will grow on it&#39;s own without the help of countrymen....later they will drive their vehicle which didn&#39;t get tested for smoke and will throw throw their garbage here and there or in drains, will throw spite (saliva) in the wall and will pee in the corner"
7752,2024-11-24T12:46:24Z,"Many people talked about pollution, but people in our country just call them anti national and ignore them. If we talk about accepting the problem, these people be like &quot;how dare you say this about your own country&quot;. How can a problem be solved if we dont accept it? And so problem never gets solved. I am fade up of these people. So I am just thinking that &quot;Let them face these consequences of not solving problems and I will studyand just go live in abroad&quot;."
7753,2024-11-24T10:59:01Z,Who cares when Delhi people can&#39;t care enough

7757,2024-11-24T04:49:05Z,Meanwhile Indian media busy on Israel issue  pathetic
7758,2024-11-24T04:40:29Z,"I am sorry to say this.  India is HELL on earth.  India is always one big trash dump.  And now it is one big GAS CHAMBER.  I also noticed that Indians like to TALK, yet never bother to bend and pick up one piece of trash.  Why would you want to blame the government?  Just blame yourself!  You, yes, you, you typing in YT, you, is RESPONSIBLE.  You are the reason why India is HELL.  You TALK and never do anything.  Indians!"

7763,2024-11-23T18:55:06Z,"Population=pollution, Smart people Live in cites abd poor people Live in india villages"
7764,2024-11-23T17:18:48Z,This calamity started with the eviction of poor villagers and the usurpation of their land by force at very low prices in Noida. There is nothing organic about the creation of Delhi-NCR. Agricultural land was taken by forced evictions then given at throwaway prices to developers and builders who went on to create projects via high levels of public borrowing at subsidized rates of interest. What followed was sheer loot of the public exchequer via diversion of public funds and long delays or incomplete projects. Now we are left with vast swathes of residential buildings often with shoddy construction concentrated in a very small area. The level of economic activity may or may not justify the level of residential construction yet it continues.  Instead of promoting rural development in villages through education and better access to healthcare and sanitation we simply uprooted them. We asked for this nightmare and we&#39;ve got it. The curse of the evicted and the callous stupidity of the state.
7765,2024-11-23T14:13:02Z,"India now has the most polluted air, the most polluted river and dirtiest city in the world"

7855,2024-11-20T12:29:46Z,"I could not have anticipated the amount of belligerent racism, bigotry and disrespect that I’d get to see in these comments. Do you folks think that Delhi - the tiny city that’s surrounded by hundreds of square kilometers of agricultural land that undergoes seasonal crop burning - could have had a big role to play in either causing or containing the air pollution? Yeah I didn’t realize that no one would bother to know how or why this situation has happened, most of yall are just brain-rotted trolls who sit behind your computer screens and make a day out of taking a dump on the Internet. I didn’t see a single comment expressing empathy for the residents of Delhi who have to put up with this nonsense because they’re powerless against the large intensive- farming communities that surround the capital territory. And the BBC never fails to show up whenever they get the chance to make most of the hardships that people around the world are facing. I’m not saying that they should not report on this - by all means, it’s essential that they bring light to stuff like this, in hope that it might nudge politicians to do something about it. But journalism is more than saying “this place is polluted” and calling it a day - not that I expect much out of BBCs brand of “journalism”."

7963,2024-11-18T19:06:43Z,Not surprising in a country that values cows more than humans. Pretty sure the cows aren&#39;t having a great time in Delhi either

7973,2024-11-18T16:45:10Z,Man isn’t it funny how the government’s actions in these situations is to ask the people to do better while the government goes ahead not really taking a proactive action to solve the problem. The people will also go ahead to accept this as the fact of life no matter how much impact this will have on people’s health. It’s like like the Indian citizens living in that area will accept whatever fate is given to them which is really funny. Like sure everyone agrees that there are problems but no one will get out of their house and actually protest to get what they want. No wonder British was able to colonize India so easily.

Now dramatic measures are required. Delhi just cant support massive influx of people frm neighbouring states. People brings in massive carbon print as well. Atleast few states like Punjab, Maharashtra has better farming and green cover which reduces the effect while dehli hasnt got any. Since there is hardly any land. Imagine all the trafic frm Punjab, Haryana, UP, etc etc comes through delhi along with people."

As the British looted india for almost 200 years, we have the right to re-construct ourselves again in at least 90 years.....I know that Delhi&#39;s AQI is bad  but it is not an international headline, it will be cleared within 2-3 weeks, Government has imposed GRAP-3 in NCR, just go and research on it......just look at the geography man."

Lots of farming related burning’s around city4. Poor road conditions, many areas of construction dust,bridges 5. Overpopulated 6. Traffic jams  All these contributes to this problem"

Hindus are the biggest alcoholics in India and are the cause of most of the drink-driving-related road fatalities!

8324,2024-11-15T13:35:04Z,"I used to stay in Delhi NCR as a kid till 2012. There was barely any air pollution back then. Returned to Gurgaon last year and I was saddened by the change in the last decade. All the pollution fiasco started in 2014-15 and unfortunately the blame game between Delhi govt and central govt has horribly transformed Delhi’s as well as India’s image. The right kind of measures are never even discusses, let alone be implemented and instead common man is made to suffer by banning BS3/4 vehicles on the road even though they have passed the  mandatory PUC check to be deemed fit to run on the road. I hope some sane person takes control of this situation and we do not normalise this as a living standard. We have been raising awareness regarding this since ages but nothing has happened yet. If this continues, then in the next decade or two, Delhi would be unlivable and that’s unfortunate for a city that has a rich source of history and is of course the capital of the fastest growing nation in the world."

It&#39;s absolutely disheartening how horrifying the pollution levels are in the city. But no heed was given to the fact that pollution levels have actually decreased since last year( not as cold, stubble burning was somewhat controlled). Delhi&#39;s air is polluted as f***.

8379,2024-11-15T11:11:41Z,"&quot;Delhi&#39;s pollution crisis is a classic example of putting too many eggs in one basket. Despite having adequate infrastructure, people suffer daily due to unbearable traffic jams, lack of parking, overcrowded roads, inadequate public transport, and rising pollution levels. Adding to this is the lack of civic sense among citizens, further worsening the chaos.Take the period between Deepavali and Chhath Puja as an example — roads are empty, and pollution levels drop significantly. This proves how much of Delhi’s population is migrant. So why can’t the government take bold steps to decentralize? Shift non-essential offices and organizations to smaller towns across India.Delhi, as the capital, can host essential offices, but the rest can operate from anywhere, just as ISRO thrives in Bangalore and successfully launched Chandrayaan. Pilani, a remote Rajasthan village, earned global recognition with BITS. Decentralization will not only reduce the pressure on Delhi but also foster development in smaller towns. Bold action is overdue — decentralize, redistribute, and relieve Delhi.&quot;#DelhiPollution #DecentralizeDevelopment #SustainableGrowth"

8409,2024-11-15T10:16:26Z,"Went to Delhi in the winter last year. I was on the verge of suffocating the entire time. It’s like breathing cigarette smoke 24/7. The smell soaks into your skin, your clothes you CANNOT escape it. Gets worse at night when homeless people burn trash to stay warm. It’s like the city’s permanently engulfed in fog because of the toxic fumes from burning plastic and fabric. When you sneeze there’s this black soot thing? coming out your nose  I’ve never seen anything like it. Got the worst sore throat in my life it felt I was swallowing fire every time I breathed. Absolutely no concept of health or cleanness"

8460,2024-11-15T08:50:47Z,"ISKCON is an Indian terrorist organization. The Indian government carries out its terrorist activities in different countries through ISKCON. Recently, the Indian government has also used ISKCON behind the murder of a Sikh leader in Canada, which Canada has caught. This Indian terrorist militant group ISKCON should be banned from every country. Moreover, the Indian government is attacking Muslims&#39; houses in Jammu and Kashmir and various Muslim-dominated areas of India. In Assam, the houses of about 50/60 families have been vandalized, which the Indian government prohibits from showing in the media. This Hindutva India is the one that oppresses Muslims the most, in which the Indian government is directly involved."

8463,2024-11-15T08:46:26Z,Overpopulation and illiteracy are biggest problem of india and all other problems are due to these two reasons.
8464,2024-11-15T08:38:47Z,"Its unfortunate.... That we .. people of different countries don&#39;t converge on human grounds for the problems that are of collective human concerns.. we blame each other ..  We can blame in political matters.. yes.. in particular context of india and pakistan here.. (even though, i differ to that also. We must have discussion and public engagements.. but i guess we are not evolved as being this mature)But this climate issue, I feel is pushing us to converge our concerns collectively.  This threat we individually countries have done with ourselves, within our counties but it does have negative impacts on each other too..Water, air, earth, fire ....  Meaning the nature do not go in obedience to man-made political borders.. they go beyond that and are connected througout the world.. In a nutshell.. this issue is of concern for both India and Pakistan .. and it must be taken as one.."

The toxic work culture. the government doesn&#39;t care about people and is corrupt. The population is booming and the cities are becoming unliveable. The taxes are rising. Inflation is at an all time high and rising continuously. And the govt doesn&#39;t seem to care much. Instead, the govt is encouraging people to work seven days a week instead of five days, the worst govt."

Don&#39;t know why these idiots can&#39;t understand that the festival can be celebrated without damaging or polluting the environment. I have been living in delhi since childhood and I&#39;m 21 now. I had to say it wasn&#39;t this serious of a problem 7 or 8 years ago, AQI level wasn&#39;t used to being as bad as it is now. Needless to say, Delhi, despite the capital, is filled with idiotic people that are already beyond saving (how much you would tell them it&#39;s bad, nobody would listen or care since it doesn&#39;t harm them directly or immediately)There are many who are suffering, young and old, just like me, but who cares? It&#39;s the festival, we ((every fkn house)) have to burn firecrackers for a reason I wouldn&#39;t dare say ((comment will be deleted, I know))I&#39;m already planning on leaving the country asap, or else I would go crazy, which I&#39;m sure as hell won&#39;t take too long.— from agnostic me."

They have been doing everything for the past several years to stop the local govt from working for the betterment of Delhi, including depriving the local govt of its tax share and snatching away its powers.Delhi, a city state, is surrounded by three large provinces, all of which are run by the same political party as that in the Centre and all of them are allowing stubble burning by farmers which has been a major reason for spreading of smog in Delhi.Delhi govt&#39;s measures such as ban on fire crackers during Diwali, ban on non essential construction activities during this season, etc. are not being implemented on ground by Delhi police because Delhi&#39;s police department comes under the Centre."

8716,2024-11-15T04:09:20Z,"I lived in China when it was horrible there (Beijing) and I can testify it&#39;s the worst. I recall a pregnant lady walking into our office wearing an advanced mask, at that point I hadn&#39;t seen such masks ever. Soon, while looking outside my office but not able to see 50 meters far, I realized it was time to buy a mask myself. I felt that the air inside the mask was almost as horrible as the air outside. I felt like I could almost taste the outside air, and the &quot;filtered air&quot; inside my mask was not only smelly but also moisty. Whenever I took off my mask I had the lines imprinted on my face. However, what was the worst about it, was that (just like during COVID) you didn&#39;t get to see people&#39;s expressions. With everyone&#39;s faces hidden, there were no friendly encounters on the street. I almost felt like I was in a country inhabited by robots where it was each to themselves. We will only know later on what the toll of living in pollution for years will truly be. My heart goes out to all who have to live in such conditions,, often without protection such as masks and air purifiers, neither health insurance."

8835,2024-11-15T01:59:00Z,"Delhi and Lahore got some otherworldly pollution. Today, Lahore got 770 followed by Delhi with 629. The next most polluted city, Dhaka, seems rather clean compared to them with 191. What&#39;s most striking to me is how basically nobody who&#39;s out is wearing a mask. In China, whenever pollution gets bad, people aware of the health risk and put them on but in India, I never seen anyone do it which makes it even worse."
8836,2024-11-15T01:58:25Z,India will always complain. And Indians won’t do a damn thing. These same idiots will ignite fireworks for Diwali.

8931,2024-11-14T23:28:43Z,"Hello, I was wondering, if I can share with you the most important thing ever.  God the Father sent His holy Son Jesus to earth, to be born of a virgin.  He grew up and died on the cross for our sins.  Then He was put into a tomb for 3 days, after that Abba Father raised Jesus to life.He appeared to people, and went back to heaven.  We all must sincerely receive Jesus into our life to be God&#39;s child. John 1:12 says: &quot;But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name&quot; Will you today genuinely by faith receive Jesus into your life for salvation?"
8932,2024-11-14T23:19:53Z,And why? They burn fossil fuels. Why Trump can’t put 2 and 2 together wanting to get America back to oil is just idiotic.

This is an insane point to achieve, for forgoing economic progress is in itself really dangerous for public health. Not saying they have a good or great economic system right now, but it would collapse if they would try to fix this. But it might still be worth it."

8970,2024-11-14T22:26:06Z,"The government needs to find ways to cut pollution. While they are doing that,  they could use giant air purifiers strategically placed at different heights throughout their cities. It might take a while for the air to clear, but it could help a lot. All they would have to do is replace filters as needed and have a cleaning schedule. It would create more jobs, manufacturing them, planning the locations, and the continuous upkeep. They could use independent energy, where it recharges its battery as it runs. It might seem too  simple, but sometimes, simple works."
8971,2024-11-14T22:25:41Z,Look at that iconic honking. Noise pollution as well.
8972,2024-11-14T22:25:35Z,gov should build huge air purifiers in 10 locations in that city

8982,2024-11-14T22:18:28Z,Imagine if India used all the money they spent on a rocket to the moon on pollution or poverty. At least the got a ship onto a giant rock in the sky. Way to go guys!
8983,2024-11-14T22:09:50Z,Why don&#39;t we charge the people in the UK per mile and start taxing electric cars and bring in congestion charges......that will fix everything right?
8984,2024-11-14T22:09:48Z,Well why no one raised the matter of stubble burning in Haryana and Punjab? It contributes about 50% of Delhi&#39;s pollution.
8985,2024-11-14T22:08:44Z,Imagine the smell
8986,2024-11-14T22:04:37Z,You pay for water and now you’ll pay for air.   Just walk around in a HAZMAT suit with oxygen tanks.
8987,2024-11-14T22:03:10Z,Don’t worry the pollution will be sucked up and out into outer space.  They don’t teach this in school.
8988,2024-11-14T22:00:04Z,India the worlds biggest hypocrisy
8989,2024-11-14T21:59:45Z,Remember: Indians are convinced other nationalities are jealous of them. Let that sink in.

LA had smog,  i remember when Air quality was bad back in the dayz, u can see it in movies but it&#39;s cleaned up i think."
8998,2024-11-14T21:44:18Z,Modi promised to build 400 million toilets for indians to use in the next 10 years.Water and pipes will be available around 2050 give or take
8999,2024-11-14T21:41:21Z,And with that India proves the title &quot;India ki maah Ka bhosda&quot; or in short IKMKB given to her
9000,2024-11-14T21:40:21Z,"I was walking across kathmandhu&#39;s big ring road once and the pollution was just terrifying. I held my breath and ran to get across and away. Later, an indian I met told me it was nothing compared to delhi. I don&#39;t know how people can tolerate it. Creeping numbness and death."

9008,2024-11-14T21:32:21Z,"I was in India last week. The moment I landed, I felt like I needed an oxygen mask."
9009,2024-11-14T21:32:08Z,"Whoa... Complete overhaul needed. Have to rebuild the city, ground up. Obviously, with that kind of traffic, engineering any half measures will only ever be a temporary patch. You need layered transit systems for large scales. Small efficient ones for the daily grind. E cars/bikes are great with controlled environments. Cut road sizes in half and enclose them. Now, you can build all manner of features into the road or whatever without the weather being a bother. Buses, trolleys, even freight could work on their own dedicated lines. I think everyone needs ro start thinking vertically about growth. The more miles you need to cover in dirty ways, the more damage we do to everything. Spend/build while you&#39;ve the health to do so. A nation struggling up the steps of their own homes, won&#39;t stand for long."
9010,2024-11-14T21:30:37Z,Racist BBC did not report who Lahore took over as the most polluted city when that happened.
9011,2024-11-14T21:28:46Z,"China when through similar phase, but they were able to deal with it swiftly and now China&#39;s air quality is much much better. I don&#39;t see how India can get itself out of this."

9017,2024-11-14T21:16:55Z,It sounds very familiar to China 20 years ago. Now China has a lot of EV and other renewable energy.  China was labeled “overcapacity” now

9020,2024-11-14T21:15:23Z,China and India are the weak links in keeping the planet alive. Maybe we will evolve to breathe plumes from tire fires. Humans are parasites and both countries don’t believe in contraceptives bc they make up almost 40% of the worlds population
9021,2024-11-14T21:14:52Z,"I once walked from a metro station in delhi to my destination, it wasn&#39;t even 1 km but i saw 4 types of poop on the street, human, dog, cow and monkey"

9024,2024-11-14T21:12:53Z,"Really shames me that we are not able to solve this issue aggressively.We Indians might mock other nations who aggressively punish those responsible and even try experimental technologies to combat pollution.It’s seriously a life and death situation.Car odd even scheme,car lifespan reduction,promoting ev,surroundings state stubble burning- enough of these,these are simply punishing middle classes and blame game.instead improve public ev fleet via ev buses and short distance ev transport.a complete overhaul of the transport system if possible.punish industries who are causing these and ask them to shift to other states and meet proper compliances.The real thing of improving forest cover or such is not being done in such a way that meets even the eye.This government shows a facade of being iron fisted one but while making such things that improve citizens they do nothing.And since it is a national interest ask the state govt and central govt to implement it via a common platform and so that no one can complain that the other one is not working.enough of the bullshit that power is split.both central and state govt (ncr) are equally responsible.Take Responsibility"
9025,2024-11-14T21:12:27Z,BBC News comments try not to be hitler levels of racist challenge (impossible)

9032,2024-11-14T21:00:01Z,"By all means, Canada, USA, Australia etc, keep importing people from this country who live in such disgusting environments. That will surely be a net positive for the natives of those countries."
9033,2024-11-14T20:59:55Z,"This comment section Is the west this dumb?  Western countries have the same issues 50-60 years ago. How did they solve it? The greatest Scientific brains and balls were scratched and they finally figured it out!Shift factories to developing nations. India,China,Pakistan,Bangladesh,Brazil and many others. Let them deal with it. Now 50-60 years later, what do their dumb kids do? They spread their chauvinist attitude on a comment section against a country that fulfills their nation&#39;s materialism.These people just need a reason for hate.  No wonder the population is declining. No child would want a environment where hate mongering against a different culture is normal."

They must stop building and financing more coal fossil fuels power plants. Time to go all in on wind and solar energy, battery storage and electric vehicles. Fossil fuels are a bad investment for people and the planet.Investors are divesting from fossil fuels. wind and solar energy investing is growing.The cost of dealing with the impact of climate change will be greater than the cost of reducing the impact.The world population is expected to grow by another billion people.

9123,2024-11-14T19:47:55Z,"In the 1970s and &#39;80s, the Los Angeles region in the US often saw more than 200 bad-air days a year, with ozone levels exceeding 300 parts per billion on the smoggiest summer days. Better quality vehicles with emissions control devices have improved things but today we have a perfect solution available, electrify everything. The technology exist and others around the world are proving it not only works but green energy is the lowest cost to produce."
9124,2024-11-14T19:47:27Z,"In every major city in the world, there are traffic jams.  A lot of the cars here, and I&#39;m guessing everywhere else, have ONE person in each one.  People who want to commit suicide, start their car in the garage with the door closed.  The Earth is covered by an o-zone layer, blocking the hydrogen monoxide.  Trees help out in cleaning the air, but if they can&#39;t keep up, we are committing suicide. People just don&#39;t put two and two together and realize that driving your car is contributing to bad air quality.  Cities are getting bigger, the population of the planet is increasing, and the number of cars on the roads is out of control.  And, by the way, electric cars are NOT the solution."

When material and labour is put a side for projects government employees, and project managers line their own pockets with the money.  The majority of members of parliament are in cahoots with these billionaires and upper classes who pay hardly any taxes and hide their money in Swiss bank accounts, but they are good at making rural farmers, and the working class pay their taxes or they threaten to take away anything they do have. Thousands of debt ridden men from these rural communities comitt suicide or drink themselves to death every year which are never reported by government officials. The country has no law and order,  fat police officers with bloated bellies walk around with sticks doing next to nothing but taking bribes and networking to get a promotion for themselves and their family acquaintances.
