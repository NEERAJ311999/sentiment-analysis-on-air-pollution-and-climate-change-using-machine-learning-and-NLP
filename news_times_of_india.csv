The decision, announced on Wednesday (January 15) by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), comes after a rapid deterioration in air quality across the region, pushing the Air Quality Index (AQI) into the 'Severe+' category.
If reports are to go by, all measures outlined in GRAP Stages I through IV will now be implemented without delay. Stage IV is the most stringent level of the action plan, and includes additional curbs aimed at mitigating pollution levels and preventing the AQI from worsening further.
Key restrictions:
BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel cars (4-wheelers) are restricted in Delhi and nearby NCR districts.
Medium and heavy diesel vehicles registered in Delhi (BS-IV and below) are banned, except those involved in essential services.
Light Commercial Vehicles from outside Delhi, except EVs, CNG, or BS-VI diesel, cannot enter the city unless carrying essential goods or services.
Trucks running on LNG, CNG, electric power, or BS-VI diesel are allowed to enter Delhi.
Truck entry into Delhi is prohibited, except for those carrying essential goods or services.

Education:
Physical classes may be suspended for all students, with possible exceptions for classes 10 and 12.

Work-from-home guidelines:
NCR state governments and the Delhi government may allow 50% of employees in government, municipal, and private offices to work remotely.
The central government will decide whether its employees can work from home.
The air quality in Delhi had shown signs of improvement earlier in January due to a spell of rainfall, prompting the CAQM to revoke Stage III restrictions on January 12. However, the respite was short-lived as pollutants surged again, particularly in the past week, necessitating the return of stricter controls.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution was responsible for nearly 4.2 million premature deaths in 2018 alone.
Although the connection between air pollution and serious respiratory and cardiovascular diseases is established, research continues to reveal other adverse effects of air pollution on brain health, especially in children and the elderly.
Effects on brain health
Exposure to polluted air for an extended period has increasingly been associated with neurodegenerative diseases like dementia. Short-term exposure has been associated with reduced daily productivity, declining attention spans particularly in children, and headaches.

Research studies involving MRI found that aging brains that had high concentrations of pollutants combined with fog show structural brain changes and atrophy. In the study of animals, such effects were detected before the condition develops to dementia. Researchers have found that air pollution also leads to neuron inflammation and oxidative stress, factors contributing to neurodegenerative disease and psychiatric illness such as anxiety and depression.
Short-term exposure health effects
Even brief exposure to polluted fog can result in noticeable health impacts, including:
Frequent headaches.
Reduced concentration and attention span.
Difficulty focusing on tasks.
Steps to Mitigate Health Risks
To address the health hazards posed by air pollution and fog, both collective and individual actions are essential:
Public and policy-level measures
Reduce emissions by promoting eco-friendly public transportation.
Limit the burning of garbage and agricultural waste.
Enforce stricter regulations on vehicles and industries to curb pollution.
Personal Protective Measures
Wear mask with filters for fine particulate if air quality is bad
Outdoor recreation may need to be limited on extremely polluted days
Ensure proper ventilation within indoor space and add HEPA cleaners
Follow antioxidant and anti-inflammatory diet high in such things as leafy greens, berries and fish in support of a healthy brain
Call to action
With increased pollution by air and compounded by fog, the danger to public health has increased alarmingly. This requires a combined approach by governments, industries, and people to reduce the risks and protect vulnerable groups. It can be achieved by implementing preventive measures and enhancing cleaner environments that reduce the long-term health impact and increase overall well-being.

American tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson, famous for his anti-aging ventures, has been making headlines as of late due to his reactions toward the India air pollution crisis. Via X tweet, Johnson stated that using the imagination in applying solutions to the problem of air pollution in India might have a greater effect on increasing life expectancy than finding a cure for cancer. His statement highlighted the grave environmental challenge India is facing, and he also gave practical advice on how to minimize exposure to pollution.
Bryan Johnson's involvement in India's air pollution discussion highlights the interconnected nature of environmental and health issues. By promoting solutions like air purifiers and N96 masks, he stresses the need for immediate actions in polluted environments.
Bryan Johnson shares solutions to combat pollution in India

In the video accompanying his tweet, Johnson's associate explained the measures they took during their stay in Mumbai to minimize the effects of poor air quality. To track the air quality, they carried a portable device so that they were aware of the pollution levels around them. They avoided exposure to the unhealthy air by not visiting the gym because of its poor air quality. They kept car windows shut, relied on air conditioning in their rooms to circulate clean air, and wore N96 masks when they ventured outside. His colleague even carried portable air filters wherever they went to make sure that fresh air was constantly available to counter the pollution that was being constantly thrown their way.

Johnson highlighted air pollution's impact on health and life expectancy

Johnson's tweet and video offered not just solutions but also highlighted the severity of air pollution in India. He said that more health benefits would come from efforts by the country to fight air pollution than from the discovery of a cure for cancer. The comparison serves to underscore the imperative of urgent action, since air pollution is a silent killer affecting millions of people in India, cutting their life expectancy short and causing all sorts of health problems. The message of Johnson is a wake-up call for this issue on a national scale to save more lives.
Mixed reactions to Bryan Johnson's measures advised

Some people on Twitter found some of the protective measures he advised to be over-the-top, such as carrying a portable air purifier. A user even proposed some more practical policy changes: installing air filters in all businesses, more public campaigns on mask use, planting more trees, and giving subsidies to electric vehicles to reduce pollution. This is a growing sentiment for systemic change in tackling the pollution problem.
The comment by other users about taking pollution seriously is to say that fresh air is a right and not a privilege. It points out that air pollution, besides being a health issue, also relates to socioeconomic aspects wherein the vulnerable section of the population cannot access even temporary solutions.

NGO Watavaran analysed air quality data for Mumbai from Nov 1 to Dec 31 last year. For PM2.5, 60ug/m3 is the safe limit and for PM10 it is 100ug/m3. Monitoring units have been put up at the 30 locations by govt agencies, including the BMC and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board.
Borivali East, which encompasses the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, and Malad West experienced hazardous air quality levels for 90% of the monitored period, while Bandra-Kurla Complex and Navy Nagar in Colaba exceeded safety limits for 87% of the monitored days, said Bhagwan Kesbhat, CEO, Watavaran.
Other areas which experienced high pollution levels for over 60% of the days monitored include Byculla (67% of the days), Deonar (74%), Ghatkopar (79%), Kandivali (82%), Chembur (84%) and Kherwadi in Bandra East (80%).

Kesbhat said industrial activity due to the presence of oil refineries and a thermal power station within the city limits was one of the reasons for high pollution levels in Chembur and Deonar. Construction, vehicular emissions, and bakeries and restaurants using wood for burning were among the reasons at other locations. Navy Nagar, Colaba has seen a significant rise in vehicular traffic, he said.
Mohsin Khan, senior project officer, Watavaran, said the current cool weather in Mumbai meant there was no wind circulation, resulting in particulate matter hanging in the air. ""The unseasonal rains in the second week of December helped bring down the pollution levels, providing temporary relief, but the overall trend remains deeply concerning,"" he said.
Khan said the findings are worrying because PM 2.5 particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, posing severe health risks to residents. ""The persistent high levels we are seeing across multiple locations indicate a systemic problem that requires immediate intervention,"" he said.
Kesbhat said the MPCB and the BMC must develop location-specific action plans for high-risk areas and ensure strict enforcement of dust control measures at construction sites."

The study, led by two professors at the institute, identified the Ficus benghalensis (banyan) as the most effective species for air pollution control, acting as a keystone species. Other species such as Azadirachta indica (neem) and Bauhinia purpurea (orchid tree) also play a significant role in reducing pollutant levels in various locations.
The study, led by two professors — Pankaj Singh, scientist-D (group coordinator - reasearch) and Bharati Patel, scientist-C (forest ecology & climate change) at the institute, identified the Ficus benghalensis (banyan) as the most effective species for air pollution control, acting as a keystone species. Other species such as Azadirachta indica (neem) and Bauhinia purpurea (orchid tree) also play a significant role in reducing pollutant levels in various locations.
Urban vegetation and tree cover are essential in mitigating the effects of summer heatwaves, soil contamination, air and water pollution, and noise. Air pollutants can cause visible damage to leaves, disrupt physiological processes like photosynthesis and carbon sequestration, and reduce the growth and vitality of plants, making them more susceptible to abiotic and biotic stress.
For this study, samples were collected from three locations in the city: Dulapally, the Bollaram Industrial Development Area (IDA), and Tukkuguda along the Medchal National Highway (NH44). These areas are home to various pharmaceutical, concrete, and beverage industries, hence heavily impacted by industrial emissions and vehicular pollution, which likely contribute to higher pollutant levels.

Bharati Patel, scientist-C (forest ecology & climate change) at the Institute of Forest Biodiversity, noted that the analysis of biochemical parameters in five species revealed that Azadirachta indica, Bauhinia purpurea, and Ficus benghalensis are well-suited for avenue plantations in industrial areas and along national highways to mitigate pollution from industrial effluents and vehicle emissions.
""These species can be effectively used for green belt development in industrial areas and along NH-44 to combat air pollution,"" said Bharati. ""Incorporating these plants into green belt designs will contribute to long-term air pollution management in industrial zones and along major highways."""

If all cars and commercial vehicles in the city are converted to electric vehicles, emissions will reduce by nearly a quarter, the study said.
Contrary to the belief that the real estate sector contributes the highest percentage of dust, the NIAS research revealed that the transport industry contributes to 39.1% — the highest — of the annual emissions of PM 2.5, followed by the industrial sector (24.2%) and road dust (13.7%). Similarly, road dust (34.3%) contributes in a big way to PM 10 emission, followed by the transport (23.7%) and industrial sectors (17.3%).
Dr Gufran Beig, chair professor, NIAS, revealed that the overwhelming presence of two-wheelers in Bengaluru is a major factor in transport-related emissions. ""The relatively low number of buses suggests a potential need for strengthening public transportation to reduce Bengaluru's reliance on private vehicles. Besides, the city also has a higher percentage of older cars compared to a relatively younger fleet of two-wheelers and three-wheelers, contributing considerably to these pollutants in the regular air,"" he said.
Referring to the ongoing debate on these pollutants, Dr Beig pointed out that everyone has failed to understand the dimensions of pollutants. ""Whenever we talk about these pollutants, we only talk about their size; nobody talks about the toxicity of these particles. A smaller toxic particle of PM 2.5 or PM 10 can also cause as much harm as a large quantity of these particulate matter. Most of these toxic particles are exhausted after burning fossil fuels such as petrol and diesel. Switching to EV is the solution,"" he said.

Given the worsening air quality of Bengaluru, the researchers tried addressing the situation by replacing conservative vehicles with EVs for estimating reduction in annual emissions. ""Despite the large volume of cars on city roads, converting all of them into EVs would only reduce emissions by 7.6%. But the fact lies in commercial vehicles and buses. If all of them were to be converted into EVs, it would bring down emissions by a whopping 21.8% and reduce the per capita healthcare cost in the city,"" Dr Beig explained.
Asked about the reluctance among motorists to switch to EVs, he said, ""Any innovation comes with its own set of challenges. We all need to work towards addressing those challenges rather than retreating. I agree that transition to EVs is plagued by problems, including insufficient infrastructure, lack of framework for safe disposal of batteries, and sustained durability of charge. But given our expertise in various fields, these can be resolved. Also, nothing is as important as our health. If these transitions are going to benefit our health in the long run, it's time we initiated the change.
Could have healthcare implications too
The per capita healthcare spending of the average Bengalurean increased by a staggering Rs 3,310 in 2023 alone, according to the NIAS study. It also revealed that Bengalureans suffered crores of rupees in losses in the form of premature deaths, morbid conditions, and prolonged ailments.
But can this be reversed? Experts, led by Dr Gufran Beig, revealed that a planned transition from diesel and petrol vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs) would considerably bring down healthcare expenses of Bengaluru, which are largely rising thanks to air pollution.
""If all vehicles, especially light commercial vehicles and buses, switch over to EVs, the per capita healthcare cost is likely to come down by at least Rs 2,008.4 a year,"" explained Dr Beig, while taking into consideration the cost of hospital admission, consultation, procedures, tests, and pharmacy expenses."

Dikshit, who is contesting from the New Delhi constituency against former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, listed various achievements of the earlier Congress govt under Sheila Dikshit in transport, infrastructure, and sewage management.
The Congress functionary is the son of the late Delhi chief minister, Sheila Dikshit.
""The DTC fleet has shrunk from around 5,500 buses during Congress govt to just around 3,000 buses now as Kejriwal has taken no step to enhance the DTC fleet in the past 10 years. Due to corruption in the maintenance of DTC buses, breakdowns have become a regular feature,"" he said.

He added that it was the responsibility of Delhi govt to clean up the air without giving excuses, ""though Kejriwal has only excuses to offer.""
The Congress candidate said that the setting up of more gas-based power plants was first started by the previous Congress govt in Bawana, which was another step taken to combat air pollution.
""Just by blaming Haryana and UP and stubble burning, Kejriwal has been trying to cover up his incompetence and inaction through tutored data and blatant lies. Stubble burning existed for decades, but the main cause for Delhi's air pollution was a sharp spike in vehicles on the roads in the absence of a robust public transport system and severe erosion of the green cover,"" Dikshit said.
Talking about the constituency, Dikshit said: ""People in the New Delhi constituency are very dissatisfied. I have been campaigning on the ground, and there is hardly any work done by Kejriwal, besides a few benches and dysfunctional CCTV cameras. Everyone is complaining about the poor quality of water, even in areas like NDMC, where it is hard to imagine problems of such basic facilities.""
Congress officials added that in the past few years, no new sewage treatment plant has been constructed by AAP govt. ""It was only by 2021-22, after the intervention of the courts, that three new STPs are being constructed, according to a DJB report submitted to the LG. Accumulated losses of DJB are at Rs 76,000 crore due to corruption and mismanagement by the Kejriwal govt,"" Dikshit said.
The Congress contestant from New Delhi said that his party has a plan to clean up the Yamuna and reduce air pollution.
""During Congress govt, several big flyovers were planned and constructed. We looked at road widening and traffic jam patterns and then, in a planned manner, rolled out projects. The blueprint will be applied in Delhi.""
AAP is yet to respond to Dikshit's allegations."

For the study, samples were collected from public places like bus stands, shops and buildings that had not cleared cobwebs for a long time. Researchers decided to study spider webs due to their ability to trap pollutants passively.
""Spider webs possess the remarkable ability to capture and accumulate a range of airborne pollutants, including particulate matter (PM), heavy metals and even microplastics. Their sticky and durable nature allows webs to passively trap pollutants for extended periods, acting as a natural filter for environmental contaminants,"" said senior scientist at Centre for Arachnology Research, Bharata Mata College, Mathew M Joseph, who conducted the study with his student Archana Anil of Sacred Heart College.
They presented the study findings at the eighth conference of Asian Society of Arachnology, held in Wuhan, China, recently.

Patna: The ambient air in Buxar with an air quality index (AQI) of 293, categorised as ""poor"", remained worse than Delhi for the third consecutive day on Saturday. Delhi's AQI was recorded at 255 on Saturday, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). However, only six other cities in the state, including Patna, experienced poor air quality during this period.
Other cities with poor air quality on the day included Patna (238), Hajipur (226), Araria (222), Begusarai (217), Muzaffarpur (204) and Aurangabad (202). The AQI for five other places — Bettiah, Darbhanga, Kishanganj, Motihari, and Rajgir — could not be calculated due to insufficient data, as per CPCB.
The AQI measures air quality, reflecting pollutants like particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10) that pose health risks. Health experts have long warned against prolonged exposure, saying that higher AQI levels can worsen conditions for asthma patients and those with respiratory problems, leading to pulmonary issues and, in extreme cases, lung cancer.
According to the CPCB website, air in the ""poor"" range (201-300) can cause breathing discomfort on long-term exposure. AQI in the ""very poor"" range (301-400) can lead to respiratory illnesses while prolonged exposure to ""severe"" air (401-500) may damage even healthy individuals and severely impact those with existing diseases or comorbidities."

Just 48 hours before the annual mega running event, a survey conducted by an environmental group on Friday morning found pollution levels along the route very high and breaching safety limits.
Thanks to the smoggy conditions prevailing due to the winter chill brought in by northerly winds, the speed of the sea breeze, which otherwise drives away the smog, was reduced.
On Friday, between 5am and 8.27am, volunteers of Awaaz Foundation used a sensor-based monitor to record PM2.5 particulate matter to check pollution levels at eight spots along the marathon route. None of the locations had particulate matter levels within limits considered ‘safe' by the authorities, Awaaz Foundation claimed. The routes of both the full (42.19km) and half (21.09km) marathons cover the stretch between the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus in south Mumbai and Bandra in the western suburbs.
In a letter to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and BMC, Awaaz Foundation's convenor Sumaira Abdulali said the highest pollution level of 154 micrograms per cubic metre was found at Mahim Reti Bunder, not far from the starting point of the half marathon in which 15,000 runners would be participating on Sunday. The lowest level of 95 micrograms per cubic metre was found at Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan Road in central Mumbai, the letter said, adding that as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) norms, the safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 micrograms for 24 hours.

The panel decided to revoke stage 4 curbs on Thursday amid a dip in pollution levels following a spell of rain in the region.
On Friday, air pollution level declined further amid strong winds, leading to revocation of stage 3 curbs.
GRAP Stage 3 entails a ban on non-essential construction work.

Classes up to grade 5 are required to shift to hybrid mode under Stage 3. Parents and students have the option to choose online education wherever available.
Under Stage 3, the use of BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel cars (4-wheelers) is restricted in Delhi and nearby NCR districts. Persons with disabilities are exempt. Stage 3 also bans non-essential diesel-operated medium goods vehicles with BS-IV or older standards in Delhi.
During winters, the Delhi-NCR region enforces restrictions under GRAP, which categorizes air quality into four stages - Stage 1 (Poor, AQI 201-300), Stage 2 (Very Poor, AQI 301-400), Stage 3 (Severe, AQI 401-450), and Stage 4 (Severe Plus, AQI above 450).
Unfavourable meteorological conditions, combined with vehicle emissions, paddy-straw burning, firecrackers, and other local pollution sources, lead to hazardous air quality levels in Delhi-NCR during winters."

In the current day we wake up to our air purifiers, smartphones warning us that the air quality is in the ‘very poor’ or ‘hazardous’ category. Whether schools, offices and going out will be physical or online, it all now depends on the quality of the air on a given day. The Air Quality Index, always fluctuating between 300-600, wasn’t a common phenomenon 30 years back. Even the discussion around air or air quality wasn’t a household thing.
While Delhi’s air quality is the biggest issue we discuss in our day-to-day lives now – online classes, working from home on account of pollution, people gifting air purifiers to each other on Diwali, kids taking inhalers to schools wasn’t something people in the ’90s thought of.
“Children in the late 90s didn’t know the word air pollution. but today as September ends, kids start asking, ‘Isn’t this the time when schools will be closing because of air pollution?’” says Dr Arvind

‘Nebulisers, air purifiers and masks in day-to-day use, were nonexistent 30 years ago’

Dr Arvind Kumar, Chairman, Lung Transplant, Medanta, Gurugram, moved to Delhi in 1976. The 66-year-old says that until 2004-2006, nobody spoke about air quality. “The term AQI
came into our lives in 2014. Nobody in Delhi was talking about air or air quality 30 years back. It wasn’t the best back then, but it wasn’t the way it is today either. Things like nebulisers, air purifiers and masks in day-to-day use, were nonexistent. When my children were growing up in Delhi in 2000, on the AIIMS campus, we needed nebulisers. That was a subtle change. But masks and air purifiers are all a post 2014-2015 phenomenon. The routine monitoring of air started around 1995. The forecasting and reporting on air quality started around 2014 and now we have real-time information on our air purifiers and AQI,” shares the doctor.
""The biggest change that we have seen in our practice of respiratory medicine is the awareness about lung diseases that pollution can cause, and nowadays we see
many patients walking to us in the OPD and enquiring about their lung health and the adverse effect pollution is causing,” says Dr Puneet Khanna, HOD and Consultant, Pulmonology, HCMCT Manipal Hospitals, Dwarka.
This is what we are breathing currently

‘Anyone who breathes - a newborn or an elderly - smokes 15-20 cigarettes in Oct-Nov in Delhi’
“As per a formula 22 microgram of PM2.5 is equal to 1 cigarette. So, when the PM2.5 level is at 400, mostly in Oct-Nov these days, it is equivalent to smoke of 15-20 cigarettes a day. I say that during Oct-Nov when PM2.5 is at 350-400, it is like smoking that number of cigarettes by anyone who breathes. That includes newborns to elderly. When I operate on teenagers, I see black deposits in their lungs, too, which was unheard of 30 years back,” says Dr Arvind Kumar.
Air quality in ’97
A 1997 white paper published by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) listed the annual averages of total
suspended PM (TSP) values as 373, 338, 317, 377, 372, 377, 407, 387, and 370 μg/ m3 for the period of 1989 to 1997 (9 years), based on data collected by manual stations

‘The 90s saw a less crowded, greener Delhi, with fewer vehicles, and sparrows in its parks’
The 1990s saw a less crowded, greener Delhi, with fewer vehicles, minimal construction, and an abundance of sparrows in its parks. Still, the city’s skyline was dominated by the smokeemitting chimneys of the Indraprastha and Rajghat power stations, along with a Badarpur Power station on the capital’s outskirts. The air was thick with soot, and vehicles belched black smoke as a common sight. Riding a scooter for a few kilometres left burning red eyes and a black layer of soot on white shirts. 30 years ago, Delhi took its first significant step to combat air pollution by adopting CNG
– Mohan George, Consultant, Clean Air & Sustainable Mobility, Center for Science and Environment (and Ex. Additional Director at Delhi Pollution Control Committee)
Switching to CNG was a significant step in mitigating air pollution in the 90s
Air quality might once have been an unfamiliar term, but the choking haze of pollution was an undeniable reality even in the mid-90s. Anumita Roychowdhury, Executive Director for Research and Advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, shares, ""When our Right to Clean Air Campaign was initiated in 1996, Delhi’s choking haze of pollution was visibly black. But there was barely any data to piece together the pollution jigsaw and to see through the smokescreen. Authorities could easily dismiss the problem of particulate matter as ‘natural dust’. We used photos of black human lungs as warheads to provoke a response. Despite these odds, we have seen massive energy changeover, with public and commercial transport moving from diesel to CNG and industrial areas switching from coal, pet coke and furnace oil to natural gas in Delhi. These were tough battles."" She adds, ""I still recall the April 5, 2002 directive of the Supreme Court, upholding the Right to Life, that declined to dilute the 1998 CNG order and imposed a penalty for non-compliance. Delhi’s first action phase was driven by desperation and the urgency for immediate relief. Yet despite the initial gains, air quality is far from the clean benchmark.""
""Even after switching to CNG it feels like we keep returning to square one when it comes to pollution. My daughter was born in ’95 and my son was born in ’97. Even in the ’90s, the air was bad enough for the doctor to warn me, during both pregnancies, that my placenta resembled that of a heavy smoker, due to pollution. She advised me to stay indoors,"" adds Swapna Liddle, historian and author."

Chandigarh: Amid escalating concerns over air pollution, the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) has issued a formal notice to the MC commissioner due to ongoing instances of waste burning throughout the city, despite previous warnings.
The CPCC has issued strict instructions to the civic body, demanding immediate action to prevent waste burning across Chandigarh and enforce penalties against violators. The notice said, ""Despite notices by CPCC and instructions of the chief secretary during the review meeting of NGT matter 606/2018 that nowhere in Chandigarh should waste be burnt and strict action should be taken against defaulters, waste is still being burnt in various places in Chandigarh, more specifically in Sector 53, where it is regularly noticed that waste is being burnt on an almost daily basis.""
The situation worsened when the MC was found disposing of unprocessed solid waste in vacant areas in Sector 53. Following TOI's coverage and UT chief secretary's intervention, senior MC officials acted to stop the dumping, yet the burning of existing waste continued.
The notice additionally said, ""Waste is being burnt at the backside of the Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring station, Sector 53, in an open field, creating a very bad impact on air quality."" The CPCC had previously advised the MC to address this issue in October 2024.

The waste burning significantly affects the city's air quality. The CPCC noted that winter conditions have already compromised air quality, necessitating the Graded Action Response Plan. The committee emphasised that waste burning further deteriorates air quality, endangering residents' health.
Should the MC fail to address these violations following the CPCC notice and administration directives, the committee may implement environmental compensation penalties against the corporation."

The drizzle brought much-needed relief from the pollution levels that saw a steep surge on Wednesday when the AQI was recorded at a 'poor' reading of 270, a jump of over 100 points from Tuesday's 156.
The relief, however, is temporary, warned experts. According to forecasts, unfavourable meteorological conditions for the dispersion of pollutants may push the AQI into the 'poor' or 'very poor' category in the coming days.
Stages III and IV of GRAP were invoked on Wednesday after a spike in AQI. GRAP-IV, however, was revoked across NCR on Thursday due to better air conditions. Restrictions under stages I, II, and III, will continue to remain in force.
Among the city's monitoring stations, Gwalpahari saw the worst AQI with a 'poor' reading of 225. Vikas Sadan and Sector 51 recorded 117 and 146, respectively -- both 'moderate'. This data was unavailable at the Teri Gram monitoring station.

According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the ventilation index (measure of the atmosphere's ability to disperse pollutants) is lower than the required 6000 m²/s. The average wind speed, less than 10 km/h, adds to poor pollutant dispersion.
""The predominant surface wind is likely to flow from the north with a speed of less than 4kmph during morning hours. Smog or moderate fog in most places and dense fog in isolated areas is likely in the morning. The wind speed may reach 8-10kmph from the northwest during the afternoon, but it will decrease and go below 6kmph during the evening and night,"" Safar stated.
The particulate matter levels remain highly concerning. Sector 51 recorded a PM2.5 level of 326 µg/m³, nearly 21 times higher than the World Health Organization's (WHO) safe limit of 15 µg/m³. It was followed by Gwalpahari (321 µg/m³) and Vikas Sadan at 253 µg/m³.
PM10 levels were also the worst at Gwalpahari at 177 µg/m³ — nearly four times WHO's safe threshold of 45 µg/m³. Sector 51 measured 169 µg/m³ and Vikas Sadan 144 µg/m³. Both the PM2.5 and PM10 were not recorded at Teri Gram.
The Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) annual safe limit is 60 µg/m³ for PM2.5 and 100 µg/m³ for PM10.
""Keeping in view its disruptive nature impacting a large number of stakeholders and public at large and with significant improvement in the average AQI also considering abrupt fluctuations in the meteorological factors, the GRAP sub-committee however decides to revoke Stage-IV of extant GRAP schedule in the entire NCR at this stage, with immediate effect,"" the CAQM order read."

Overcast skies pull max temp down sharply
Fog is expected to continue in the region, with the met department issuing a ‘yellow’ (be aware) alert for Thursday to Saturday for moderate to dense fog. Some areas received light rain in the evening.
R K Jenamani, senior IMD scientist, said visibility was in the range of 100-150 metres (dense fog) since 5.30am on Wednesday. “Dense fog intensified late morning on Wednesday with general visibility reducing to zero from 8.30am at both Safdarjung and IGI Airport. visibility dropped due to calm wind conditions and a stable surface atmospheric boundary layer. Easterly winds brought moisture which intensified the foggy conditions. Zero visibility with very dense fog conditions persisted at both Safdarjung and IGI Airport till 11.30 am,” said Jenamani.
This was the first time this season that dense fog had extended beyond 9.30am in the city, he said. By 12.30pm, visibility improved to 250-400 metres. Because of its persistence till late morning, Wednesday’s fog spell had a major impact on road, rail and air traffic. However, the most intense dense fog in terms of duration this season was recorded on Jan 4-5, which lasted for nearly nine hours from 11.30pm to 8.30am, according to IMD’s data.
Overcast skies during the day brought down the maximum temperature from 21.2 degrees Celsius on Tuesday to 18.1 degrees C, two notches below normal. The minimum temperature dipped to six degrees C, one degree below normal, compared to 8.9 degrees C a day earlier. Met department’s data shows that Palam, Pusa and Najafgarh recorded 0.5 mm rainfall each from 5.30pm to 8.30pm.
“There are chances of very light rain on Wednesday night and Thursday morning under the influence of a western disturbance. Another spell of very light to light rain is expected on Jan 21 night,” said a Met official. The fog spell is likely to continue."

The senior IAS officer, who is ACS transport, referred to a video conference of Jan 4 under the chairmanship of the PM's advisor, Tarun Kapoor, in which the chairman of Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) made a presentation on the subject.
The presentation was based on a Jan 2023 report by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), which said agricultural residue burning contributes 1% to PM 2.5 and PM10 levels in Delhi. This finding was displayed in a slide labeled ‘Sectoral Contribution of Sources of NCR to Particulate Matter'. Khemka's note, titled ‘Management of Air Pollution in NCR', was sent on Jan 10. According to the TERI report Khemka referred to, road dust contributes 42% to PM10 levels in Delhi annually while transport contributes 25%. Transport accounts for 47% of PM 2.5 emissions and road dust 20%. There is a higher contribution of dust sources to PM10 in summer (38-42%) compared to winter (23-31%). It's the same for PM 2.5 (31-34% in summer to 15% in winter).

However, while the ACS stresses the importance of having a strategy to contain vehicular pollution, farm fire emissions cannot be compared to vehicular or any other pollution source that is an all-year phenomenon.
Farm fires are seasonal, happening within a window between Sept 1 and Nov 30. So, their share in an annual metric will always be small. Besides, during the peak season for farm fires, their share in the capital's pollution levels are much, much higher than 1%.
According to the Decision Support System (DSS) for air quality management in Delhi, which has been used to monitor the contribution of farm fires to the capital's PM 2.5 levels, stubble burning's contribution touched 35% on Nov 1 last year.
Every winter, air quality in Delhi-NCR plummets to hazardous levels as the airshed fills up with toxic haze which is triggered by a combination of pollutants, fog, lack of winds and other meteorological factors. Farm fires, commonly seen in north India's agricultural belt to clear tracts of land for another round of sowing after the paddy harvest, become a major compounding factor when added to local sources.
Shubhansh Tiwari, research associate at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), told TOI: ""Agricultural residue burning's overall contribution is small compared to other sources as it occurs for a limited period. The issue needs to be addressed because, during the 45 days when farmers clear their fields, meteorological conditions carry the smoke into NCR. Nevertheless, road dust and vehicular emissions remain primary contributors to particulate matter in Delhi-NCR and effective management of these sources, especially during the summer months when dust levels are higher, is crucial for improving air quality. So what we need is a holistic approach that addresses all significant pollution sources."""

Kolkata: The city experienced significant fluctuations in its air quality index (AQI) on Monday, with some monitoring stations recovering through the day from the bad air conditions on Sunday. The Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) air quality station on B T Road emerged as the city's most polluted zone, recording AQI levels that consistently fell within the ‘poor' category (AQI: 201-300). In contrast, Rabindra Sarobar and Victoria Memorial Hall stations showed improvement as the day progressed.
The RBU station, which has historically maintained the best air quality in the city, recorded a steep rise in pollution levels, peaking at 275 AQI by 7 pm. This marks a significant departure from its usual status, as it managed to maintain ‘moderate' air quality (AQI: 101-200) even when other stations plunged into the poor range earlier this year.
Jadavpur, which recorded poor air quality on Sunday, showed notable recovery to the ‘moderate' category on Monday. The AQI at Jadavpur started at 189 in the morning, dipped to 174 by midday, and rose slightly to 191 by evening.
In south Kolkata, Ballygunge's air quality worsened steadily over the day. It began with an AQI of 261 at 5 am and peaked at 263 by 7 pm, marking it as one of the most polluted zones. However, nearby Rabindra Sarobar saw its AQI improve from 174 in the morning to 153 by evening, maintaining moderate air quality. Victoria Memorial Hall recorded a decline in AQI from 272 at 5 am to 217 by 7 pm, indicating marginal improvement, though it was still within the poor range.

The civic body initially planned to install the sensors in association with IIT-Kanpur and then, considering logistical issues, pursued a tie-up with IIT-Bombay. However, with a delayed response from IIT-Bombay, the BMC sought a fresh proposal from IIT-Kanpur.
A fresh proposal was given by IIT-Kanpur Professor Sachchida Nand Tripathi, a professor of civil engineering and sustainable energy engineering, and his team, which includes start-ups. ""We are examining the proposal,"" said a civic official. ""The elements of the fresh proposal are not significantly different from the earlier one,"" said an official. The installation of the hyperlocal air quality monitoring units is expected to cost around Rs 13 crore.
""The earlier plan was to install 250 sensors across the city. However, the BMC now intends to install about 75 sensors, and the city will be divided into equal-sized grids of about eight square kilometres. The sensor-based air quality monitoring units would be set up at each of these grids. The monitoring units are expected to help BMC in measuring air quality at granular hyperlocal levels,"" said an official.

Between 2008 and 2020, Hyderabad recorded an annual average of 5,552 deaths linked to air pollution, with 1,597 fatalities reported in 2023 alone, making it the sixth deadliest city in India for pollution-related deaths. Vulnerable groups, especially children with developing lungs, are at heightened risk.
Environmental experts point to temperature inversion as a key factor exacerbating winter air pollution. Padmaja K, a pollution researcher in Hyderabad, said, ""During the night, the ground cools rapidly, trapping cooler air beneath a warmer layer and preventing pollutants from dispersing. Weak winter winds further slow the process, allowing pollutants to accumulate.""
Experts underscore the urgent need for strengthening public transport, promoting cycling and walking, phasing out old vehicles, and cracking down on adulterated fuels are seen as critical steps. Improved traffic management, stricter monitoring of industrial emissions, and regulation of construction activities are also essential, experts pointed out.
""Simple measures, like installing curtains around construction sites and sprinkling water to reduce dust, can make a big difference,"" said environmentalist Bhaskar Reddy. He added, ""We can't eliminate pollution entirely, but controlling it is within our reach. Enforcing existing laws and penalising violators are crucial to curb pollution and slow climate change."""

While its impacts on respiratory and cardiovascular health are well-documented, its effects on vision and eye health are often overlooked. With cities like Delhi facing hazardous air quality levels year-round, it is essential to understand how polluted air affects the eyes in both the short and long term.
Immediate effects of air pollution on vision
Air pollution can cause a range of immediate discomforts and symptoms in the eyes. Redness, irritation, and a burning sensation are among the most common complaints. These issues arise because pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and toxic gases like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide come into direct contact with the eye's surface.
Dry eye syndrome, a condition where the eyes fail to produce sufficient tears or the tears evaporate too quickly, is also closely linked to air pollution. Pollutants disrupt the tear film, the natural protective layer of the eye, leaving the eyes feeling gritty, itchy, and prone to infections. Additionally, many individuals experience allergic reactions, such as conjunctivitis, which causes swelling, itching, and watery discharge.

Long-term impact on eye health
While immediate discomfort is alarming, the long-term consequences of air pollution on vision are even more concerning. Chronic exposure to polluted air has been associated with several serious eye conditions:
1. Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
AMD is a leading cause of vision loss among individuals over the age of 50. Research shows that fine particulate matter, particularly PM2.5, can accelerate the onset of AMD by causing oxidative stress and inflammation in the retina. People living in urban areas with poor air quality are at a significantly higher risk.

2. Cataracts
Cataracts, a condition where the natural lens of the eye becomes cloudy, impairing vision, have also been linked to air pollution. Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, combined with pollutants, accelerates the development of cataracts. This issue is especially prevalent in countries like India, where outdoor workers are disproportionately exposed to both pollution and sunlight.
3. Glaucoma
Emerging research suggests that pollution may contribute to glaucoma, a group of conditions that damage the optic nerve and can lead to permanent blindness. High levels of air pollution are believed to elevate intraocular pressure, one of the main risk factors for glaucoma, further underscoring the need for vigilance.
Delhi’s air pollution crisis
Delhi, infamous for its hazardous air quality, provides a case study on how pollution impacts vision. In November 2024, the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) hit 484—classified as ""severe plus."" During such episodes, hospitals and clinics report a sharp rise in cases of eye irritation, dry eye syndrome, and allergic conjunctivitis. The dense smog not only obscures visibility but also worsens eye conditions, particularly for individuals with pre-existing sensitivities.
How to protect your eyes from air pollution
Protecting your eyes amidst rising pollution levels requires adopting preventive measures:
1. Wear protective eyewear: Sunglasses or goggles act as a barrier against pollutants and UV radiation.
2. Practice eye hygiene: Regularly rinsing your eyes with clean water helps remove irritants and reduce discomfort.
3. Use artificial tears: Over-the-counter lubricating eye drops can help maintain moisture in your eyes and prevent dryness.
4. Limit outdoor activities: Avoid venturing outdoors during peak pollution hours, typically early morning and late evening.
5. Maintain indoor air quality: Using air purifiers at home can reduce exposure to indoor air pollutants.
Government and community efforts to mitigate pollution
Authorities have taken steps to combat the alarming levels of pollution. Measures like halting construction activities, restricting the use of older diesel vehicles, and closing schools during severe pollution days aim to reduce exposure. However, long-term solutions require a collective effort. Public awareness campaigns, stricter emission controls, and green urban initiatives, such as tree planting, are essential.
Why vision protection matters
The eyes are among the most sensitive organs in the body, and their health can deteriorate rapidly under adverse conditions. Protecting your vision is not just about addressing immediate discomfort but also about preventing long-term damage. With pollution levels showing no signs of abating, individual efforts to protect eye health must go hand in hand with systemic reforms to improve air quality.
Air pollution’s effects on vision are both immediate and long-lasting. From minor irritation to irreversible conditions like AMD and glaucoma, the risks are significant. While individual precautions can alleviate short-term symptoms, a sustainable solution to the pollution crisis is essential to safeguard public health. As the nation continues to urbanize, addressing air pollution must remain a top priority to ensure a healthier future for generations to come.

What does the study say?

Researchers from University College London (UCL) analyzed health records of 3,600 airport neighbors and 21,300 people who don’t live near a flight path to examine the effects of substantial and moderate aircraft commotion compared to no noise.
The residents exposed to worse racket, especially at night, had stiffer and thicker heart muscles that doubled or quadrupled their risk of a heart attack, life-threatening heart rhythm or stroke, the researchers said.
Senior study author and cardiologist Dr. Gaby Captur, said, “Our study is observational so we cannot say with certainty that high levels of aircraft noise caused these differences in heart structure and function.”
He added, “However, our findings add to a growing body of evidence that aircraft noise can adversely affect heart health and our health more generally.”
Higher noise was defined as exceeding an average of 50 decibels during the day and 45 decibels between 11 pm and 7 am. Fifty decibels is generally considered to be the equivalent of a humming refrigerator.
The World Health Organization recommends limiting daytime aircraft noise to 45 decibels and nighttime noise to 40 decibels to avoid negative health effects. Compared to road or rail noise, planes tend to be louder and more unpredictable. So, according to the UCL researchers, it’s difficult to get used to them.

Past research has linked constant plane noise to sleep disturbances, increased stress, impaired cognition in children, weight gain and a higher risk of high blood pressure and heart disease. The UCL researchers attributed much of the changes in heart structure and function to obesity and high blood pressure (specifically for those exposed to daytime noise). Among the study participants, 8% lived in an area with high daytime noise and 3% with high nighttime noise. Moving away from the airport helped improve health.
Living near an airport can be hazardous to your health and safety. The risks increase with how close you live to the airport and how often you're exposed to aircraft noise and emissions.
Health risks are:

Air pollution: Aircraft emissions can expose you to high levels of ultrafine particles (UFPs) that can damage your lungs and breathing passages. UFPs can also worsen asthma symptoms and impair cognitive ability in children.
Noise pollution: The constant noise from aircraft taking off and landing can disrupt your sleep and quality of life.
Cardiovascular disease: Exposure to aircraft noise and emissions can increase your risk of heart disease and hypertension.
Respiratory issues: People with pre-existing conditions like asthma may experience more frequent and severe respiratory symptoms.
Mental health problems: The stress and sleep disturbances caused by aircraft noise can contribute to anxiety and depression.
Safety concerns are:
Traffic congestion: Airports can generate significant traffic congestion in the surrounding areas, which can lead to longer commute times.
Aircraft emergencies: In the event of an aircraft emergency, properties near the airport may be at a higher risk.

What’s the safe distance?

A study supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in collaboration with the University of California and Columbia University found that people who lived within six miles of 12 of California's largest airports exhibited higher levels of asthma and heart-related problems.
The ideal distance to live from an airport depends on your preferences and how much noise and pollution you're willing to tolerate.
Noise pollution
Distance from flight paths: Properties closer to flight paths will experience more noise.
Elevation: Properties at higher elevations may experience less noise.
Orientation: Properties with windows and outdoor spaces facing away from the airport may be quieter.
Air pollution
Ultrafine particles: Airport exhaust contains ultrafine particles that can be inhaled or swallowed and can worsen asthma symptoms.
Air quality: Heavy airplane traffic can pollute the air up to 10 miles away.

This was a slight improvement from the previous day's air quality index (AQI) of 236.
Of the three monitoring stations, two — Teri Gram and Vikas Sadan — recorded AQI levels in the poor category with readings of 272 and 203, respectively. However, the AQI in Sector 51 was slightly better, classified as ‘moderate', with a reading of 186. The AQI at Gwalpahari could not be recorded due to insufficient data.
Experts predicted that the AQI was likely to remain in the ‘poor' to ‘very poor' category over the next six days, primarily due to the unfavourable dispersion of pollutants.
According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the ventilation index, which measures the atmosphere's ability to disperse pollutants, is lower than the required 6,000m²/s. The average wind speed, which is less than 10kmph, added to poor pollutant dispersion.

The capital's AQI rose to 393 in the higher end of the ‘very poor' category on Thursday, as opposed to as opposed to 297 in the poor range a day earlier.
In Noida, air quality dipped to ‘poor' at 259 from 161 in the ‘moderate' category the day before. Greater Noida also witnessed a similar dip to ‘poor' from ‘moderate' with an AQI of 270, against 177 on Wednesday. Neighbouring Ghaziabad saw the most drastic deterioration in air quality of the three, with AQI slipping to the ‘very poor' category at 332 from 198 the day before.
As Delhi-NCR's air quality swiftly deteriorated on Thursday, it prompted the CAQM to impose restrictive measures under Stage III of GRAP to prevent further deterioration in air quality. This is the fourth time this winter that Stage III has been enforced in NCR.

No respite is expected in air quality in the next two days. ""Light winds have been blowing in the city since Wednesday night, leading to the accumulation of pollutants. Besides, the wind direction changed to easterly on Thursday and during the transition phase, the winds turned calm. Similar conditions are likely to persist over the next two days,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of Skymet Meteorology.
Palawat added that light rain was predicted for Saturday, which may improve the air quality.
Supreme Court has said Stage III GRAP should be imposed when the AQI crosses 350, as against the earlier threshold of 400. It similarly said that Stage IV should be imposed when the AQI touches 400. The earlier threshold was 450.
""The forecasts from IMD/IITM also suggest a likelihood of the average AQI of Delhi to particularly remain in this adverse range for a few days owing to unfavourable meteorological conditions,"" the CAQM said on Thursday.
CAQM's member secretary Arvind Nautiyal issued a letter on Thursday asking NCR cities to develop a suitable urban area-specific annual action plan for 2025-26 and submit the details to the commission by Feb 28, 2025.
""Road dust is a significant source contributing to the generation and release of particulate matter, posing a major challenge in tackling and abating air pollution in NCR. The strategy to address this problem has to be diverse and not limited to only road cleaning and sweeping, as a lot of this problem is caused due to unscientific construction and management of urban roads. Considering the significant contribution of road dust re-suspension in the AQI of Delhi-NCR, a study titled ‘Addressing Vehicular Traffic Induced Road Dust Re-suspension with Science and Technology Based Action Plans for Air Quality Management in Delhi-NCR' was entrusted by the Commission upon CSIR-NEERI and CSIR-CRRI,"" Nautiyal said.
As part of Stage III, Delhi govt will impose strict restrictions on the plying of Delhi-registered, diesel-operated Medium Goods Vehicles (MGVs) of BS-IV standards and below, in Delhi. Besides, BS-IV and below diesel-operated Light Commercial Vehicles (goods carriers), registered outside Delhi, have been barred from entering the city. However, those vehicles carrying essential commodities or providing essential services are exempted.
Additionally, classes in schools for children up to Class V have to be held in ""hybrid"" mode, physical and online in Delhi, Gurgaon, Faridabad, Ghaziabad and GB Nagar. However, state govts may also consider conducting classes for students up to Class V in a ""hybrid"" mode in other areas in NCR."

Gurgaon and Faridabad were the most polluted, and Narnaul and Ambala the least in the group of 22, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). In Gurgaon, the study recorded average PM10 levels over 2024 at 186 µg/m³, more than three times the limit of 60 µg/m³ set by the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).
Faridabad, the only city in the state that has been tagged as ‘non-attainment' under the National Clean Air Programme, wasn't far behind, with an average of 171 µg/m³ PM10 levels. On 280 days of the year – 76.5% -- PM10 concentration in Faridabad exceeded the daily NAAQS limit.
Gurgaon's count was even higher, at 290 days.

PM10, or particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less, can penetrate deep into the respiratory system, causing or exacerbating breathing ailments and cardiovascular diseases. Prolonged exposure can also lead to chronic health conditions, especially among children, the elderly, or people with existing ailments.
The pollutant is released from industries, vehicles, waste burning and construction dust. ""It is alarming that all 22 cities that were monitored for PM10 were found to be breaching the national limit. Even after six years (of being part of NCAP), Faridabad has seen slight improvement in PM10 levels between 2019 and 2024,"" said Manoj Kumar, analyst at CREA.
NCAP, an initiative introduced in 2019, shortlisted 130 Indian cities where the air quality did not meet NAAQS limits from 2011 to 2015. Funds are provided to these ‘non-attainment' cities to achieve clean air targets.
Kumar said the govt should consider expanding the scope of NCAP. ""The current NCAP misses a critical health component and primarily focuses on PM10. NCAP 2.0 should address this gap by prioritising PM2.5, as it poses a greater threat to human health,"" he said.
Another poor performer in CREA's study was Ballabgarh, which recorded an annual PM10 average of 168 µg/m³ and saw 275 days when the concentration of the pollutant exceeded safe limits in 2024. Dharuhera's annual PM10 average was 154 µg/m³, Sonipat's was 126 µg/m³, Bhiwani's 121 µg/m³ and Kaithal's 119 µg/m³. Haryana govt officials on Wednesday acknowledged the severity of air pollution across the state.
""We have been taking several measures to address the issue. These include stricter enforcement of emission norms, promotion of cleaner technologies, and increasing green cover to mitigate the impact of air pollution. Every year we also carry out public awareness campaigns to educate citizens about the importance of reducing pollution at the individual level,"" said Vijay Chaudhry, regional officer of Gurgaon (south), Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB). Experts also pointed out that the state needed a multi-pronged approach to curb air pollution.
""This includes reducing vehicular emissions, controlling industrial pollution, and managing construction activities. Collaborative efforts from the govt, industries, and citizens are crucial to ensure cleaner air for all,"" said Shubhansh Tiwari, a research associate at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).
Dr R Subramanian, sector head for air quality at the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP), said that the study showed air pollution wasn't just an NCR problem.
""We see high levels of air pollution not just in Delhi-NCR, but all across the Indo-Gangetic plain, and even in cities across South India. For example, in Bengaluru, PM2.5 along roads can be three times the average PM2.5 across the city,"" he said."

The govt is focusing on developing projects to offset the fossil fuel demand.
""We are focusing on developing new forms of fuel like ethanol, methanol, bio-diesel, bio-CNG, and hydrogen-based fuel alternatives to overcome challenges posed by fossil fuel,"" Gadkari said, flagging off the BAJA SAEINDIA 2025 event and the country's first HCNG Baja buggies at the NATRAX testing facility. He said the ministry of highways contributes to 40% of the air pollution in India. Curbing imports of fossil fuel is a big challenge, he said, adding India imports fossil fuel to the tune of Rs22 lakh crore every year.
He said the focus is also on the diversification of agriculture to produce fuel and energy for different sectors, including construction. ""We will be extracting fuel from corn, broken rice, bamboo, rice straw, and B&C molasses,"" he said, adding the farmers will now not only be ‘annadata' but also givers of energy and fuel to the country.
He said companies like Tata, Mahindra & Mahindra, Toyota, Hyundai, and Suzuki are working on bringing out a flex engine running on bio-ethanol. Bajaj, TVS, and Hero Honda have already brought out two and three-wheelers on alternative fuel.The minister spoke about various projects involving hydrogen-based fuel and said, ""We will soon launch a project to mix CNG with hydrogen. This will be especially useful in reducing cost and pollution in construction equipment.""

It said on Thursday that Delhi was able to reduce PM10 by just 12% in 2024 from the base year level.

NCAP, which aims to improve air quality across Indian cities by reducing PM10 concentrations against the base year of 2017, completed five years since its launch. Launched in Jan 2019, NCAP had scheduled a 20-30% reduction in PM10 concentrations by 2023. This was later extended to 2026 with a revised target of a 40% reduction in PM10. At present, 130 non-attainment cities, which recorded high pollution levels, are covered by NCAP.
The analysis showed that Ghaziabad and Faridabad in the National Capital Region successfully achieved the initial target, with the two cities recording, respectively, a 39% and 25% reduction in PM10 against the 2017 levels. Noida's PM10 concentration came down by 19% in 2024.

Delhi was only able to reduce PM10 by 3% in 2024 against the figure in 2019. Gurgaon, Greater Noida and Faridabad saw reductions, respectively, of 2%, 3% and 11% in PM10 levels in 2024 compared with 2019, according to CREA.
As for PM2.5, the analysis showed that reduction under this category in Delhi was 3% in 2024 with respect to 2019. However, PM2.5 levels in neighbouring Gurgaon, Faridabad and Greater Noida were less by 3%, 11%, and 21%, respectively, in 2024 than in 2019.
Manoj Kumar, analyst, CREA, said, ""The current NCAP primarily focuses on PM10, but it should prioritise PM2.5 because the latter poses a greater threat to human health."" He added, ""Epidemiological studies have consistently shown that PM2.5 is linked to significantly higher increases in morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritise PM2.5 over PM10 in NCAP. Also, stricter emission standards must be enforced to address the rising fuel consumption across all sectors, with penalties for non-compliance and no extensions granted for delays in implementation.""
In terms of PM2.5, Delhi was the second most polluted city in the country in 2024, with an average PM2.5 concentration of 105 micrograms per cubic metre after Meghalaya's Byrnihat (126 micrograms per cubic metre). With regard to PM10, Delhi was the third most polluted city in 2024, with an average PM10 level of 211 micrograms per cubic metre, after Sri Ganga Nagar in Rajasthan (236 micrograms per cubic metre) and Greater Noida (226 micrograms per cubic metre).
Based on PM2.5, Delhi exceeded the daily national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) on 248 out of 366 days in 2024. Despite being only the second most polluted city, it saw the highest number of ‘severe' AQI days (21 days) compared with Byrnihat, which logged 10 such days, said the report, adding that Gurgaon had more exceedance days than Delhi, with 260 days above the NAAQS among the 366 monitored days.

To demonstrate the action it has taken, MPCB pointed to show-cause notices that have been issued to bakeries and bhattis that make pao which use wood as fuel, including the iconic Yazdani Bakery in south Mumbai, one of the oldest Irani eateries of the city.
In the notice sent two days prior, Yazdani Bakery was asked to explain why it should not be closed down for using wood as fuel without permission and operating the bakery unit without prior consent.
BMC, through senior counsel Milind Sathe, said bakeries across the city were being told to switch to cleaner fuel within a year. Mumbai is populated with pao makers and bhattis form part of the top three polluters, HC was told. These bhattis may face more heat, BMC and MPCB said.
""We are not comparing Delhi with Mumbai. Mumbai has a locational advantage while Delhi has a locational disadvantage,"" said Chief Justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya and Justice Girish Kulkarni, while expressing their serious concern at air pollution in the city in a suo motu PIL.

HC said despite its previous orders passed last March, much is left to be done with respect to compliance by the state and asked MPCB lawyer Jyoti Chavan what steps had been taken. She said 1,300-odd posts were sanctioned to ensure audits and monitoring, but only 35 posts were advertised for recruitment. The CJ responded incredulously: ""Only 35?"" Advocate general Birendra Saraf said the finance department's approval is also needed and will be taken. ""While much needs to be done, steps have been taken by the state, and it has helped reduce pollution in Mumbai,"" he said.
Senior counsel Darius Khambata, as amicus curiae (friend of the court), said BMC presents the city with a ""Hobson's choice"" (a situation in which there is no real choice at all) over steps to take against ongoing construction that causes immense pollution and questioned why BMC cannot enforce compliance of its norms on such projects.
Justice Kulkarni asked what could be done when the AQI suddenly deteriorates. Senior counsel Janak Dwarkadas for NGO Vanashakti cited how construction sites in Bangkok had a monitor displaying live levels of AQI and sound decibels. He said such devices are available in India and could be used by BMC at construction sites.

Over 200 diesel-powered machines were being operated in the area, with each burning approximately 120 litres of fuel daily, releasing thick exhaust that polluted the air and worsened health issues for residents already grappling with dust-laden surroundings. In fact, around 8 lakh litres of diesel was being consumed monthly during the mining season, as per local estimates.
""The demand for diesel skyrockets during mining months. It's a huge business driven by massive machines,"" said a local petrol pump owner.
The fuel consumption also came at a cost to the state, which earned only Rs 27 crore in revenue from soapstone mining last year, compared to Rs 51 crore spent on diesel in just eight months. Ramesh Krishak, a local activist, said, ""The govt talks about revenue, but what about the damage to the environment? Who will account for the poison these machines release into the air?

The respiratory system is by far the organ that suffers most from air pollution. Fine particulate matter permeates down into the spaces in the alveoli, where it results in inflammation, oxidative stress, and impaired function. Chronic exposure to pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide may result in asthma, bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), among other conditions. The risk for lung cancer is significantly increased with exposure to carcinogenic compounds, especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Along with that, airborne pollutants also hinder the ciliary movement of the respiratory tract, which compromises the body's natural defense against infections such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Broader Impacts on the Human Body
Sometimes the particulates may penetrate the blood and cause systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, which often leads to different types of cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, myocardial infarction, and strokes. Increased neurological effects have been evidenced by emerging studies linking air pollution and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's because of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Furthermore, exposure is related to less-than-happy fetal development and higher susceptibility as a result of compromised immunity.
To reduce health risks from air pollution, personal as well as collective actions should be taken. Individual actions comprise wearing masks and using air purifiers. Comprehensive actions include putting up stringent rules on emissions, adoption of renewable energy, and afforestation within the cities. This way healthcare professionals and policymakers can join in combating this silent epidemic for a brighter future.

""Despite improvements, high vehicle density contributes to nearly 40% of Delhi's annual PM2.5 emissions. Poor regulation of emissions from neighbouring industrial clusters and construction activities exacerbate air pollution. Stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana during winter months adds a critical external factor to the city's pollution burden,"" the report stated.
Citing seasonal variations causing pollution spikes, the report further stated that during winters, the smog episodes remained severe, with PM2.5 levels exceeding 250 µg/m³ due to low wind speeds, temperature inversions and stubble burning.
The study recommended key interventions, including enhanced public transportation networks, more effective dust management protocols and coordinated efforts across states to address agricultural waste burning practices. It stressed that achieving the NCAP's ambitious 40% reduction target by 2026 would require hyper-localised solutions alongside robust regional coordination.
The report highlighted the challenges of addressing emissions in a densely populated urban area.
""Delhi's slow progress reflects the need for deeper structural changes and sustained efforts to curb emissions. Seasonal spikes, industrial emissions, transboundary pollution, and high vehicular density are critical factors that demand targeted action,"" said Ronak Sutaria, founder of Respirer Living Sciences.

The analysis is significant as it confirms that dust and pollutants in the city's air exceed the level reached before the lockdowns in 2020 brought clear blue skies and clean air.
The findings indicate that spikes in industrial areas and the eastern suburbs have turned them into pollution hot spots. PM2.5 levels are exceeding 45 µg/m³ in winter in some places, according to the report by Respirer Living Sciences, an agency involved in monitoring air quality in real-time and suggesting solutions.
The report also raises concerns over poor wind dispersal due to the increase in high rises. Titled ""Toward Cleaner Skies: An In-Depth Analysis of Air Quality Improvements in Indian Cities (2019-2024)"", the study was released on Tuesday to mark the 6th anniversary of the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP).
The report said Mazgaon (57.1 µg/m³) is the most polluted area due to dense traffic and industrial and construction activities. Other places which showed higher levels of PM2.5 are Worli, Malad West, Andheri-Chakala, BKC, Shivajinagar Mankhurd, Deonar, and Chembur.

Conversely, Borivali East (20.4 µg/m³) reported the cleanest air, benefiting from better green cover and lower vehicular density. Other such places which showed lesser toxicity are T2 airport, Powai, Vile Parle, Mulund, and Vasai.
The report, which used data from the AtlasAQ Platform, says the city recorded annual average PM2.5 level of 36.1 µg/m³ in 2024, marking a 2.6% increase since 2019 (35.2 µg/m³). While Mumbai's pollution levels remain significantly lower than in Delhi (107 µg/m³), the surge in PM2.5 underscores the need for targeted measures, it added. The spike in PM2.5 places the city in the ‘moderate' or ‘non-satisfactory' pollution category.
On the positive side, the report said the city experienced improvement in number of ‘good air' days, from 164 in 2021 to 184 in 2024. ""The heatmap of the city suggested that PM2.5 levels remained relatively low in monsoon but showed a consistent rise in November, showing the city's struggle with winter air stagnation and construction-related dust,"" it said.
""In western suburbs, construction activity and vehicular congestion appear to have contributed to periodic spikes, particularly during peak hours. Similarly, in the eastern suburbs, proximity to industrial zones and waste burning has led to persistent pollution levels above the city's average,"" the report stated. Open burning of municipal waste and emissions from ports and refineries added to the load. NCAP, which initially targeted a 20-30% reduction in PM2.5 and PM10 levels by 2024, later revised the target to a 40% reduction by 2026, the report said.
""Mumbai's increasing pollution levels reflect the challenges of urban expansion, vehicular density, and localised industrial emissions,"" said Ronak Sutaria, Founder of Respirer. Accelerating EV adoption, strict industrial pollution control, and better waste management practices, it said, can help Mumbai clean up its act."

The committee included senior scientists from Odisha State Pollution Control Board (OSPCB) and the Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA), as well as the district collector (Boudh) or a representative not below the rank of additional district magistrate (ADM). The bench also issued notices to the chief secretary, member secretary of OSPCB, and regional director of CGWA.
NGT's east zone bench in Kolkata ordered the probe and issued the notices on a petition filed by Kishore Kumar Meher, a Boudh-based social worker. The petition alleged that more than 400 cubic metres of untreated wastewater were discharged every day by the rice mill into the adjoining Bandhamunda Nalla, which joins the Mahanadi at Nuapali, two km away.
Besides, unchecked dumping of solid waste as well as husk ash outside the mill is causing air pollution, the petition alleged. Advocate Sankar Prasad Pani made submissions on behalf of the petitioner through virtual mode.

Taking note of it, the bench of B. Amit Sthalekar (Judicial Member) and Dr. Arun Kumar Verma (Expert Member) observed: ""Considering the allegations made in the original application, we deem it appropriate to constitute a fact-finding committee which shall visit the site in question and submit its report on affidavit within four weeks with regard to the allegations in the petition.""
""The district collector (Boudh) shall be the nodal office for all logistic purposes and for filing the fact-finding report on affidavit,"" the bench also said, adding, ""If environmental violations are found, the committee shall also suggest remedial measures and action proposed to be taken."" The next date for further consideration of the matter along with the report of the committee has been fixed for Feb 21.
According to the petition, the mill with a production capacity of 21 MT of boiled rice per hour was allegedly operating in two shifts of eight hours each, producing nearly 336 MT. The wastewater generation of the mill is 1.3 cubic metres per ton. Further, the mill has a requirement of 544 cubic metres of water per day but claims to use 9.9 cubic metres per day. There are two borewells on the premises, and groundwater is being extracted without any permission from the CGWA, the petition alleged."

Giving relief to defaulters, the ministry has extended the deadline for thermal power plants (TPP) located within 10 km radius of the national capital region (NCR) or cities having million plus population from Dec 31, 2024 to Dec 31, 2027.
All these power plants were expected to install Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) equipment to meet the SO2 standards by the previous deadline but many of them failed to do it. The FGD is a process of removing sulphur compounds from the exhaust emissions of fossil-fueled power stations.
According to a fresh notification issued last week, the deadline for TPP located within 10 km radius of 'critical polluted areas' (non-attainment cities) has been extended from Dec 31, 2025 to Dec 31, 2028and for those located in other areas from Dec 31, 2026 to Dec 31, 2029. On the other hand, the TPPs which may opt to retire by Dec 31, 2030 will be exempted from the compliance. Earlier, their deadline for retirement was Dec 31, 2027.

The coal-fired thermal power plants are required to comply with the SO2 emission norms within these stipulated timelines, failing which environmental compensation for non-compliance will be imposed on the thermal power plants accordingly.
Since SO2 is a significant air pollutant with direct and indirect effects on human health, the ministry had in 2015 notified the rules to make it mandatory for the TPPs to achieve the target for emission standards and install FGD by Dec, 2017.
The deadline has since been extended four times for one or the other reasons, including once due to Covid-19 pandemic.
SO2 is a precursor to the formation of the hazardous fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which has been linked to many health issues, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.
Reports suggest that India was the largest emitter of SO2 globally in 2022, accounting for over 20% of the world’s anthropogenic emissions.
According to an analysis done by a policy think tank, Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), only less than 8% of the total coal-fired power plants electricity generation capacity has installed FGD to control SO2 emissions and the progress on installing the equipment has been slower than anticipated, with delays evident across multiple stages, since 2019.
The power ministry had in August last year informed the Lok Sabha that the FGD was being installed in 537 units in coal-based TPP across the country. By July 2024, only 39 units had installed the FGD whereas the remaining units were at different stages, including contract and tendering process, of installing the critical equipment.
Referring to the delay in installing the required equipment to meet SO2 emission norms, the ministry had said since FGD technology was new in the country, there were limited vendors with limited capacity to supply and install FGD components.
“Vendors’ capacity for FGD installation is about 16-20 GW (33 to 39 units) in the country and time taken for installation is about 44 to 48 months. A sudden surge of demand has arisen, as all thermal generating units are to comply with SO2 emission norms within a short period which created huge gap between demand and supply of FGD equipment,” it said.
Though India’s manufacturing capability of FGD components has increased, it still depends on the imports from other countries. “Further, a huge foreign exchange for importing technology, equipment and skilled manpower from other countries is also required,” said the ministry.
It had further informed the Lok Sabha that the installation of FGD systems had also faced difficulties in terms of conceptualization, design challenges etc. “Standardisation could not be done as different sites have different requirements like space constraints, lay-out and orientation etc.,” said the ministry in its response to a Parliament Question."

Eight of the 24 active monitoring stations—in Borivli East, Navy Nagar in Colaba, Malad West, Mazgaon, Chembur, Shivajinagar in Mankhurd, Kandivli West and Deonar —recorded AQIs between 235 and 290, while eight others had ‘unsatisfactory' air (151-200 AQI, see graphic).
Mumbai's air quality has been worsening since the onset of winter. On Tuesday, two areas fell in the ‘very poor' category while five others were just marginally better. At the beginning of the month, 11 monitoring stations were in the 200-300 zone.
Even moderate levels of pollution can cause breathing difficulties in people with lung or heart disease, children and older adults. Health experts have advised citizens, particularly the elderly, young children and those who are immunocompromised, to limit outdoor activities during peak pollution hours, wear appropriate masks when stepping outside, and to ensure proper ventilation indoors.
Experts said that the current atmospheric conditions, particularly reduced wind speed associated with winter, have created the perfect environment for pollutants to remain suspended in the air. They said cooler air masses have effectively trapped warmer air from the sea, leading to minimal air circulation and pollutant dispersal across major suburbs. They suggested that these conditions will persist till wind patterns or temperatures change significantly.

Local authorities are implementing various measures to control pollution levels, including regular water sprinkling at construction sites, strict enforcement of dust control norms and increased monitoring of industrial emissions.
Alarming pollution levels in the city last year had prompted the central govt, multiple civic and state agencies, and Bombay high court to intervene and impose strict guidelines to improve the quality of air.

It pointed out that the annual pollution trend has risen for two consecutive years despite the decline in harvest stubble burning in the neighbouring states.
The annual PM2.5 concentration increased to 104.7 micrograms per cubic metre in 2024 — a 3.4% rise from 2023. The PM2.5 levels has increased after consistently declining and stabilising between 2018 and 2022, says CSE.

Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, CSE, said, ""This cannot be seen as an aberration due to meteorological factors. The consistent rise indicates the impact of the growing pollution in the region. Delhi seems to be losing its air quality gains from past action.""

She added that the capital could hide behind the smokescreen of farm fires anymore. Despite a 71.2% drop in stubble fires in Oct-Dec last year, the winter pollution has upset the annual trend.
According to the analysis, the city-wide winter PM2.5 average for Oct-Dec 2024 was 178.3 micrograms per cubic metre, a level consistent with the average since large-scale monitoring began in 2018-19. This is 4.6% higher than the three-year 2021-23 winter average.
Sharanjeet Kaur, programme officer at CSE's Urban Lab, said real-time data from Delhi's monitoring stations for the Oct 1-Dec 31 period revealed a troubling 26% surge in peak pollution levels compared with those in the previous year during the early phase of winter.
Last year, 121 days met the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, a trend similar to 2019, when the second-worst annual average was recorded at 109.1 micrograms per cubic metre. However, there has been a noticeable decline in the number of good air quality days, dropping from 152 days in 2023 to 121 in 2024.
Even this winter, only eight out of 37 air quality monitoring stations logged improved seasonal averages compared with the last three years. The most notable improvements were observed at DTU and NSIT Dwarka, which recorded 26% and 22% lower seasonal averages, respectively, compared to the mean of the previous three winters.
However, increased seasonal PM2.5 levels were recorded at CRRI Mathura Road (22% rise), Aya Nagar (17%), Ashok Vihar and Vivek Vihar (both 15%) and Pusa IMD (14%).
CSE researchers said that Delhi could have stabilised the annual PM2.5 levels since 2018 (if the existing air quality monitors are considered) and could have even recorded a declining trend since 2013 (if the oldest five stations are considered) had the city implemented the directives of the Supreme Court on energy transition in transport and industry sectors.
Roychowdhury said: ""The fact that annual trends have risen for two consecutive years despite the decline in farm fires shows much deeper systemic changes are required to cut the round-the-year emissions from a variety of sources in Delhi and the surrounding region."""

Rush hour in the West African country's major cities is a frenetic medley of minibuses, mopeds, shared taxis and three-wheeled vehicles known as ""kekehs"" -- each spluttering toxic emissions into the atmosphere.
Samba said that his uncle died from a respiratory illness after years of inhaling roadside exhaust fumes, spurring the 23-year-old to develop his own model for an electric kekeh.
Assembled from recycled scrap metal and powered by batteries, the pink four-wheeled vehicle now roams the streets of the capital.

Although the project is still in its infancy, Samba aims to offer an eco-friendly alternative to traditional fuel-run models.
""I wanted to save others from dying of lung and respiratory disease due to air pollution... by manufacturing a prototype electric vehicle,"" Samba said.
Worldwide, an estimated 4.2 million premature deaths per year are attributed to outdoor air pollution, the World Health Organization (WHO) says, with low- and middle-income countries overwhelmingly impacted.
Vehicle emissions are also a leading contributor to climate change.
Like in much of West Africa, lengthy traffic jams in Sierra Leone's major cities and poorly maintained vehicles with inefficient exhausts exacerbate the emissions problem.
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) says that in 2021, fine particle air pollution killed 1,200 people in Sierra Leone, a country of 8.5 million people.
- 'Good for business, environment' -
Samba first ventured into engineering when he built an electric wheelchair for his uncle, who had long struggled to access public transport.
He has since set up his own company, Sierra Electric, with the aim of eventually manufacturing a fleet of solar-powered kekehs and disability-friendly electric vehicles.
Lacking the immediate means to cover production costs, Samba has partnered with start-up NEEV Salone to develop a kekeh powered by a rooftop solar panel.
The Freetown-based firm already has a fleet of more than 100 solar tricycles, three charging stations and battery swapping cabinets for customers, according to co-founder and operations officer Emmanuella Sandy.
""Our e-kekeh products are thriving. We swap batteries to reduce waiting time for commercial riders and we have trained 60 university students from the mechanical engineering department on electric vehicle assembly and maintenance,"" she said.
The development of electric vehicles faces numerous hurdles in Sierra Leone, where the national grid suffers from chronic underperformance and frequent outages, and a six-month rainy season hampers the functioning of solar panels.
Just over 20 percent of households have access to electricity via the national grid or mini-grids, according to a 2024 World Bank report.
NEEV Salone alternates between solar power, off-grid generators and the national grid to maintain supply to their charging points.
Samba says solar kekehs are cheaper to run than fuel-powered alternatives, as drivers face lower maintenance costs and no fuel bill.
The smallest of NEEV Salone's solar kekehs sells for 120,000 new leones (around $5,270), a high price for those living in one of the world's poorest countries.
Despite the cost, some drivers have already converted to renewables in the face of rising fuel prices.
""The solar tricycle is comfortable and a profitable business. I no longer worry about fuel scarcity in the country,"" said 25-year-old driver Thomas Kanu.
""The solar kekeh is good for business and our environment."""

The air quality index (AQI) calendar revealed that the Ballygunge Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station (CAAQMS) located at BITM logged had 10 ‘poor' (AQI: 201-300) and six ‘moderate' (AQI: 101-200) days, while all the six remaining stations reported less than 10 ‘poor' days. Salt Lake turned out to be the second-worst station with six ‘poor' days.
KMC, which has been using mist cannons and water sprinklers to keep pollution at check, found construction activities in the vicinity of the Ballygunge station responsible for the spike in air pollution. Civic officials mainly blamed work at Sunny Park and a ready-to-mix concrete plant at Ballygunge Army camps. ""We have asked both the sites to sprinkle water adequately during the operation. We have suggested to the army camp that if they do not have the mechanism ready for containing air pollution in the area, we can deploy our machinery to contain it as the air pollution is equally affecting army personnel there,"" said a KMC official.
Rabindra Sarobar had the best possible air quality days in Dec. The Rabindra Sarobar CAAQMS had 14 ‘moderate,' two ‘satisfactory' days, and only one ‘poor' day. It is followed by Jadavpur with the same number of moderate days, but two poor days and one satisfactory day.

Experts said among the 12 pollutants identified by the Central Pollution Control Board, only two (PM2.5 and PM10) exceeded the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) in Kolkata in winter. The seasonal variation of pollutants is meteorologically governed. Due to Kolkata's location in the lower Ganga basin, airborne pollutants enter Bengal from neighbouring states in the upper Ganga basin, contributing to the city's pollution load, said a state PCB official.

An Air Quality Index (AQI) in the range of 0-50 is regarded as good, 51-100 as satisfactory, while 101-200 reflects moderate air quality. Levels between 201-300 are considered poor, 301-400 is very poor, and 401-500 is severe.
In light of these hazardous conditions, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) invoked Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across the National Capital Region (NCR) with immediate effect on Monday night.

Track pollution levels in your city
This decision followed a sharp escalation in AQI levels, which exceeded the critical threshold of 400. The AQI readings rose from 399 at 9pm to 401 at 10pm on Monday night.
An official order dated December 16, issued by RK Agrawal, director of the GRAP sub-committee, stated ""In pursuance of the Supreme Court's directives, the sub committee hereby invokes the Stage-IV of the Schedule under the GRAP, as comprehensively revised and issued on December 13, 2024, with immediate effect.

According to data compiled by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) Air Monitoring Centre, AQI was ‘Satisfactory' on 140 days, ‘Moderate' on 137 days, and ‘Poor' on 16 days. The city did not report any days under the more alarming ‘Very Poor' or ‘Severe' categories, marking a slight decline in pollution levels compared to the previous year.
Environment researcher Prof Suresh Chopne, president of the Green Planet Society, credited the slight improvement in air quality to unseasonal rainfall and weather changes, rather than systematic policy measures. ""The absence of ‘Very Poor' or ‘Severe' air quality days is a relief, but the increase in particulate matter and ground-level ozone pollution raises serious health concerns,"" he noted.
The winter months from October to January continued to be the most polluted, with 113 out of 123 days recording poor air quality. January and November were particularly alarming, with all days marked as polluted. The summer months from February to May also fared poorly, with 114 out of 121 days showing AQI levels above ‘Good'. During the monsoon (June to September), traditionally a time of cleaner air, pollution persisted on 76 out of 122 days, driven by ozone pollution, which was recorded on 54 days.

Comparing 2023 to 2024, the number of polluted days dropped from 333 to 293, reflecting a modest but crucial improvement. However, as Prof Chopne pointed out, ""The reduction in pollution is more likely linked to climatic conditions than implementation of concrete measures under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP). There is a long way to go before Chandrapur achieves sustainable air quality.""
The data also revealed that the Khutala industrial area consistently recorded higher pollution levels than the city's main air monitoring centre near the bus stand. Additionally, regions like Ghuggus showed even more severe pollution levels, reflecting the pressing need for targeted intervention.
Despite the slight improvement in air quality, Chandrapur's urban areas and industrial belts remain heavily polluted, with the primary contributors being vehicular emission, industrial activity, coal combustion, and waste burning. The rising cases of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, coupled with the lack of a comprehensive health survey since 2006, add to the urgency for action.
Prof Chopne urged local representatives and authorities to prioritise public health by implementing stricter pollution control measures and conducting a health survey. He also called for providing free medical treatment to those suffering from pollution-induced ailments, a demand approved in a recent meeting of the Chandrapur Municipal Corporation.
Chandrapur is part of the National Clean Air Programme, which provides funding and support for air quality improvement. However, experts emphasise that more focused and effective measures are urgently needed to address the city's air pollution crisis.

Coimbatore: Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation (CCMC) might face an uphill task in implementing its decision to shift wholesale vegetable and fruit markets to the Vellalore integrated bus terminus.
Vegetable and fruit traders have opposed the move citing air and water pollution close to the bus stand location due to Vellalore dump yard. They have also said there was a housefly menace in the place due to the dump yard, which might infect fruits and vegetables.
President of MGR Wholesale Traders Associations Vasu told TOI that Vellalore bus stand site is completely unfavourable for vegetable and fruit market.
""It has multiple disadvantages. The entire place is filled with foul smell that cannot be withstood by traders and customers. The smell escalates when it rains. Vegetables and fruits, being perishable goods, are easily vulnerable to infections,'' he said.

The civic body had in its recent council meeting passed a resolution to shift the wholesale vegetable and fruit markets to the partially constructed integrated bus terminus near Vellalore. CCMC commissioner M Sivaguru Prabhakaran said according to the plan MGR market, Lorry Pettai at Ukkadam, and fruits market at the rear end of RS Puram would be shifted. ""The move would decongest traffic in Coimbatore as vegetable and fruit trucks need not enter the city where the market is located,"" he said.
However, traders have opposed the plan.
""The infrastructure built for the bus terminus is entirely different from the market setup. Most of the traders from the MGR market have opposed the civic body's decision. Many customers would barely opt to travel long to purchase a daily load, which could directly impact the sales of the market,"" Vasu added.
A wholesale fruit trader from Karuppa Goundar Street said they would not shift to Vellalore. ""Most traders here have been functioning in their building and would not want to shift to rented premises in Vellalore. Perhaps, 30-40% shops will be shifted. Most of us have informed our refusal to shift,"" he said."

CAQM director (Technical) RK Agarwal said in a press statement that noting an increasing trend in AQI levels in Delhi-NCR, the sub-committee on GRAP, in its meeting on Friday, reviewed the air quality scenario in the region as well as India Meteorological Department (IMD) and IITM forecast.
GRAP III enforces strict restrictions on construction and demolition activities in Delhi-NCR, a ban on operations of stone crushers, mining activities, and also a ban on BS III (diesel and petrol) and BS IV (petrol) vehicles in NCR cities.
UPPCB Noida regional officer Utsav Sharma said the department will ensure compliance with the CAQM GRAP III in the area.
GRAP I measures were earlier invoked on Oct 14, GRAP II on Oct 21, GRAP III on Nov 15 and GRAP IV on Nov 17.
However, the air quality improved and GRAP IV measures were revoked on Dec 25 and GRAP III measures on Dec 27.
Noida's Sector 62 recorded an AQI of 421 in the ""severe"" category, followed by Sector 116 at 374 and Sector 1 at 312 — both in the ""poor"" category.
Sector 125's AQI was 241 in the ""poor"" category.
In Greater Noida, Knowledge Park V and Knowledge Park III recorded ""very poor"" AQIs at 368 and 307.

""The predominant surface wind came from the north-west direction with a wind speed of less than 10 kmph till evening on Friday. The wind speed further decreased, becoming less than 6 kmph during the night. The city also recorded smog and shallow to moderate fog in the morning and evening hours,"" the bulletin said.
IITM further said that on Saturday, the predominant surface wind is likely to be from the north-west direction with a speed of less than 4 kmph during morning hours.
""Smog and moderate fog in most places and dense fog in isolated places are likely in the morning. The wind speed will gradually increase, becoming 4-6 kmph from the variable direction during the afternoon. It will decrease thereafter, becoming less than 4 kmph from the south-west direction during the evening and night,"" it said.
The maximum mixing height was recorded at 480 meters, which is likely to reach 500 meters on Saturday.
""Delhi-NCR is exhibiting an increasing trend owing to dense fog, low mixing height, variable winds and unfavourable meteorological conditions. Further, the forecasts suggest a likelihood of the AQI to particularly remain in this adverse range for the coming days owing to unfavourable meteorological conditions.

In the first phase, 15 mist sprayers will be installed along a 500-metre stretch on Lodhi Road. ""Each electricity pole will have five nozzles, and every nozzle will feature six spray holes, having 30 spray points per pole. The system will consume 81 litres of water per pole per hour,"" NDMC vice-chairman Kuljeet Chahal said on Monday.
To support the operation, four tanks, each with a 5,000-litre capacity, will store only treated water from sewage treatment plants (STPs) to conserve fresh water. ""The initiative is taken up as per Prime Minister's mission for ‘ease of living'. The project is currently in its initial phase and will be implemented next year, with plans to complete the work in a time-bound manner,"" said Chahal. Once successfully implemented on Lodhi Road, the project will be expanded to key locations like Shanti Path and Africa Avenue in phase II, and eventually rolled out across the entire NDMC jurisdiction.
The sprayers will be installed at a certain height to mitigate the smog effectively to maximise pollutant reduction. ""Unlike mechanical road sweepers, these will constantly spray mist in an area and bring a major change in pollution levels,"" said Chahal.

NDMC has so far implemented several anti-pollution steps, including engaging mechanical sweepers equipped with GPS trackers, anti-smog guns and mist spray machines. ""Water tankers with a capacity of 5,000 to 10,000 litres are used for watering roadside trees and shrubs. With the implementation of GRAP III on Monday, we will intensify their use,"" said Chahal, adding that dust control measures are being strictly enforced at construction sites.
Last month, Delhi Development Authority also launched a pilot project in sectors 6 and 7 in Dwarka, where 14 electric poles, each with 30 nozzles, on the central verge were modified for spraying mist for 24 hours.

A similar trend was observed for NO2, as 2024 recorded the highest annual average in the past five years. Average annual NO2 increased to 43 micrograms per cubic metre in 2024, compared to 38 in 2020, 40 in 2021, 38 in 2022, and 34 micrograms per cubic metre in 2023. The national annual standard is 40 micrograms per cubic metre, and the WHO's annual guideline is 10 micrograms per cubic metre. The monthly average in Dec 2024 for NO2 was 63 micrograms per cubic metre.
The average ground-level ozone concentration rose to 34 micrograms per cubic metre in 2024, as opposed to 27 micrograms per cubic metre in 2023. However, the NAAQS for an eight-hour average is 100 micrograms per cubic metre, and the WHO's guideline for the peak season is 60 micrograms per cubic metre.
Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst at the think tank Envirocatalysts, said year-round high levels of all major pollutants, including during the monsoon, are deeply concerning. ""Not just because they exceed the NAAQS and the WHO guidelines, but also because there has been no significant reduction since 2017, the base year for the National Clean Air Programme, which aimed for a 40% reduction in particulate matter levels by 2026. A complete transformation in air pollution regulation and enforcement is urgently needed, focusing on absolute emission load reduction across all polluting sectors within Delhi-NCR and the broader air-shed,"" said Dahiya.
Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director for research and advocacy at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said air pollution is now a multi-pollutant crisis increasing the health risk. ""The increase in the levels of gases is indicative of rising emissions from vehicles, industry, waste burning and other combustion sources. These gases are not only harmful in themselves but also contribute towards the formation of secondary particles in the air that can be 25% of PM2.5 concentration during winter. The clean air programme must target PM2.5, NO2, and ozone together, instead of only PM10 (that is coarse dust), to meet the clean air benchmarks,"" she said.
Dipankar Saha, former head of Central Pollution Control Board's air laboratory, said the control of local area pollution is a long-term programme, thus immediate response may not be possible all the time. ""It will take some time when the infrastructures for control of emissions from municipal waste, construction and other waste management and road management are in place,"" said Saha."

Municipal commissioner Puli Srinivasulu said they have decided to take up construction of major roads in drain-to-drain mode to contain the spread of dust on roads. ""We will switch to scientific methods to achieve better results. The national award was also a reward for the citizens who cooperated with the civic body. We are taking people along with us in making the programme a success. We are hopeful of getting better results with the new approach,"" said Srinivasulu.
He said they have already constructed JKC college road and IV lane in Brodiepet in end-to-end BT cover as a pilot project and plan more roads in similar model to bring down the spread of air pollution. ""We have noticed that leaving a portion of major roads without any cover is resulting in more air pollution. We found that dust is razing on the main roads because pedestrian walkways or a portion on both sides of the major roads are left as gravel roads while 80 percent will be covered with BT or CC. The leftover gravel portion is spreading dust when vehicles move on them,"" he explained.
GMC has fitted two more air quality testing kits — one each at govt general hospital, Auto Nagar AIIC building, Nalanda Nagar, and municipal travellers bungalow. Pollution Control Board authorities will monitor the air quality levels and send reports to the GMC from time to time.

The smog crisis has led to widespread respiratory ailments, with recent figures revealing over 1.8 million individuals have fallen ill in the past month due to smog-related issues. Of these, approximately 1,29,229 have required hospital treatment for respiratory conditions, while 61,00,153 have been diagnosed with cardiothoracic conditions, underscoring the grave health impacts.
In Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city and bustling economic hub, the AQI of 164 reflects persistent pollution from heavy traffic, industrial zones, and port activities. Despite initiatives to curb pollution, the city remains in the “unhealthy” category, raising concerns for residents, especially those with pre-existing health conditions.

Yasir Hussain, director of the Climate Action Centre (CAC), emphasised the role of vehicular emissions in exacerbating air pollution during a press conference at the Karachi Press Club. He noted that vehicle emissions are responsible for 60 per cent of Karachi’s pollution and 80 per cent of Lahore’s, with both cities experiencing severe environmental and health consequences.
The air quality crisis has coincided with a measles outbreak in the region, further straining healthcare systems. Doctors have warned of the disease’s high contagion rate and urged parents to ensure timely vaccinations for children aged between nine months and 1.5 years to prevent fatalities.

The first-ever survey of municipal waste burning in the city has revealed this.
The survey was conducted as the city was identified as a non-attainment city under the National Clean Air Programme. This means air quality was not up to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) between 2011 and 2015. Waste burning was identified as a contributor to air pollution.
The survey was conducted by the World Resources Institute (WRI) in collaboration with the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC). WRI is helping VMC in its efforts under its Accelerator for Clean Air Actions (ACAAS) initiative.
According to the survey report, burning waste components such as plastic, e-waste, styrofoam, rubber and textiles releases harmful carcinogens, posing serious health risks. Open waste burning emits particle-bound metals, which have higher carcinogenic potential than wood combustion. Thus, those living near places with regular waste burning episodes have a higher risk of cancer, it adds.

The WRI survey was conducted using a transect walk method. The survey, carried out in May and Dec 2023, focused on collecting granular data on municipal solid waste (MSW) burning incidents in the VMC area. The city was divided into zones based on socioeconomic status (SES) and land use.
The survey revealed that the burning of waste was a serious problem in industrial areas, which had the highest instances of waste burning both in summer and winter. This was followed by the middle socioeconomic status (SES). The lower-middle SES and higher SES areas stood third and fourth in both seasons.
Instances were surprisingly high in summer compared to winter. The composition of the waste burned in the two seasons also varied significantly, as most waste being burned in winter was for heat.
The survey revealed that for many households, burning MSW was considered an easy and convenient way to dispose of waste, especially to avoid accumulation in the vicinity. Others said they missed the waste collection truck, or the waste collection services were irregular. Waste collectors themselves burned waste on some occasions. Industrial areas were hotspots for waste burning, often for material extraction purposes.
VMC's in-charge solid waste manager and environmental manager, Kashyap Shah, said the civic body conducted two rounds of awareness programmes at the ward level after the survey began. ""There is significant improvement after we began work. Regular monitoring of areas where waste burning took place has also started. People have also become aware and have started complaining if they spot waste being burned in their neighbourhood,"" said Shah.
Shah said the report was discussed in the presence of all deputy municipal commissioners, assistant municipal commissioners and other officials. ""Everyone has agreed that it should be implemented and the issue should be tackled as a priority,"" said Shah."

Similarly, the TMC issued show-cause notices to 39 construction sites for allegedly flouting dust pollution control mandates. Panvel City Municipal Corporation, too, served notices to 164 builders for violating pollution norms.
Meanwhile, BMC's commissioner Bhushan Gagrani on Wednesday directed the administration to continue restrictions imposed on construction projects in the Byculla (E Ward) till the time air pollution is not brought under control. Gagrani said a particular project will not be allowed to start coonstruction immediately, even if it has adhered to all air pollution mitigation guidelines and measures. Of the 33 notices issued by the E ward, 25 are to BMC and other govt sites while eight belong to private agencies.
The BMC imposed stringent measures to control pollution due to the deteriorating air quality. After halting construction activity in Borivli and Byculla, Gagrani paid a surprise visit to construction sites to gauge the situation on the ground on Wednesday. Gagrani inspected two private construction projects in Saat Rasta, besides the Metro 3 project in Mumbai Central and an SRA project near Joseph Baptista Garden in Mazgaon, among other sites. Gagrani also visited a SAFAR weather monitoring station.
TMC had issued a set of guidelines to be followed by developers undertaking construction works at around 297 sites. Of these, just 31 sites were found to be complying by the norms while around 151 showed inadequacies following which they were penalised and asked to ensure compliance within a set period. However, 39 sites that completely failed to abide by norms were warned of forcefully stopping construction work. Panvel civic body has also decided to serve notices to bakeries and restaurants to curb pollution."

Residents of a society near NG Suncity have drawn the attention of authorities to ""unbearable"" noise and dust pollution generated by the stone crushers, which has led to health issues, including respiratory problems, among some. The constant noise from the machines is disrupting their daily lives, the residents added.
""The stone crushers are operating within 50 metres of the boundary wall of the society. About four to five units start operating as early as 4.30am and continue till about 7.30pm. It's quite hazy in the day and flats in our society, which face the stone-crushing units, cannot even open their windows. Except in the monsoon, we see haze throughout the year. The stone crushers have been operating for the past 10 to 12 years. However, for the past year and a half, the duration and intensity of the activity has increased,"" said Sandhir Singh, secretary of Bhoomi Valley Society, which has around 283 flats.
""The civic body has issued so many guidelines, but they don't seem to be followed here. The crushing units are not adhering to any of the air pollution mitigation guidelines and the area is covered with just four- to five-foot barricades. Residents had complained about the units about five to six years ago and work was stopped for a brief while. Thereafter, the stone crushers resumed operations,"" Singh added.
The housing society had earlier written to public representatives seeking their intervention after pointing out that the pollution caused by the stone crusher is adversely affecting the quality of life of the residents.

According to the state govt, one of the primary reasons for the pollution is Patna's geographical location on the banks of the Ganga, which naturally contributes to dust particles in the atmosphere.
Bihar deputy chief minister and finance minister Samrat Choudhary raised the issue during a pre-Budget consultation meeting with Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Jaisalmer on Friday. The meeting was attended by finance ministers from all states and Union territories.
In his memorandum to Sitharaman, Choudhary highlighted Patna's unique geographical challenges. ""Patna city is located on the bank of the Ganga due to which dust particles from the banks along the Ganga are naturally present in its atmosphere, thus increasing the air pollution index of Patna city above the index determined by the Centre,"" he said.

68,Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/sierra-leone-student-tackles-toxic-air-pollution/articleshow/116532605.cms,Sierra Leone student tackles toxic air pollution,"Updated: Dec 21, 2024, 14:46 IST","This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.
FREETOWN: In his small Freetown workshop, engineering student James Samba tinkered with batteries and electrical parts he hoped could help clean up Sierra Leone's polluting public transport system.
Rush hour in the West African country's major cities is a frenetic medley of minibuses, mopeds, shared taxis and three-wheeled vehicles known as ""kekehs"" -- each spluttering toxic emissions into the atmosphere.
Samba said that his uncle died from a respiratory illness after years of inhaling roadside exhaust fumes, spurring the 23-year-old to develop his own model for an electric kekeh.
Assembled from recycled scrap metal and powered by batteries, the pink four-wheeled vehicle now roams the streets of the capital.

Although the project is still in its infancy, Samba aims to offer an eco-friendly alternative to traditional fuel-run models.
""I wanted to save others from dying of lung and respiratory disease due to air pollution... by manufacturing a prototype electric vehicle,"" Samba said.
Worldwide, an estimated 4.2 million premature deaths per year are attributed to outdoor air pollution, the World Health Organization (WHO) says, with low- and middle-income countries overwhelmingly impacted.

Vehicle emissions are also a leading contributor to climate change.
Like in much of West Africa, lengthy traffic jams in Sierra Leone's major cities and poorly maintained vehicles with inefficient exhausts exacerbate the emissions problem.
The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) says that in 2021, fine particle air pollution killed 1,200 people in Sierra Leone, a country of 8.5 million people.
'Good for business, environment'
Samba first ventured into engineering when he built an electric wheelchair for his uncle, who had long struggled to access public transport.
He has since set up his own company, Sierra Electric, with the aim of eventually manufacturing a fleet of solar-powered kekehs and disability-friendly electric vehicles.
Lacking the immediate means to cover production costs, Samba has partnered with start-up NEEV Salone to develop a kekeh powered by a rooftop solar panel.
The Freetown-based firm already has a fleet of more than 100 solar tricycles, three charging stations and battery-swapping cabinets for customers, according to co-founder and operations officer Emmanuella Sandy.
""Our e-kekeh products are thriving. We swap batteries to reduce waiting time for commercial riders and we have trained 60 university students from the mechanical engineering department on electric vehicle assembly and maintenance,"" she said.
The development of electric vehicles faces numerous hurdles in Sierra Leone, where the national grid suffers from chronic underperformance and frequent outages, and a six-month rainy season hampers the functioning of solar panels.
Just over 20 per cent of households have access to electricity via the national grid or mini-grids, according to a 2024 World Bank report.
NEEV Salone alternates between solar power, off-grid generators, and the national grid to maintain the supply of their charging points.
Samba says solar kekehs are cheaper to run than fuel-powered alternatives, as drivers face lower maintenance costs and no fuel bill.
The smallest of NEEV Salone's solar kekehs sells for 120,000 new leones (around $5,270), a high price for those living in one of the world's poorest countries.
Despite the cost, some drivers have already converted to renewables in the face of rising fuel prices.
""The solar tricycle is comfortable and a profitable business. I no longer worry about fuel scarcity in the country,"" said 25-year-old driver Thomas Kanu.
""The solar kekeh is good for business and our environment."""

In 2024, all 19 cities under NCAP exceeded the PM10 annual National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) of 60 μg/m³ for the annual average, which is a sign of caution and worry. Six cities, such as Jalgaon, Aurangabad, Navi Mumbai, Solapur, Jalna, and Kolhapur, showed increased PM10 concentration when compared to the NCAP baseline year (2017-18) concentration.

December, along with Feb and Aug, rare high points
First, the good news. This Dec has been cleanest ever, with an average AQI of 294, since the index started being recorded in 2015. This was the first time that the average AQI in Dec dipped below 300. Strong winds in the first fortnight of the month and widespread rain last week helped keep AQI low.
Dec 2024 recorded eight ‘moderate’ days, the highest number of moderate air days ever recorded in Dec. It also witnessed six ‘severe’ days, including one severe plus day when AQI touched 451 on Dec 19. The month saw four consecutive days, making it the worst streak in three years.
Dec, along with Feb (cleanest on record) and Aug (2nd cleanest after 2020), were the rare highlights in a year when the average air quality fell to its worst since 2019. Jan 2024 set the tone, logging the second highest AQI on record after 2016. Four other months of the year — May, Sept, Oct and Nov — saw the worst average AQIs for the respective months since at least 2021.
This deterioration in pol- lution not only has implications for the health of Delhi-NCR residents but also shows that the anti-pollution measures haven’t been able to improve air quality over the past three-four years.
“The measures on the ground have worked to the extent that these have kept annual pollution at nearly the same level despite a sharp rise in emissions after Covid. However, for an improve- ment in air quality, stricter measures have to be taken and scaled up to all parts of NCR and beyond. There’s also an urgent need to generate better and more granular data for more targeted action,” said Dipankar Saha, former head of the air laboratory division of CPCB.
Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said, “Implementation of the multi-sector clean air action targeting vehicles, industry, waste management, solid fuel burning, and construction needs to speed up manifold to make a difference to the overall air quality.”
Relying on quick-fix measures and favourable meteorology will not lead to a sustained reduction in air pollution, said Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst at the think tank, Envirocatalysts.
“To truly address this crisis, we need absolute emission load reductions across all sectors in Delhi-NCR and its larger air-shed, supported by time-bound sectoral and geographical targets. This demands decisive action on industrial emissions, vehicular pollution, waste management and a transition to clean energy. Without these comprehensive steps, achieving long-term air quality improvement will remain a distant goal,"" he said."

Lucknow: The pollution check of your vehicle will cost more from Jan 1, 2025, as the transport department has increased the fees for the Pollution Under Control Certificate (PUCC) for all categories of automobiles by 5% in the state, in keeping with the annual practice.
To ensure strict compliance, PUCC offenders are fined Rs 10,000 as per the provisions of the MV Act. Nevertheless, only one-fifth of registered vehicles in UP go for PUCC. Sources in the department claim ""poor enforcement"" for this.
UP has over 5 cr vehicles registered, out of which only 85 lakh may be PUCC-compliant, as per the official data of the department. Every PUCC issued is also uploaded on the department's website.
""The biggest offenders here are private vehicles, out of which at least 80% are two-wheelers,"" said sources. Most of these vehicles may be plying in suburban and rural areas or on the outskirts of cities, where enforcement is very limited. Private vehicles are not required to go for a fitness check at RTOs every two years, like commercial vehicles. This makes it easier for them to escape pollution checks. The offenders may be caught only during enforcement.

With vehicular emission being one of the primary sources of air pollution, automobiles running without regular pollution checks in the state are a cause of concern. PUCC needs to be revised every six months.
Pollution check parameters
Petrol-driven vehicles emit oxides of carbon, nitrogen and sulphur along with hydrocarbons and lead. The concentration of CO should be less than 3% in the smoke emitted to get a PUCC. Diesel vehicles are checked for smoke density, which should be less than 65 HSU to get a PUCC. While '0' HSU means smoke is invisible, 100 means smoke is thick and opaque."

Drawing on his personal experiences and observations, Das labeled the deteriorating air quality in the country as a ""massive health crisis"" that many seem to dismiss. His posts have sparked a heated discussion, resonating with some while also attracting criticism.
Bangaluru no longer a safe breathing zone, warns Indian-origin influencer

Das, who grew up in Kolkata and later moved to the United States for higher education, detailed his experiences during visits to India. In a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), he wrote about the noticeable impact of poor air quality on his health. ""Every time I’m in India, I notice my eyes water more, I blow my nose more, and people around me cough more,” he shared. He added that his parents dismissed these symptoms as “allergies,” but pointed out that these issues disappeared when they visited him in the United States.
During a recent trip to Delhi for a wedding, Das recalled conversations with American attendees who were alarmed by the city’s air quality. Initially polite, they later admitted their shock, describing the air as “crazy” and expressing concerns about its safety, even for everyday activities like exercising.

Beyond Delhi: A nationwide issue

While Delhi often dominates headlines for its hazardous air quality, Das emphasized that the problem extends well beyond the capital. “The narrative that ‘only Delhi winters are bad’ is ridiculous,” he stated, adding that even cities considered relatively cleaner, such as Bangaluru, suffer from air pollution.
“I lived in Bangalore for a year, and people there constantly coughed, had clogged noses, and experienced a range of ‘allergies,’” Das explained. He questioned the normalization of such health issues, urging citizens to view them as symptoms of a larger environmental crisis rather than mere inconveniences.

Challenging mindsets and cultural narratives

Das also addressed a cultural tendency to frame endurance of difficult conditions as a mark of resilience. ""Surviving tough environments shouldn’t be glorified as strength. It’s a crisis that demands attention and action,” he argued in a follow-up post. His remarks called for a shift in perspective, emphasizing the need to prioritize public health over misplaced notions of fortitude.
Mixed reactions to Das’s comments

The social media posts quickly went viral, garnering over 1.9 million views, 28,000 likes, and more than 1,000 comments. Many non-resident Indians (NRIs) and domestic citizens echoed Das’s concerns, acknowledging the validity of his observations. However, not everyone agreed. Some critics accused him of exaggeration, while others attributed his discomfort to ""weak immunity.""
Despite the polarized reactions, Das’s commentary succeeded in reigniting a broader conversation about air pollution in India. Many supporters saw his posts as a much-needed wake-up call, highlighting a public health crisis that affects millions across the country.
The larger implications of air pollution in India

India’s air quality issues are well-documented, with cities frequently topping global rankings for the worst pollution levels. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that air pollution contributes to millions of premature deaths worldwide, with India bearing a significant share. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels in many Indian cities far exceed safe limits, leading to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, reduced life expectancy, and economic losses.
Experts have long pointed out the need for robust policy measures to tackle pollution, including stricter enforcement of emissions standards, expansion of public transportation, and increased green cover in urban areas. Public awareness campaigns are also essential to encourage behavioral changes and demand accountability from policymakers.
A call for action

Das’s observations underline a critical truth: addressing India’s air quality crisis is not just a matter of comfort but an urgent public health imperative. His candid remarks reflect the lived experiences of many and highlight the need for collective action to combat the environmental challenges threatening the nation’s well-being.
As Das aptly noted, “We live in denial of a massive health crisis.” It is a call to confront the reality of air pollution and work towards solutions that protect both people and the planet.

Patna: Five Bihar cities, including Patna, ranked among the top ten most polluted cities in India on Sunday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) bulletin. Siwan recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 345, making it the second-most polluted city in the country after Byrnihat in Meghalaya, which recorded 348. Siwan's AQI fell in the ""very poor"" category, which can lead to respiratory illness on prolonged exposure. Hajipur, Biharsharif and Muzaffarpur reported AQI levels of 294, 270 and 256, respectively.
Patna's AQI, influenced by a slight temperature dip and light drizzle, rose from 260 to 278 in the past 48 hours, ranking it as the sixth most polluted city. The CPCB warned that the poor air quality might cause breathing discomfort with prolonged exposure.
Two air monitoring stations in Patna — Samanpura (328) and the DRM office in Khagaul (302) — fell under the ""very poor"" category. Other stations, including Planetarium (292), Rajbanshi Nagar (240) and Muradpur (227) were classified as ""poor"". Swiss firm IQAir recorded Patna's PM2.5 level at 72.5 µg/m³ and PM10 at 158.6 µg/m³.
Despite these figures, there was a silver lining as Patna experienced no ‘severe' pollution days this year. Instead, the city had 45 ‘very poor' days, 114 ‘poor' days, 121 ‘moderate' days, 72 ‘satisfactory' days and nine ‘good' days.

Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) chairman D K Shukla highlighted the progress made in improving air quality. ""This year, we have so far not experienced severe cold, which reduces pollutant dispersal. Continuous water sprinkling on roads, anti-smog guns, and strict action against open construction work have also contributed to lower pollution levels,"" he said.
Shukla added that over Rs 10 lakh in fines were collected from more than 5,000 violators of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act. Offenses included dumping construction waste in the open, transporting materials uncovered and conducting construction without green barriers.
Arun Kumar, a senior scientist and air pollution expert, said, ""The AQI in Patna has stayed within the ‘poor' category, avoiding severe levels. Data analysis shows an improvement in air quality compared to last year."""

Poor air quality, characterized by high levels of pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3), poses increased risk of heart diseases.

Understanding the Risks

Air pollution can affect the cardiovascular system in various ways. Research indicates that individuals living in areas with high air pollution levels have a higher incidence of heart-related diseases.
Exposure to fine particulate matter (those) which can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, exposes the body to systemic inflammation. This inflammation is linked to the development of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of plaques in the arteries, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes.

A September 2023 article published in
Nature,
states that
PM2.5 currently ranks 6th in terms of its contribution to the global burden of disease
. It has become an environmental risk factor and poses a serious threat to public health. The paper also suggests the following
As a compound pollutant, PM2.5 contains various toxic components, including water-soluble inorganic ions, carbon-containing components, inorganic elements and organic matter.
One part of the carbon content is single-matter carbon directly emitted by incomplete combustion of biological or fossil fuels with stable chemical properties. This is also known as light-absorbing carbon or black carbon, which is the main absorber of visible solar radiation in the atmosphere. Vehicle emissions are its main source.
Studies about the association between black carbon and CVD incidence across Sweden, revealed a weak but significant association between the BC component of air pollutants and CVD admissions and suggested that this could be a potential risk factor for atherosclerotic disease.

Now, this is just one specific pollutant out of many and therefore, the risk is also likely to exacerbate. The overall correlation between stress caused due to pollution - evidence suggests that oxidative stress plays a contributing role in the cardiovascular dysfunction caused by exposure to air pollution- is well known.

Over all, even short-term exposure may trigger acute cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks, particularly in vulnerable populations like the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions.
Vulnerable Populations

Certain groups are more susceptible to the adverse effects of air pollution. Elderly individuals, children, and those with pre-existing health issues (such as asthma, diabetes, or existing heart conditions) face heightened risks. For example, children are particularly vulnerable due to their developing lungs and higher respiratory rates, leading to greater exposure to airborne pollutants.
Mechanisms of Impact

The mechanisms through which air pollution affects cardiovascular health are complex. Air pollutants can induce oxidative stress, which damages blood vessels and contributes to the progression of cardiovascular diseases. They can also disrupt the body's normal autonomic functions, leading to irregular heart rhythms and increased blood pressure. Additionally, studies have shown that air pollution can alter the composition of blood, increasing the likelihood of clot formation. This can exacerbate conditions like deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, further complicating cardiovascular health.
Mitigating the Risks

A lot of these risk factors are categorized by scientists and policy makers alike as ‘avoidable burdens.’ These should be where our focus lies. Addressing poor air quality is crucial for protecting cardiovascular health. Governments and organizations are increasingly recognizing the need for policies aimed at reducing air pollution. This includes stricter emissions regulations, promoting public transportation, and encouraging the use of renewable energy sources. Individuals can also take proactive steps to protect their health. Staying indoors on days with poor air quality, using air purifiers, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help mitigate some of the risks associated with pollution.
Conclusion

As air quality continues to decline in many urban areas worldwide, the connection between poor air quality and cardiovascular health becomes increasingly critical. Public awareness and policy interventions are essential to combat this public health threat. By prioritizing cleaner air, we can protect not only our environment but also the heart health of millions.

""We expect to get this done by the second half of 2025. This is part of the clear air programme of the World Bank,"" said Nirmal Kashyap, head of air-cell, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB).
Haryana will get financial assistance of Rs 2,498 crore in the first phase of this project. Officials told TOI that the amount of aid could go up to Rs 10,000 in subsequent phases.
""We have identified Gurgaon, Faridabad, Sonipat and Bahadurgarh where these air stations will be set up. These stations will use modelling, which will be useful for calculating localised air quality issues and has been used in regulatory applications to develop strategies for reducing emissions,"" Kashyap said.
Every winter, air quality in Delhi-NCR plummets to hazardous levels as the region is cloaked by toxic haze created from a combination of pollutants mixing with fog.
Farm fires, commonly seen in north India's agricultural belt to clear tracts of land for another round of sowing after paddy harvest, contribute to winter pollution, though local sources play a significant role too.
In NCR, Delhi is the only city where source apportionment analysis is carried out regularly to pinpoint the key causes of pollution at a specific time.
""Gurgaon's air quality is a concern not just during the winter months but throughout the year. Local sources such as vehicular emissions, construction dust and industrial activities contribute significantly to the city's persistent air pollution. Continuous monitoring and source apportionment are crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate pollution,"" said Shubhansh Tiwari, a research associate at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE)."

This consultation comes a month after DPCC requested objections to the proposed project via email after putting an environmental impact assessment (EIA) report in the public domain.
If executed, this would be the city's fifth WTE plant. It would be executed by M/s Jindal Urban Waste Management (Bawana) Limited and would come up on a 15-acre plot.
Environmental activists, who previously opposed the establishment and expansion of a comparable waste-to-energy facility in Okhla, have raised concerns about the 30MW plant. They said that its proximity to residential areas could affect the health of people in the neighbouring villages. The facility is designed to process 3,000 MT of municipal solid waste daily, converting it into fuel for boilers to generate electricity.

The outdoor pollution is now even visible with smog and sometimes even the smell of pollutants in the air. While we are concerned about outdoor pollution, indoor air pollution is still going unnoticed despite being potentially more harmful. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), indoor air pollution causes around 4.3 million deaths annually, making it a critical public health issue.
Raising awareness of these sources of indoor pollution can empower us to create safer, healthier living and working environments. Home isn't always a safe haven, and pollution can be generated indoors through day-to-day activities, enter the house from outside, and emit from surfaces, eventually making up a complex cocktail of pollutants. Common household items release harmful gases, particles, and other contaminants into the air, adding to the pollution indoors. As we increasingly seal our homes to seemingly shut pollution out, in truth, we may be shutting it in. Moreover, outdoor pollutants frequently infiltrate indoor spaces, making homes equally susceptible.
Outdoor sources of indoor air pollution
Windows, doorways, and ventilation systems can all provide an entrance for outdoor air pollution to infiltrate a home and become trapped. The range of outdoor pollutants varies drastically. Everything from pesticides used for plants, insects, and rodents to exhaust, radon, and more can be carried in through the air or be tracked in on our clothing. Ensuring that ventilation systems are cleaned and up to date, sealing doors and windows properly, and cleaning dust and debris from shoes and clothing before entering your home are some simple ways to help reduce outdoor sources of indoor air pollution.

Stoves and ovens
Kitchens are full of potential sources of indoor air pollution. Cooking with gas and electric stoves can introduce a range of pollutants into the air. Carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, and more can be released while cooking with natural gas, while both gas and electric stoves can release irritants from food ingredients and cooking oils, especially at high heats. Using a range hood is one of the most effective ways to remove common cooking pollutants from the air.
Painting & home improvements
Home improvement projects like painting or adding new furniture can transform the look of any space, but they often release chemicals and VOCs that impact indoor air quality. The “new” smell from fresh paint or furniture can indicate the presence of VOCs like benzene and formaldehyde, which can linger. To reduce exposure, opt for low-VOC paints—typically water-based, low-odor, and quick-drying. Using a purifier will also help the pollutants clear more quickly and may reduce your overall exposure.
Cleaning
It is a cruel juxtaposition that when we clean our homes, we can simultaneously be dirtying the air that we breathe. VOCs from fragrances used in cleaning products evaporate into the air at room temperature, forming vapours we can breathe in.
We can do little to control the quality of the air we breathe outside. But there are ways we can protect our health and well-being in our homes. We can take a few simple measures to prevent toxic air from building up inside. This can help us lead longer, healthier and happier lives. Using an air purifier is one such step. A few machines offer full-machine HEPA filtration- ensuring that what goes inside, stays inside. The PM sensors and cooling airflow maintain air quality within your home all year round.

Taurus
Taurus, earthy and grounded, is particularly disturbed by air pollution since she feels great connection to the surroundings. They might concentrate on doable fixes, like adding air-purifying plants to house or endorsing environmentally friendly products. Their inclination for stability and comfort could also indicate that they give indoor air quality first priority. Although Taurus is a natural caretaker of the Earth, occasionally they require a nudge to translate compassion into more significant action.

Gemini
Gemini is an air sign and they are quite conscious of problems with air quality. Intellectual vultures, they would spend hours investigating pollution sources and disseminating information via social media or in-person contacts. Their flexibility makes them receptive to creative ideas including helping green technologies. Their restless character, however, can result in a scattered approach; so, concentrating on one project at a time increases their effect.
Cancer
Sensitive and supportive, Particularly in their homes or families, air pollution personally affects cancer natives. They probably spend money on steps to keep their loved ones safe, such as moving to less polluted places or running air purifiers. Emotional by nature, they could be overwhelmed by the scope of the situation but can direct their worry into community-driven initiatives include planning neighborhood clean-up events.
Leo
Bold and charismatic, Leo is not hesitant to lead the fight against air pollution front stage. They are probably going to spearhead awareness efforts or leverage their clout to organize people for environmental concerns. They might, however, concentrate more on outward effects than on long-term fixes. Leos are driven by recognition, hence honoring their achievements will inspire them to remain dedicated to deeper-level pollution prevention.
Virgo
Detailed-oriented and health-conscious, Virgo is quite aware of how air pollution damages the body. They painstakingly investigate strategies to reduce exposure, usually choosing environmentally benign practices like cycling rather than driving or running natural air filters. Their perfectionist characteristics help them to be excellent in developing plans of action to lower pollution. But Virgos can start to criticize others who do not match their degree of dedication, thus developing patience is rather important.

“Did you know, Amma, that EVs can accelerate faster than traditional cars and are cheaper to maintain?” “My 12-year-old daughter, an EV enthusiast, passionately advocates for our next vehicle choice. Her excitement about the environmental benefits of electric vehicles (EVs) is a testament to how the younger generation is shaping the future of transportation”, says Shwetha Menon, a Mumbaikar, underscoring the growing influence of children in the EV revolution—even if they can’t drive yet.
This sentiment echoes findings from an ABB E-Mobility survey, revealing that Gen Z and young people are proactively seeking solutions to environmental issues, rather than waiting for government action. A Deloitte survey from last year highlighted that climate change is a pressing concern for 1.8 crore young Indians casting their votes for the first time.
This urgency is crucial, given that over 80% of India's population resides in areas vulnerable to climate-induced disasters, according to the World Bank. However, a silver lining emerges from the Environmental Kuznets Curve, which posits that while environmental degradation often rises with economic growth, the demand for a cleaner environment eventually increases, leading to improved environmental conditions.

Since its launch five years ago, India’s National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) has allocated budgets to 131 cities to combat air pollution. Yet, by the end of 2023, over half of these funds remained unutilised, as reported by government data. An analysis by Climate Trends reveals that the NCAP's impact on pollution reduction has been ""mixed,"" further emphasising the need for effective action.
As health awareness and environmental consciousness grow, the shift towards electric vehicles reflects changing consumer priorities. A study from ScienceDirect titled ‘The Role of Air Pollution in Electric Vehicle Adoption: Evidence from China’ indicates that as individuals become more aware of air pollution's adverse effects, their inclination towards cleaner transportation options like EVs increases. This relationship holds significant implications for policy development and urban planning, particularly as China leads the global EV market.
Research suggests that EVs offer a multifaceted solution to pressing challenges, from reducing air pollution and carbon emissions to decreasing reliance on fossil fuels and promoting sustainable energy practices. They contribute to cleaner urban environments, provide long-term cost savings, and support the shift towards renewable energy sources. However, concerted efforts from all stakeholders are essential to drive widespread EV adoption.
Sumati Kohli, a researcher at the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT), emphasises that government subsidies for electric vehicles can yield positive externalities for the entire EV ecosystem. The recently launched PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement (PM E-DRIVE) scheme aims to accelerate EV uptake in India. With an allocation of INR 10,900 crore over 1.5 years, this initiative provides purchase subsidies for electric two-wheelers, three-wheelers, buses, trucks, and ambulances, along with funding for charging infrastructure. However, the exclusion of electric cars from this program represents a missed opportunity.
Despite earlier challenges this financial year, electric car sales surged by approximately 18% in November, marking the second consecutive month of growth. Sales are expected to climb further as automakers prepare to launch 10 new EV models, including six key midsize SUVs, by the end of the fiscal year.
Jaipur-based businessman Rahul Bhatia says ""Switching to an EV has been one of the best decisions I've made. Not only do I save on fuel costs, but I also feel proud knowing that I'm contributing to a cleaner environment for my children. The quiet, smooth ride and the convenience of home charging are additional perks that make a huge difference in daily life. Plus, the growing network of charging stations means I never have to worry about running out of power. Seeing the enthusiasm of the younger generation, like my own kids, reassures me that we are on the right path towards sustainable living.""
The path to greater EV adoption lies not just in government initiatives but also in the hands of informed citizens. By advocating for sustainable practices, demanding cleaner transportation options, and making conscious purchasing decisions, citizens can drive the momentum for EVs. Community awareness campaigns, educational workshops, and active participation in local environmental initiatives can further amplify this movement. As citizens embrace their role as catalysts for change, they can help transform the automotive landscape, ensuring a cleaner, greener future for generations to come. In this collective journey, every voice matters, and every action counts—together, we can accelerate the transition to electric mobility.

CHANDIGARH: Among the four states (including NCT Delhi), the Centre released the highest amount for stubble burning management to Punjab, according to a reply by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change to a question in the Rajya Sabha.
Of the total amount of Rs 3,623 crore released from 2018 to Nov 2024 to four states (Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh), the highest Rs 1,681.45 crore was given to Punjab for providing subsidies to farmers for the purchase of crop residue machinery and the establishment of custom hiring centres (CHCs) for in situ management of paddy straw, said Kirti Vardhan Singh, minister of state in the ministry of environment, forest and climate change.
His assertion came in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha by Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar) MP G K Vasan last week, Vardhan Singh said, “The ministry of agriculture & farmers welfare (MoA&FW) in 2018 launched a scheme for providing subsidy for purchase of crop residue man agement machinery and establishment of CHCs in the NCT of Delhi and states of Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh for in situ management of paddy straw. During the period from 2018 to 2024-25 (till Nov 15, 2024), a total of Rs 3,623.45 crores was released (Punjab – Rs 1,681.45 crores, Haryana Rs 1,081.71 crore, Uttar Pradesh Rs 763.67 crore, NCT of Delhi Rs 6.05 crore and ICAR Rs 83.35 crore).”
The minister added, “The states distributed more than 3 lakh machines to the individual farmers and to more than 40,000 CHCs in these four states, which also include more than 4500 balers and rakes used for collection of straw in the form of bales for further ex situ utilisation. The MoA&FW in 2023 revised guidelines under the scheme to support the establishment of crop residue/paddy straw supply chain, by providing financial assistance on the capital cost of machinery and equipment.”

In a recent meeting of the GST Council on Dec 21 at Jaisalmer chaired by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Punjab finance minister Harpal Singh Cheema demanded Rs 1,600 crore from the Centre as budgetary support to address crop residue management in Punjab.
“Despite providing Rs 1.45 lakh crop residue management (CRM) machines since 2018, high operational cost remains a challenge. The Punjab govt proposed an incentive of Rs 2,500 per acre, with Rs 2,000 per acre from the govt of India and Rs 500 per acre from the state govt. The total cost of this initiative is aimed at Rs 2,000 crore,” Cheema said while seeking the budget from the Centre. Earlier, a similar demand by Punjab was rejected by the Centre.
Meanwhile, the reply stated that the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) deployed 26 teams (in 16 districts of Punjab and 10 districts of Haryana) from Oct 1 to Nov 30, 2024, to intensify monitoring and enforcement actions regarding stubble burning. It also mentioned that MoA&FW deputed 31 central teams, which conducted “quality survey work from Sept 1-15, 2024, in Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh and the teams visited 275 manufacturers and conducted quality audits of 910 agricultural machines.” It added, “Further, 10 central teams conducted a survey on the utilisation of machines in Punjab and Haryana during Oct 15-31, 2024.”

India has recently made it to the list of the most polluted countries in the world and is currently in first position. Cities like Delhi and Ghaziabad have an AQI of 269, which is considered ‘very unhealthy.’ The pollution is mainly caused by significant industrial emissions, car exhaust, and crop ‘Parali’ burning. During winter, pollution levels worsen because of smoke from farming and weather conditions that trap severely harmful particles in the air.

Serbia
Serbia, in second position, has an AQI of 172, putting it in the ‘unhealthy’ category. The pollution is caused by burning coal for energy, industrial emissions, and traffic. During the winter, people burn more coal to stay warm, which worsens the air quality. Even though there have been some improvements, pollution is still a big problem, especially in cities like Belgrade.

Turkey
Turkey holds third place with an AQI of 160, marking the air quality as ‘unhealthy.’ Pollution is mainly caused by industrial emissions, coal burning for energy, and traffic congestion in urban centers. The problem is getting even worse during winter months when heating needs increasing, and coal is commonly used, significantly affecting air quality.
Mexico
Mexico ranks fourth with an AQI of 160. Major contributors to pollution are industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and agricultural practices. Mexico City, with its dense population, faces poor air quality year-round, and the combination of altitude, weather, and pollution sources often traps pollutants in the air, making the situation worse.
Macedonia
Macedonia is ranked fifth with an AQI of 159, which falls under the ‘unhealthy’ category. The major causes of pollution in Macedonia include industrial emissions, coal combustion, and vehicle exhaust. The country faces particularly high pollution levels in the winter due to increased coal usage for heating.

Bahrain
Bahrain, in sixth place, has an AQI of 156, falling in the ‘unhealthy’ zone. Pollution in Bahrain is largely caused by industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and dust from desert winds. The high concentration of vehicles and the ongoing construction boom have added to the rising pollution levels, especially in urban areas.

Uganda
Uganda is in seventh position. The pollution is hazardous, especially in cities like Kampala, and has an AQI of 151, which is considered ‘unhealthy.’ The pollution in this country is believed to have been caused by rapid urban growth, industrial expansion, and deforestation. Many people burn wood and charcoal for cooking, which contributes even more to the pollution. This makes it very hard to breathe, especially in crowded urban areas."

In the 55 districts of the state, Narsinghpur, Gwalior, and Singrauli were the three districts in MP where the air quality index was worse than Bhopal. This was revealed in a reply in the state assembly on Dec 20. The govt cited cold weather as a reason for the increased AQI aggravating air pollution in the state capital. Bhopal's AQI exceeded the 300-mark multiple times as well.
The average AQI in Bhopal was 197 in Nov, which is rated in the moderate category and was the fourth highest.
Singrauli was the most polluted city in the state, with an AQI of 264 last month. Gwalior was the second most polluted, with an AQI of 242, while Narsinghpur was the third most polluted city, with an AQI of 214. The AQI between 200 and 300 is rated as poor.
The AQI of Singrauli, Gwalior, and Narsinghpur was poor, a category which signifies breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. The AQI of Bhopal at times was recorded above 300, but the above-mentioned was the monthly average, which the govt complied with in its reply in the assembly. The AQI of many MP cities was in the moderate category but was less than Bhopal's Nov AQI of 197, making Bhopal the fourth most polluted city in the state.

The govt stated that the districts in which the air quality index level increases during winter in cities are due to reasons pertaining to atmospheric conditions. Temperature inversion occurs due to fall in mercury in winters, it said. In this, the dispersion rate of cold air decreases, due to which air pollution is not able to rise. Due to the decrease in temperature, the dispersion of gases in the atmosphere also decreases, leading to an AQI increase.
Burning of crop residues, pollution from vehicles, burning of garbage, use of coal-based tandoors and furnaces, construction works (roads, flyovers), improper collection and management of construction and demolition waste, traffic jams at major intersections, pollution generated by industries, and lack of regular cleaning of roads in industrial and commercial areas were listed as other reasons for the increased air pollution by the govt."

NEW DELHI: The Union environment ministry on Thursday indicated that cloud seeding, as an emergency measure to improve Delhi’s air quality, may not be a feasible option. This is because the specific cloud conditions required for seeding are generally absent during the capital’s cold and dry winter months, and there are concerns about the “uncertainties, efficacy, and potential adverse effects of the chemicals”.
Track the pollution level in your city
The ministry, in response to a Parliament question, told the Rajya Sabha that it shared the views of experts with Delhi govt which urged the Centre to consider the option of artificial rains through cloud seeding. Quoting experts, the ministry in a written response said, “Winter clouds in the region are primarily formed due to western disturbance, which are short-lived and travel from West to East. When low clouds form due to WDs, they typically result in natural ra-infall over Northwest India, eliminating the need for cloud seeding. High-altitude clouds, which are typically at elevations above 5-6 km, cannot be seeded due to aircraft limitations.”

Effect of air pollution of lungs is similar to the effect tobacco and cigarettes have
""The deteriorating air quality in Delhi is a considerable health risk that has been happening for a long time and thus, individual actions are highly important. Long-term exposure to elements with a high level of pollution will cause not only respiratory and vascular diseases but also mental health problems with intensity,"" said Dr (Col) S.P Rai, Consultant, Pulmonary Medicine and Sleep Medicine, Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Mumbai.

""The effect of air pollution on the people's lungs is very similar to that of several carcinogens like tobacco, cigarette, smoke and hookah smoke (sic),"" said Dr. Ravi Dosi, Consultant, Pulmonary Medicine, Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Indore.
Complications Delhi's air pollution can make one vulnerable to
""Pollutants, such as PM2.5 and nitrogen dioxide, are the main causes of prolonged exposure to the respiratory diseases that lead to the heart problems like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and stroke. The poor air quality is also a causative factor of the aggravation of the systemic inflammation, which may be a malfunction in the blood vessels and the heart, risks factor to the elderly and those who have diseases,"" explains Dr. Rai. ""Major cases of such respiratory disorders include COPD, asthma, and ILD. COPD is a progressive condition that causes breathlessness, and a man thus suffer further due to exposure to emission gases and pollutants. It is a type of debilitating disorder that results from prolonged exposure to environmental toxins such as tobacco, or PM,"" he added.
Air pollution affects mental health
""Air pollution also lead to mental disorders like depression, and anxiety. The brain's chemical deficiency and pollution are the production of serotonin and their regulation being affected mood, in addition, it was established memory loss is a long-term factor. A low AQI might also be the cause of relapsing of mental problems due to physical health issues getting. The aged, children, and those people with the diseases that were already existing are the most exposed to these long risks,"" explains Dr. Rai.
""We need to protect our eyes ears nose and lungs from the effect of air pollution because chronic exposure to these pollutants can sometimes also cause irreversible changes not only in the respiratory system but also they may increase risk of vascular events in the brain and heart causing higher mortality from diseases like MI and stroke patients were having chronic lung conditions or who are suffering from hypertension diabetes cardiac diseases are very susceptible to have greater increase in problem because of excessive air pollution exposure,"" suggests Dr. Dosi.
Stop Ignoring The AQI Index: Long Exposure To Polluted Air Can Increase Your Risk Of Heart Attack

""Exposure to Delhi's poor air quality for a number of years could have serious long-term health effects. High levels of particulate matter, such as PM2.5 and PM10, nitrogen dioxide, and other pollutants can cause chronic respiratory diseases like asthma, bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Other problems that can occur because of increased exposure to it are cardiovascular problems, like hypertension, heart attack, and stroke.

The Stage IV restrictions under GRAP had enforced several measures, including complete suspension of construction activities, restrictions on non-essential polluting vehicles entering Delhi, and a requirement for schools to conduct hybrid classes, with exceptions for classes 10 and 12.
Entry of non-essential diesel vehicles into Delhi is restricted, whilst Delhi-registered BS-IV and older diesel heavy goods vehicles are not permitted, barring essential services.
The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), which oversees air pollution control in Delhi-NCR, confirmed that restrictions under stages I, II and III remain active.
Stage III mandates hybrid learning for classes up to 5, with students and parents having the choice of online education where available.
Delhi and surrounding NCR districts restrict BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel four-wheelers, with exemptions for persons with disabilities.
Stage III additionally prohibits non-essential diesel-operated medium goods vehicles of BS-IV or older standards in Delhi.
The Delhi-NCR region implements GRAP during winter, with four air quality categories: Stage I (poor, AQI 201-300), Stage II (very poor, AQI 301-400), Stage III (severe, AQI 401-450), and Stage IV (severe plus, AQI above 450).
Poor weather conditions, vehicular emissions, paddy-straw burning, fireworks, and local pollution contribute to dangerous air quality in Delhi-NCR during winter months.
Health professionals indicate that inhaling Delhi's contaminated air equals smoking about 10 cigarettes daily. Extended exposure to elevated pollution can worsen respiratory conditions including asthma, bronchitis, and COPD, whilst substantially increasing cardiovascular disease risks."

On Monday, the LMC filed a complaint against Ramzan Ali for allegedly burning a large heap of garbage, which caused significant air pollution and left residents struggling to breathe. A similar complaint was lodged on Sunday at the Mahanagar police station against a private company in the Paper Mill Colony for burning waste on its premises.
Despite, LMC imposed a ban on open garbage burning in 2017 which includes fine for violators and wage deductions for civic sanitation workers found engaging in the act. However, enforcement of these rules has been inadequate, resulting in recurring violations.
Areas like Sitapur Road, Alambagh, Gomtinagar and Aliganj have witnessed several incidents of garbage-burning, filling the air with toxic smoke and raising serious health concerns among residents. ""This toxic smoke has made it difficult for my children to play outside or even breathe properly. The authorities must act immediately to stop this menace,"" said Rakesh Kumar, a resident of Gomtinagar.

Meanwhile in Delhi, the ‘severe' streak hit the capital again on Monday, with the AQI staying above 400 for the second consecutive day. Several parts of Delhi experienced very light showers, but in the absence of any intense rain activity, there was no respite from the toxic air. The average AQI was 406.
This month, the capital has recorded six ‘severe' days so far. Central Pollution Control Board's data shows AQI stood at 402 at 8am. It improved marginally to 398 at 11am, only to turn ‘severe' again during the noon.
""When there is intense rain activity or widespread rain in the region, it settles down the pollutants and cleans the air quality. However, the city recorded very light rain activity, which caused an increase in moisture and haziness and led to the trapping of pollutants,"" said Palawat. Winds were also calm, which did not aid in the dispersion of pollutants, he added.
According to Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the forecasting body under the union ministry of earth sciences, the air quality is likely to stay very poor from Tuesday to Thursday.

Outdoor PM2.5 and household solid fuel use are major culprits.
NEW DELHI: Delhi saw the highest number of deaths of children aged under five years due to outdoor air pollution in 2019, followed by Haryana and Punjab, asserts a policy communication by CAPHER India, which is a collaboration between IIT Delhi and AIIMS.
The Nov 2023 analysis by the Collaboration for Air Pollution and Health Effect Research, India (CAPHER), establishes that ambient air pollution affects children's health and mortality. Yet to be put in public domain, the report is based on previous research and estimate models related to mortality due to ambient air pollution and seeks the intervention of policymakers.
""In 2019 alone, exposure to PM2.5 from ambient (outdoor) sources and use of solid fuel for cooking was linked to more than 16 lakh deaths in India; of this, more than 1.5 lakh deaths were in children under 14 years,"" the analysis says. ""Furthermore, air pollution was estimated to be the third largest risk factor for deaths in children among under five children in India. Children suffer disproportionately from the health impacts of air pollution, and the adverse effects they experience during childhood can result in impacts across the entire life course.""
It added that since 2010, Delhi, Punjab and Haryana have seen the highest toll of deaths of children under five related to outdoor PM2.5 exposures. Delhi topped with nearly 20% of the total deaths, followed by Haryana with just under 15%, Punjab with around 10%, and Uttar Pradesh with less than 10%.

""In India, air pollution is the second leading risk factor for deaths in children under 14 years; in 2019, 16% of all deaths in children under 14 were linked to air pollution,"" the report says, adding that in the same period, states like Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and West Bengal saw arise in the percent of deaths related to outdoor PM2.5, while Goa, Sikkim and Himachal Pradesh were among those that saw a decline.

In states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, more than 10% of the deaths of children under five are linked to the use of solid fuels for cooking in homes, the report noted.
However, it also reported that deaths caused by household air pollution dropped drastically, with Delhi being at the bottom of the list. ""Less than 5% of all deaths under five are linked to household air pollution (HAP) in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab,"" stated the report.
According to the experts associated with the report, while it is very difficult to pinpoint if a certain death was caused by environmental exposure, heat, etc., the model estimations were fair enough to take firm action against pollution. ""These are all estimates, created from various studies. There are lots of confounders or factors that can modify the relation of exposure to pollution and mortality,"" said Dr Hashal Salve, professor at AIIMS. ""Confounders include age and gender and social factors like where the person is staying, green space, microenvironment, road traffic exposure.""
Salve said existing illnesses or something related to exposure at community levels also had to be considered. ""Air pollution cannot impact everyone equally. So we need a study to follow participants for a longer term but this will be resource-intensive,"" he said.
He added that since ""the model estimates are fair enough"" to prompt action on the matter at the policy level"", the communication suggests some actions such as incorporation of air pollution in health policymaking, working on social determinants of health such as the cost of cleaner fuel, etc.

According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, Delhi’s overall air quality index (AQI) has been over 450 in the last few days and even touched 488 recently - the worst in the country. The stubble burning in neighboring states, overpopulation of automobiles, factories, and the heavy fog in the capital are seen as causes for the poor air quality. This certainly impacts the lungs and cardio – but heavy smoke and fog, smog, impacts the eyes too. A study in the British Journal of Ophthalmology has found that residents of highly polluted areas were at least 8% more likely to be diagnosed with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD – blurring of the central vision) than residents of less polluted areas. According to studies in the iScience, eye disease possibility rises 1.48% for a 10 μg/m 3 increase in four-week average PM 2.5 concentration, which is the case in New Delhi. While visibility and clear sight dips sharply, what are the other consequences of poor air quality imbued with smoke and fog?
The eyes experience lot of dryness and discomfort at times leading to serious eye infections.The eye is a sensitive and delicate organ and has the largest moistened part of the body in the line of the outside atmosphere and this makes it highly susceptible to air pollution than any other organ in the body. And people wearing contact lens wearers are prone to these conditions as the eyes are not protected even behind the lenses. Microscopic particles like PM2.5, NO2, SO2, among others impact the eyes negatively.
A major consequence is the Dry Eye Syndrome (DES), which has seen a significant rise in urban areas with high pollution levels, resulting in redness and irritation. This condition arises when the eyes fail to generate sufficient tears for lubrication, leading to discomfort, itching, and a burning sensation. Prolonged exposure to pollutionis also linked to accelerated cataract formation. Many studies have indicated that the prevalence of cataracts in people aged over fifty years increases as a result of chronic exposure to urban smog. The studies also suggest that fine particulate matter may elevate intraocular pressure, increasing the risk of glaucoma. Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, is considered one of the common infections during this period and can easily be transmitted from one person to another. Also, excessive exposure to polluted sunlight can cause photokeratitis,- which is brief loss of eye sight, pain, redness, photophobia and excess tear production.
The structures and tissue located on the surface of your eyes are directly exposed to air pollution. This includes the eye lids, cornea (the clear, protective layer), sclera (the white part of the eye) and the eye’s natural lens. Each of these parts is sensitive to harsh irritants found in the environment, both inside and outside. When exposed, you may experience discomfort, inflammation, blurry vision and other symptoms.In long time, it may cause retinal degeneration, ocular hypertension, and may increase the frequency of eye cancer.

How do you protect your eyes in the context of poor air quality
Due to the increasing levels of air pollution during the winter months, it is advisable to take certain precautions with regard to the eyes. UV blocking sunglasses can help protect the eyes from both pollutants and the sun. In environments where there is substantial pollution, the use of wrap-around sunglasses is convenient and helps protect individuals from dust and other particles. Other ways of minimizing the availability of environmental irritants would be to use air purifiers with HEPA filters and maintaining a clean and humidified house.

If there are patients suffering from dry eyes, lubricants such as eye drops or artificial tears can be used for relief. This is precisely why doctors usually recommend that such patients use preservative-free eye drops to avoid causing more irritation. There is also need to blink the eye frequently to keep the eyes moist and nourished. Sometimes very basic habits like refraining from rubbing eyes helps prevent dirt, polluted airand allergens owing to poor quality present in the hands from contacting the eyes.
People should also use warm compresses to get relief from eye inflammation caused due to exposure to air pollution. Regular and frequent intake of water helps the body alright, but it also helps the eye as it keeps one hydrated and flushes out harmful toxins and waste from the body. Along with all these measures, regular eye appointments are also helpful in preventing and managing vision defects caused by environmental pollution as eye care specialists would recommend measures to be taken to prevent abrasions, infraction and damage to the eyes.

Even in the case of assisted reproductive technology (ART), the poor air quality level may impact the outcome. The growing concerns call for an urgent need to take up the challenge of dealing with pollution for better health and the future.
Understanding the scope of pollutants
Air is considered polluted if there is presence of harmful gases like sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and particulate matters not visible to naked eyes. There exist fine particular matters which are of one micron diameter or lesser alongside other poisonous gases, which can lead to major health issues. This poses severe risks to both male and female fertility.

Pollution, especially air and environmental contaminants, has the most significant impact on male fertility. Long-term exposure to pollutants can decrease the quality of sperm, reduce testosterone levels, and adversely affect reproductive health. Studies indicate that the sperm concentration and motility rate in men exposed to pollutants for a long time can decline by 15% to 30% compared to men living in cleaner areas. Moreover, it is associated with a 40% increased risk of DNA fragmentation. Other associated risks of exposure to pollutants include chromosomal abnormalities, impaired spermatogenesis, abnormal sperm morphology, and decreased sperm motility.
Impact on female fertility
Both men and women equally are prone to facing problems with fertility due to high levels of pollution in the environment around them. Studies suggest exposure to industrial chemicals, like BPA and phthalates, for long times that show cases of increased incidence of anovulation and reduced quality of oocyte. The effects also occur even with IVF for getting pregnant. Studies indicate that women in heavily polluted areas have 10–20% reduced possibilities of successful implantation and conception compared to their counterparts living in cleaner areas.
IVF success rates
The effect of pollution on assisted reproductive technology reflects some disturbing trends. Data reveal that facilities doing IVF in more contaminated sites have a reduced proportion of live births by as much as 8 to 15% and reduced cycle cancellations rates. These statistics reflect more than just a small segment of the population, but it represents thousands of couples who try to join the journey of parenthood and more significantly face added obstacles towards reaching their destination. Pollution is not only affecting the biological aspect but is also extending to the controlled environment of IVF laboratories. It may compromise the delicate conditions needed for the successful development of embryos.
The need for comprehensive solutions
The rising levels of pollution could be addressed with a comprehensive approach. It could be done at the health provider level whereby assessments for exposure to pollutants are included in fertility checks. Further steps could comprise improving the control of quality of air within IVF premises to safeguard gametes and embryos from environmental toxins. Raising awareness on exposure to pollution and preventive measures amongst patients also should be dealt with as a standard norm in the fertility treatment schedule.
Even as the evidence mounts of the dire consequences of pollution on reproductive health, there are still gaps to fill. A lot more research is needed in the area to understand the mechanisms, how different pollutants affect fertility, transgenerational effects and targeted interventions. The study should particularly focus on getting vulnerable pollutants and ways of protection.
With a possible link, pollution's effect on fertility highlights an important public health issue that needs to be addressed now. With elevated pollution level, the reproductive health of current and future generations is at stake. It is only by leveraging all aspects of our research, clinical practice and public policy that we will be able to stave off this growing threat to human fertility.

And what it should,"Updated: Dec 23, 2024, 07:29 IST","“Which one is banned?” Looking for a needle in a haystack
NEW DELHI: Every winter, as the Air Quality Index (AQI) in NCR plunges to hazardous levels, govt rolls out its Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) – a court-mandated emergency protocol to temporarily reduce air-pollution.
Though well-intentioned, some provisions have been doing exactly the opposite. Causing more pollution, or the reduction in pollution—if at all—is too small compared to the havoc it causes to the public. Here is a pick of four such measures that need relook:
1) Don’t stop construction, ask for clean practices
The blanket ban on construction and demolition work under GRAP impacts thousands of daily-wage labourers, forcing many to leave the city in winter. There are nearly 13.8 lakh such workers registered in Delhi alone. As TOI has written recently, most of them do not get the compensation they are supposed to get during such bans.

That aside, construction stops only in a few places and goes on blatantly in most places—e.g. thousands of home renovations or constructions. It’s beyond any law enforcement agency to identify and halt such work. What halts immediately, however, are much-needed public works like repair of badly broken but heavily used roads.
The result: traffic congestion and dust, which compounds the pollution problem. Often, some dust-emitting large govt projects remain exempt from the ban.
Possible solution: Mandate green construction practices, instead of halting work. China, for example, is making environmentally sustainable buildings a standard by 2027. Even in 2020, green building initiatives constituted 77% of China's new urban development projects. Law enforcement agencies can do random check of construc tion sites for their adherence to green norms and seal those not in compliance. This will balance the need for pollution control with continuity of economic activities.
2) Barricades = Traffic jams = More pollution
In the name of implementing GRAP, the police places barricades across the city, which brings traffic to halt at peak hours. It causes congestion and adds to pollution. To catch a fraction of non-complaint vehicles, every vehicle is halted or slowed. The traffic policemen are compelled to inhale the same toxic air. An officer said they have an app through which they can check the registration of vehicles, and also a booklet with pictures of different vehicles and specifications to help identify the ones that are banned. But that doesn’t help.
Possible solution: Govt agencies should ensure that owners of vehicles not supposed to be on road during GRAP receive a message on their phone. While some did receive such messages from the Delhi transport department last year, many didn’t this year. A system should be developed to identify old and banned vehicles plying on the roads through CCTV cameras and penalise them. And if such a system isn’t possible to build, stop this measure all together. The feasibility-desirability mismatch is just too high.
3) Stop chaotic manner of green tax collection
At Delhi’s 154 entry points, green tax collection often creates bottlenecks due to manual and haphazard processes. Of these, only 11 are equipped with RFID systems, exacerbating de lays and pollution. On average, 1,05,989 commercial vehicles enter the city every day. Of this, around 70,000 vehicles are cabs.
Possible solution: Expand RFID-based contactless systems for smooth tax collection. Create dedicated lanes for commercial and non-commercial vehicles to reduce congestion.

4) Anti-smog guns, more hype than help
Deployed in three shifts across the city, anti-smog guns spray water to settle dust but often obstruct traffic and waste resources. They hinder the movement of traffic by blocking one lane of busy roads during peak hours. The sights of cabs or private cars tailing smoke-guns to clean their windscreen are all too common! According to official data, 200 anti-smog guns have been deployed in the city.
Possible solution: Assess the utility of anti-smog guns with a data-driven approach. Deploy them during non-peak hours to minimise congestion and focus, instead, on long-term dust control measures.
5 Parking fee hikes need better public transport
Increasing parking fees under GRAP aims to deter private vehicles but overlooks Delhi’s glaring public transport gaps. Delhi Metro is the most preferred modes of transport, but last-mile connectivity is still a big challenge. Delhi currently has 7,683 buses, including govtrun DTC and cluster buses, but the number is significantly lower than the demand. On an average, 70 buses – both DTC and cluster – break down in the city every day, causing significant traffic congestion and inconvenience to commuters.
There is no parking management plan either. In 2020, the Supreme Court had directed formulation of a comprehensive parking policy, which is nowhere in sight.
Possible solution: Once the last-mile connectivity of metro improves, DTC buses are adequate and reliable and there is a single ticketing of all local commuting options, the use of private vehicles will come down on its own.
While GRAP’s intent to curb air pollution is commendable, its execution is often devoid of ground realities. For meaningful change, Delhi needs long-term, structural reforms that address pollution at its roots rather than relying on temporary fixes that disrupt lives and livelihoods.

What is GRAP?
GRAP is a set of emergency pollution-control measures ?rst formulated in 2016 and implemented from 2017 onwards under the guidance of the Supreme Court and various environmental authorities. It operates in stages, with restrictions escalating as pollution worsens.
Expert opinions
GRAP measures are short-term emergency responses, not long-term solutions. The city needs year-round actions like fleet electrification, better public transport, green construction technology, and effective waste management to eliminate the need for GRAP. —Anumita RoyChowdhury | Executive director, CSE
Real estate must adopt dust-control measures and sustainable practices like prefabrication and ready-mix concrete. Anti-smog guns and mechanised sweeping vehicles should have staggered schedules to reduce congestion-induced pollution—Sunil Dahiya | Founder, Envirocatalysts"

The air quality, however, is predicted to improve to very poor on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Met department said there was a possibility of very light or light rain on Monday morning. Another spell of very light to light rain is predicted from Dec 26 to 28.
Central Pollution Control Board's data showed that Delhi's AQI was 390 at 8 am, but as calm wind conditions prevailed during the daytime, it rose rapidly and entered the severe category by noon. ""Winds of less than 6 kmph blew on Sunday, leading to the accumulation of pollutants. Besides, easterly to south-easterly winds brought moisture to the city, which caused the trapping of pollutants,"" said an official.
""Mainly smog conditions with wind speed less than 6 kmph and variable direction prevailed over the region in the forenoon on Sunday,"" said IMD.

Delhi recorded four consecutive severe days from Dec 17 to 20, including a severe-plus day on Dec 19 at 451. It was the longest spell since Dec 2021 when a streak of six consecutive severe days was recorded from Dec 21 to 26.
According to Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, which is the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, the air quality is likely to stay very poor on Monday and Tuesday.
An AQI reading of 50 or below is classified as ""good"", while readings between 51 and 100 fall in the ""satisfactory"" category, and those between 101 and 200 are classified as ""moderate"". ""Poor"" air ranges from 201 to 300, ""very poor"" from 301 to 400, and ""severe"" from 401 to 500.

Under the influence of a feeble western disturbance, the city may see very light to light showers during the early hours on Monday. ""Another western disturbance is expected to impact northwest India from Dec 26. There is a possibility of very light to light rain from Dec 26 to 28,"" said a Met official.
Moderate fog was reported at Safdarjung, which is the city's base station, with visibility dipping to 400 metres at 7 am. Palam airport recorded the lowest visibility at 600 metres at 8 am.
The maximum temperature was recorded at 24.1 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal. The minimum temperature stood at 7.3 degrees Celsius, which is near normal for this time of the year.
Gurgaon's air, meanwhile, continued to remain in very poor zone for the sixth consecutive day with a reading of 338. It was 332 on Saturday. This slight deterioration was attributable to diminished wind speed that made the dispersion of pollutants slower, causing them to linger longer in the atmosphere, rendering the air unbreathable.

The decision was adopted at a meeting on emergency restrictive measures for air pollution control at the Kolkata Municipal Corporation headquarters on Monday.
GRAP is a software-driven alert system for multiple stakeholders to take immediate action to reduce pollution and measures to reduce human exposure to such pollutants. Depending on the AQI level, software-generated alerts will be sent to stakeholders for specific action.
This will be a highly coordinated and concerted effort to contain air pollution and its impact on citizens' health, said a senior officer who attended the meeting.

Multiple department heads, including mayor and municipal affairs minister Firhad Hakim, principal secretary, environment, state pollution control board chairman, transport secretary, principal secretary, industry and commerce, principal secretary urban development, commissioner of Kolkata Police, commissioners of Kolkata and Howrah municipal corporations, and a scientist from the Bose Institute were present.

On the basis of the AQI, the alert will suggest requisite action. For example, manual sweeping might be replaced by mechanical sweeping. If the AQI rises significantly, construction work might be stalled for a period.
If the pollution is very high, schools might be suspended to reduce the impact of pollutants on students, said a senior official.
WBPCB and Kolkata Police will jointly develop a system to punish vehicle owners based on complaints lodged by citizens if the vehicles are found to be emitting smoke.
According to Hakim, who chaired a meeting at KMC on measures to curb air pollution in Kolkata, the PCB will tie up with the traffic wing of Kolkata Police and devise a plan enabling citizens to register complaints on polluting vehicles using a special helpline.
During the meeting, the PCB brass proposed to put a leash on the highly polluting Vano cars that run on adulterated fuels. ""We need to restrict such cars as these have become a source of major air pollution for the city and its outskirts,"" said Hakim.
Regarding burning leaves during winter, the mayor asked the cops and the KMC officials to keep tabs on the areas from where the maximum number of complaints are reaching the civic headquarters. Hakim said he asked the PCB to take stern action against manufacturers of single-use plastics.
""We have asked it to set up infrastructure that will enable it to track down the factories that are secretly producing the banned plastic carry bags,"" said Hakim.

During these days of rock-bottom AQI, children are especially vulnerable. Their developing bodies, with their faster breathing rates and growing lungs, makes them much more susceptible to harmful effects of polluted air.
Children tend to breathe more air relative to their body size than adults, which means they inhale more pollutants per kilogram body weight. Their immune system is also still developing, making it harder for them to fight off harmful substances in the air.
Children tend to spend more time outdoors in physical activities, which increases their exposure to outdoor air. All this can lead to immediate health issues as well as long-term conditions and respiratory problems like asthma and bronchitis.

Parents would thus be well advised to take several precautions to protect the lung health of their children.
First and foremost, one should limit the time children spend outdoors. Keep them indoors as much as possible. Avoid sports and physical activities in playgrounds. Ask the school if attending classes virtually from home would be possible on days when air quality is particularly severe.
Installing air purifier
in the child’s room is highly recommended to filter out particulate matter and harmful gases. HEPA air purifiers can remove 99.97% of pollutants from the air.
If there is no option for children but to step out, make sure they wear a well-fitted N95 mask. Avoid going out in morning and evening when air pollution is much worse compared to other times of the day.
If the child has asthma, do not stop his or her medications. Children should also be vaccinated properly. Do not miss out on their vaccinations because this makes them more prone to other respiratory infections.
Persistently poor AQI also has long-term effects on health of children. It has been shown beyond doubt that growing up in polluted environments impacts the lung growth of children considerably. On reaching adulthood, the overall size, structure and function of their lungs is found to be much inferior compared to other adults.
Weaker lungs make them more prone to early development of lung diseases such as COPD. Some studies also suggest a connection between air pollution and cognitive issues in children. Keeping them indoors, using a mask and installing an air filter at home are some easy steps to protect your lung health from bad air.

The index read 370 against 429 a day earlier. However, Met experts said the pollution is likely to turn severe again on Sunday.
The air quality improved because wind speed picked up during the day. ""The wind speed on Saturday noon was 9-12kmph compared with 6-7 kmph a day earlier at the same time,"" noted Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, Skymet Meteorology. ""Even the wind direction changed to north-westerly. As south-easterly winds were earlier blowing in the city, they were bringing moisture to Delhi, which caused pollution to be trapped within the city."" He explained that the air improved on Saturday because of this increase in wind speed, which helped in the dispersion of pollutants, and the change in wind direction.

107,Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/the-silent-killer-why-air-quality-matters-more-than-ever/articleshow/115873952.cms,Death by Air?,"Dec 1, 2024, 23:45 IST","It's already happening. As AQI slinks back to its non-catastrophic levels by being merely deadly, the conversation around it begins to ebb just a little. Like so many other things we deal with, we adjust to it, accord it some kind of place in our lives, and move on muttering. Soon the mutters will also stop, as winter gives way to spring, and patches of blue can be seen occasionally in the sky.
Pollution might just be the single biggest threat to our health and our lives that we are facing. According to IQAir, in 2023, 42 of the top 50 most polluted cities were in India. But if you were to follow our political discourse, you would think that apart from being another stick to beat some local govts with, it has no place in our political calculations. No senior member of the govt has deemed it worthy to take serious note of it, and the same tired symbolic steps are taken every year to make a lame attempt at pretending to act.
While pollution might be the biggest problem many parts of India are facing, there is an even bigger problem that needs to be tackled first. It is the indifference with which this problem is being treated. Of course, the govt takes the biggest share of the blame, but it is by no means the only stakeholder that is complicit. As voters, we don't think it is important enough to make it an election issue. Our interest in it is as transient as is the intensity with which we worry about it the few days in a year that we do. The media also wakes up in alarm at precisely the same time every year and then goes to sleep when AQI goes back to 300.
Why does this subject evoke such indifference? Why do we feel alarmed only when cities are shrouded in a toxic smog that you can cut with a knife and sing ‘Happy Birthday' to? Other govts, notably China, faced the same problem but acted with prompt determination and managed to substantially transform the quality of the air, so why can't we? Even here, solutions have been placed on the table by many knowledgeable experts, so it isn't as if the govt doesn't know what to do, however difficult that action might be. The magnitude of the problem warrants it.

Part of the problem lies in the nature of the issue. Unless it is truly extreme, the problem is not visible. It is literally all around us. Breathing is the single most natural human activity. We are hard-wired not to notice it, unless we are sitting cross-legged in a yoga asana doing Analom-Vilom. Trusting our breath is a central human need, for otherwise every breath would be a minefield. Learning to distrust water was difficult enough; thinking about the dangers of breathing is just too exhausting.

A bigger issue is that a natural reaction among a large group of people about worrying about an issue of pollution, or in a larger sense, the environment, is an air of masculine disdain. It is seen as an effete concern of those who are fragile, who do not have the grit necessary to deal with life's difficulties, and who need to be protected from every little eventuality. The sense of ""it's not such a big deal"" is bolstered by the fact that barring those that suffer from respiratory issues and react adversely to bad air quality, for most others the consequences are long-term in nature. By the time we figure out that we should have been worried, we needn't. We might well be dead.
There is, of course, the other reality to consider. For a significant part of India, navigating everyday life is difficult enough without needing to worry about the toxicity of the air. There are many more problems that are more immediate and pressing that make the prospect of a future decline in health not a particularly compelling issue. It is unlikely that this section has the inclination to care about this subject.
For the others, the most urgent action that is needed today is to attack this institutional and individual indifference. Having a measurable index for poor air quality is a start, but the problem with numbers is that very high ones desensitise us to those that are merely high. Once we have seen numbers cross 1,000 in news reports, a 500 feels tolerable and 300, the level at which other countries shut down schools, starts to feel positively healthy.
What we need are private sector campaigns round the year that keep the issue top of mind. Hospitals need to show a running scoreboard of people suffering from respiratory disorders. Air purifiers should have an in-built alarm that starts going off when a certain threshold is crossed (this is being done in the case of vehicular speed; we hear a beep when we cross 80 kmph and then a constant sound when we breach the 120 kmph barrier). A siren that goes off when a certain level is breached. Signboards everywhere that track air quality. We need a protocol for when to shut down schools and offices so that work visibly suffers when the situation is bad. Importantly, this protocol should be based on international norms where even an AQI 0f 151-200 is classified as very unhealthy and demands significant restrictions. Mask advisories need to be issued, and smartphone apps with clear instructions on what to do at what level need to be designed and circulated.
The overall idea is to convert an abstract potential danger into a tangible reality. We need to disrupt normal life so that there is a cost attached to our indifference, particularly for people who are in influential decision-making roles. And all of this is needed not to solve the problem but to try and ensure that the real problem is taken seriously. Politically, socially, and economically, it is time to make this issue matter.

She remembers playing catch in the park near her home every evening and going for family picnics to Lodhi Garden, India Gate or Qutub Minar where they indulged in chaat, ice-cream and loads of games, soaking up the warmth of the winter sun. For Raghunath’s nine-year-old daughter Meera, however, winters seem rather dull. Smog has been choking Delhi every winter since 2016 when Meera was barely one so she is mostly cooped up indoors. Due to the recent ‘airpocalypse’, she was attending classes online for almost two weeks and spent her evenings reading books or watching TV. If at all she stepped out, it was with a mask. “Our kids are growing up in a strange time. The other day Meera said ‘Mamma, the sky is grey with a neon ogre sun’. I felt so sad to hear this because I clearly remember the bright, blue sky of Delhi winters during my childhood,” says the 43-year-old.
Desperate to give her daughter a normal childhood, Raghunath last year joined Warrior Moms, a collective of mothers who are demanding clean air and climate action for kids. Raghunath, who is a filmmaker, is also making a documentary to depict how polluted air is “silently killing” the residents of the capital, especially children who breathe twice as fast as adults. “I am not fighting just for my kid but for every kid’s basic right to breathe clean air. There is a whole generation at stake,” she says.
Warrior Moms, founded by 10 women in 2020, is now a network of almost 2,000 moms across the country. These moms are campaigning to raise awareness about the ill-effects of air pollution and pushing govts to implement measures to improve the air quality. “The air our kids breathe (in Delhi) is so polluted that its impact on their health is equivalent to smoking 20 cigarettes daily. This is not an environmental issue, it is a health crisis, and we need the government to tackle it immediately,” says Bhavreen Kandhari, one of the founders of Warrior Moms. “We mothers were fighting lonely battles for our kids’ right to breathe. We have come together to make our voices heard,” she says.
Kandhari, who used to work as a copywriter, became a full-time climate activist after seeing how her twin girls, born pre-maturely weighing just 600 grams each in 2003, struggled with chronic colds and coughs during their growing years. “Their runny noses would magically clear up the moment we went on a holiday. This made me realise it had to do with the air,” she says.

The past fortnight has been particularly busy for the Warrior Moms as they are working round the clock to demand real solutions to the annual smog in the capital. On Wednesday, more than 30 moms gathered near the Parliament to ask MPs to save their kids’ lungs. On November 14, the collective also went to the Ministry of Health to show the health minister the findings of a survey they conducted to assess the impact on the health of kids.

Based on interactions with chemists across Delhi, the moms have found that there has been a 40% increase in sales of respiratory medications and aids such as nebulisers. They also found that every third customer who bought a nebuliser was a parent buying it for a child. “We all knew that the situation is bad, but the findings show us the extent of the damage,” says Dr Mehak Segan, who headed the study. A public health expert, Dr Segan was aware of the ill-effects of air pollution but it really started bothering her more when she became a mother in 2019. Her son had a tough time during his first winter and no amount of medications and nebulisation relieved him of the persistent cough. This became an annual challenge and now her 18-month-old younger son is facing the same. “I hate that I don’t allow my kids to go out. My five-year-old keeps looking outside the window and now that the visibility is slightly better he is insisting on going to the park to play. How can I tell him that the air is still dangerous?” she says.
The Warrior Moms feel the government’s decision to introduce Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)-IV restrictions or switch schools to online mode is simply like trying to get temporary relief from a fever by giving paracetamol or trying to calm a cough with a lozenge. “This is not a long-term solution, and it does not address the cause,” says Dr Segan. “Doing classes on a screen not only hurts kids’ eyes, it can also adversely impact their cognitive and social skills. Besides, as a working mother, it gets so tough to manage with online schools.” Dr Segan wishes the govt would be proactive rather than reacting when the smog engulfs the city.
The anti-pollution moms have been holding demonstrations, signing petitions and organising awareness drives to educate the masses about air pollution. They are also trying to bust common myths regarding air pollution such as making people realise that the presence of PM 2.5 (particulate matter which poses serious risk to humans) rather than the AQI level is the correct indicator of air quality. Jyoti Pande Lavakare, who co-founded non-profit ‘Care for Air’ in 2013, feels the govt is not taking action because people are not asking for it “strongly enough.” “The awareness regarding air pollution is still limited to the educated. We need to spread awareness till it becomes a topic of discussion at the nukkad chai ki dukaan,” she says. After years of living under California’s blue skies, Lavakare was shocked when she moved back to Delhi to be closer to her roots in 2009. Her kids, then eight and ten, started suffering chronic colds and coughs and she realised almost every kid in their class had a nebuliser at home.
The Warrior Moms also act as pollution guardians of their own neighbourhoods. The group has created manuals for members, so if someone spots a tree being cut in the neighbourhood or sees waste being burnt or a construction site not following norms, they should know what steps to take to report the violation. “People circulate messages on WhatsApp but don’t bother to file complaints. We have been pushing citizens to file complaints so the issues get noticed,” says Kandhari.
Complaining is what Ruchika Takkar Sethi has been doing for years with the aim of improving air quality in Gurugram. Sethi, who is a Warrior Mom and a founder-member of Citizens for Clean Air, has been encouraging residents of Gurugram to call the fire brigade and file complaints if they see waste being burnt. The group also posts videos of waste fires on their FB page ‘Stop Burning Waste, Let Our Kids Breathe’ to get the attention of authorities.
Sethi took a vow to fight for clean air when she realised that her daughter Manavi would suffer more (she is a child with special needs and prone to bronchitis) every time waste was being burnt near their residential complex. Sethi admits she started sniffing waste fires “like a loony woman” and would report them to the concerned authorities. Three years and much campaigning later, two local civic departments banned the burning of waste in 2014.
Manavi is 20 now and Sethi is still waiting for the day when she is confident her daughter is breathing fresh air. She feels sad that families in the capital have accepted the annual smog as part of life. “The other day I spoke to my 15-year-old twin nephews and asked them how they felt about the current situation. They just said that 'we can’t even feel angry anymore because it’s been eight years of the same situation every winter'. They want to just move out of Delhi as soon as they can,” she says, adding that she felt so bad that teens were already sounding so cynical.
For the upcoming assembly elections in Delhi, the moms have kickstarted a campaign with the hashtag saansnahitohvotenahi."

Sharing his concerns on X (formerly Twitter), Rahul highlighted the need for a collective national response.
Gandhi’s statement was accompanied by a video of his discussion with environmentalist Vimlendu Jha at India Gate, pointing out the multi-dimensional impact of the crisis.
""Air pollution is a public health crisis that is stealing our children's future, suffocating the elderly, and ruining countless lives,"" Gandhi said in the post.

He pointed out that the crisis disproportionately affects the poor, exacerbating health disparities and curbing economic opportunities. ""The poorest among us suffer the most, unable to escape the toxic air that surrounds them. Families are gasping for clean air, children are falling sick and millions of lives are being cut short. Tourism is declining and our global reputation is crumbling,"" the former Congress chief said.

""The cloud of pollution covers hundreds of kilometres. Cleaning it up will need major changes and decisive action -- from governments, companies, experts and citizens. We need a collective national response, not political blame games,"" he added.

With the Winter Session scheduled from November 25 to December 20, Rahul urged MPs to discuss strategies to combat the crisis. ""As Parliament convenes, the irritated eyes and sore throats of MPs themselves will serve as a grim reminder of our shared responsibility to act,"" he said.
During the video discussion, environmentalist Vimlendu Jha identified stubble burning and lifestyle choices as key contributors to Delhi-NCR's air pollution.
Jha pointed out that while stubble burning is an episodic issue lasting around three weeks, long-term incentives for farmers are essential to address this challenge. Additionally, he called for lifestyle changes to tackle perennial pollution sources, such as vehicle emissions and industrial waste.
On Friday, Delhi woke to a thick layer of smog, with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recording the Air Quality Index (AQI) at 371, indicating 'very poor' conditions. Specific hotspots, including Anand Vihar (410), Bawana (411), Mundka (402), and Wazirpur (413), recorded AQI levels in the 'severe' category.
The Supreme Court on Friday said that it would review next week whether to relax the stringent restrictions imposed under GRAP-4 (Graded Response Action Plan). Acknowledging the drastic consequences of GRAP-4 measures, the court highlighted the potential adverse effects on various sections of society."

It posed tough questions to the state over its ""inaction"".
HC ordered immediate and urgent action to curb pollution on arterial roads and highways with severe traffic congestions caused by road and/or Metro works. It instructed the state traffic department to ease such traffic not only during peak hours but also through the rest of the day so that pollution from static or slow-moving vehicles is curtailed.
The bench of Chief Justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya and Justice Girish Kulkarni was hearing a suo motu PIL on air pollution. It sought a compliance report by Jan 9.
The court asked the state what it had done to comply with earlier directions to alleviate traffic congestion and upgrade mobile vans and air monitoring stations. Citizens have a fundamental right to a pollution-free environment and ""innocent citizens cannot be victims of air pollution and helplessly suffer on such count due to inaction of the authorities in taking appropriate, timely and continuous measures"", it said. ""We are at pains to find that none of the directions issued by us are complied with by the different authorities in totality, much less as expected by the court, when issues of serious concern touching human lives due to the impact of air pollution and a matter of serious concern arise in the present proceedings,"" it said.

Asserting that the state machinery shouldn't wait for court orders before initiating action, HC stressed that the authorities are required to not only be vigilant but be ""in a continuous action mode to control and/or weed out pollution generated from the different sources"".
It said while development/construction work and other commercial activities are needed, ""it cannot be that such activities are undertaken in an uncontrolled manner generating pollution and to the peril and health hazard of lakhs of inhabitants of the city"".

The judges orally remarked that once the coastal road ends, it takes an hour to reach the airport and 90 minutes to reach Borivli. ""So, you know how much pollution is caused when there is traffic congestion?"" asked HC while hearing additional govt pleader Jyoti Chavan for the state and A B Vagyani for Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).
HC appointed senior counsel Darius Khambata as amicus curiae and passed various orders seeking effective steps and their compliance from the state, CPCB and civic corporations against pollution from various sources like construction sites, vehicles and polluting industries. It directed BMC to activate sprinklers at construction sites, monitor small and medium-scale industries, and take stringent action against polluting units.

""Under the influence of a feeble western disturbance, calm winds have been prevailing in the city, causing trapping of pollutants. The increase in moisture also impacted the air quality. No change is likely in air quality over the next two days as similar conditions may prevail. However, wind speed may increase from Dec 23,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, Skymet Meteorology, adding that a strong western disturbance was expected to impact north-west India on Dec 27-28, likely causing rainfall and improving the air quality.

Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, ""We are going through a severe smog episode even after the crop burning season is over. This indicates high emissions from the local and regional sources — vehicles, industry, waste and solid fuel burning and construction. This has health implications. While taking whatever immediate action is possible to reduce high exposures now, speed up efforts for more deep-rooted systemic action to control the problem.""
Delhi recorded moderate fog on Friday, with the visibility dipping to 300 metres at 7.30am at Safdarjung, which is the city's base weather station. Palam witnessed shallow fog with visibility of 700 metres. The India Meteorological Department has issued a yellow alert for moderate to dense fog on Saturday and Sunday.
The minimum temperature dipped at most locations in the city on Friday. It was 7.5 degrees Celsius, which is one degree below normal, at Safdarjung.

Most employed individuals are at times restricted to the four walls of the office leading to a group of disorders often referred to as building-related illnesses (BRI which include a range of health complaints, the majority of which affect the respiratory system, including the development of asthma or rhinitis, and the skin, including dermatitis. Probably the BRI has its origin among those working in enclosed places, due to elevated indoor air pollution levels leading to BRI including hypersensitivity pneumonitis and legionella infection which is an ailment propelled by legionella’s presence in infections inducing air conditioners.
Musculoskeletal disorders make the US construction workforce one of the sickest groups, including the interior spaces, areas of which, occupants often note the abovementioned special discomfort – ""building-related symptoms"" (BRS): in the American population, BRS includes burning eyes, itchy nose, throat itching, coughing, shortness of breath, various body rashes, deep chest pain or wheezing or similar ailments, or even depression or anxiety and memory loss which are about several foci including headache, general weakness, and fatigue, trouble with concentration, and losing interest in food or smells.
The sources, both inside and outside the building, for indoor air pollution are numerous. Common sources of indoor pollution include carbon monoxide, tobacco smoke, cleaning products, as well as viruses and allergens. Pollution from combustion sources occurs in this setting as well. Fuels such as biomass and gas stoves are also energy sources. Air pollution such as carbon monoxide, ozone, and particulates can also invade buildings and cause a detrimental effect on warmth air indoors, particularly in cities where the level of outdoor pollution is high. In fact, in areas where ambient air quality is not good, trying to bring air from outside makes the situation worse at times.
Efforts to introduce and enforce policies to address indoor air pollution are pronged on two major factors. The first one is the policies are not easy to implement due to the fact that there is no standardized measure of indoor air quality, and there is no clear equivalent of the Air Quality Index, AQI for outdoor air exists. A common trend however that erects challenges is a consideration for proper ventilation and a real risk of penetration by outdoor pollutants.

Waste burning in the open is another major contributor to the poor-quality air. Waste burning hotspots include areas such as Kherki Daula toll plaza, Dwarka Expressway, Ghata, and sectors 48, 55, 56 and 65.
""Garbage, leaves and twigs are burnt here frequently, leading to thick smoke and toxic fumes filling the area. The AQI in our locality is worsening and people are facing breathing difficulties,"" Rohan Naik, a resident of Sector 65, said.

""In new sectors, there is no mechanism to clean roads or maintain green belts. There is no garbage disposal system in place. So, people choose the easy option— burning their waste,"" said Mayank Rai, a resident of Sector 85.
Smoke from burning waste releases PM10— a coarse particle that can embed itself deep into people's lungs— and pollutants like PM2.5, nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide into the atmosphere, said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director for research and advocacy at centre for science and environment.
When contacted, HSPCB said they are implementing measures to curb waste burning. ""We have asked both MCG and MCM to take steps to curb garbage burning incidents in the city,"" HSPCB regional officer (Gurgaon) Vijay Chaudhary said.
The PM2.5 level was the highest in Vikas Sanad (414 µg/m³) on Friday, followed by Teri Gram (365 µg/m³), Sector-51 (298 µg/m³) and Gwalpahari (287). Sector 51 documented the highest PM10 level on Friday at 404 µg/m³, followed by Teri Gram (310 µg/m³) and Gwalpahari (254). Vikas Sadan doesn't record PM10 data. According to CPCB, the annual average permissible limits for PM2.5 and PM10 are 60µg/m³ and 100 µg/m³, respectively.
According to guidelines issued by the Central Pollution Control Board, when AQI is in the 'moderate' category, there can be breathing discomfort to people with asthma and lung or heart disease. In 'poor' AQI, breathing discomfort can be felt by most people on prolonged exposure. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.

The corporation teams also issued penalties for littering on Friday.
""The Commission for Air Quality Management has banned all types of construction and demolition activities in the Delhi-NCR region under the fourth phase of the GRAP. Despite the ban, the construction activities are taking place and the corporation teams are continuously taking action against those who have not stopped construction activities,"" MCG spokesperson SS Rohilla said.

Meanwhile, during their area surveillance, the sanitation branch team discovered that a motorcycle service centre in Wazirabad was responsible for littering in a public place.
The team, led by sanitation inspector Jitender Kumar, found that the service station operators were dumping waste on the road.
The team immediately issued a fine of Rs 5,000 to the owner, Rajesh, and warned him not to dispose of garbage in public places, otherwise further legal action would be taken against him.
The residents said that construction work persists without interruption at residential and commercial sites, disregarding the GRAP restrictions.
They said that the MCG needs to enforce stricter controls and regulations.
""The existing monetary fines have failed to prevent builders and property owners from continuing their construction projects. The ongoing building activities exacerbate air pollution levels, whilst residents cope with deteriorating air conditions,"" Shrey Sharma, a resident of Sector 43, said.

Farmers in states like Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh burn crop stubble to clear fields as an immediate and simple solution after harvest. This practice releases massive amounts of smoke and significantly harmful particles into the air, which are then carried into Delhi by winds, significantly worsening the levels of pollution.
Frozen, unmoving winter air
During the winter months, Delhi’s cold weather causes air to be severely frozen and still. This means that pollutants such as smoke, dust, and factory pollutants are caught near the ground, stuck in one place. As a result, it accumulates smog, reducing air quality and increasing health risks for people.

Overpopulation
With a population of over 20 million, Delhi’s fast-paced urban growth puts immense pressure on its infrastructure. More people means more cars, more waste, and significantly increased energy consumption, all of which contribute to higher pollution levels.
Traffic jams and crowded roads

Delhi’s roads are crowded with vehicles, many of which are old and release high levels of harmful gasses. The lack of sufficient public transport options forces many people to depend on private cars, causing constant traffic jams and increasing the already high levels of air pollution even higher.
Fireworks during festivals
Despite the firecrackers being banned, they continue to burst during festivals like Diwali. These fireworks release severely harmful chemicals, including sulfur dioxide and airborne particles, adding to the already high levels of pollution during the festive season.
Construction and dust

Construction in Delhi is creating a lot of dust and pollution because the city is growing quickly. Big building sites and roads that are being built produce a lot of dust, especially during dry weather. This dust can make the air polluted and unhealthy to breathe, affecting the well-being of people living in the city.
How can you prevent yourself from air pollution?
Wear masks
When the air is polluted, wearing a mask can significantly help keep you safe. Choose an N95 or P100 mask because they filter out harmful particles. Make sure it fits tightly over your nose and mouth so you breathe clean air.
Limit going outdoors
Avoid going outdoors when pollution levels are high. If necessary, do it in the morning or evening when the air is usually better. Avoid exercising outdoors on days with bad air quality to protect your lungs.

Use air purifiers
Get an air purifier for your home, especially one with a HEPA filter. It helps clean the air inside by removing dust and other particles. Keep your windows closed during high pollution days to keep the polluted air out.
Keep indoor air clean
To improve the air in your home, clean regularly by dusting and vacuuming. Use exhaust fans in the kitchen and bathroom to get rid of indoor air pollutants.
Eat a healthy diet
A balanced diet can help your body fight pollution. Eat fruits and vegetables, especially ones high in vitamins, like oranges. Drink ample water to stay hydrated, and include foods like fish and nuts that are good for your lungs.
Pay attention to your health
Pay attention to how you feel. If you have symptoms like coughing or trouble breathing, see a doctor right away. Knowing your body helps you stay healthy and safe, especially the people with respiratory issues and diseases such as Asthma."
116,Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/new-insights-on-respiratory-ailments-not-just-air-pollution/articleshow/115818143.cms,‘Respiratory ailments not solely linked to bad air’,"Nov 29, 2024, 23:52 IST","New Delhi: Air pollution is one of the aggravating factors for respiratory ailments and associated diseases, however, there is no conclusive data available in the country to establish direct correlation of disease exclusively due to air pollution, minister of state for health Prataprao Jadhav told Lok Sabha on Friday.
In reply to a parliament question, Jadhav said: ""Health effects of air pollution are a synergistic manifestation of factors which include food habits, occupational habits, socioeconomic status, medical history, immunity and heredity etc. of the individuals.""
The minister of state for health listed steps taken by the govt to address air pollution issues.
The ministry of health and family welfare launched the National Programme on Climate Change and Human Health at the National Centre for Disease Control, with the objective to create awareness, capacity building, health sector preparedness and response-and partnerships-related activities on the climate sensitive health issues in the country since 2019, the minister of state for health said.

Alarmingly, air pollution ranks as the fourth-leading cause of global illness and death.
Breathing clean air is vital for health and well-being, yet this remains a challenge for many. For example, six regions in India were among the top 10 most polluted cities in 2022, based on average PM2.5 concentration—a common measure of air pollution. This is particularly concerning as a report by AQLI found that PM2.5 pollution can reduce an average person’s lifespan in India by 5.3 years compared to if air quality met World Health Organization guidelines. PM2.5 particles, being less than 2.5 microns in diameter, can penetrate deep into the respiratory tract, posing serious health risks.
Addressing air pollution is crucial for improving environmental health and ensuring a better quality of life. It’s also critical to understand what measures we can take to better protect our health. Breathing in air pollutants – like nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and more – can harm people’s respiratory systems and irritate airways. This may even cause symptoms like shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, and chest pain. In areas with higher concentrations of certain air pollutants (like PM2.5), cases of the respiratory infection like influenza, commonly known as ‘flu’ are most likely observed, too. Studies have suggested that air pollution not only weakens the human immune system but also lingers in the atmosphere for longer durations. This, in turn, allows transmission of influenza viruses to humans. In fact, poor air quality may even make patients with conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - a chronic lung disease with symptoms such as coughing, difficulty in breathing, and phlegm production - more likely to develop viral infections like the flu.
Dr. Puneet Saxena, Senior Professor, Department of Medicine, SMS Medical College & Hospital, Jaipur explained, ""Poor air quality significantly impacts health by weakening respiratory immunity. Polluted air can enhance flu symptoms, making individuals feel worse. In such conditions, maintaining good hygiene practices and getting annual influenza vaccinations are crucial preventive measures, especially for the elderly. These steps help protect against respiratory infections and enhance overall health. It's vital for everyone to safeguard their health, not just during flu season, but throughout the year. The influenza vaccine composition is updated every year based on WHO surveillance results as there is a constant evolution of the viruses by antigenic changes. The WHO continuously monitors and updates vaccine formulations to match the evolving influenza viruses. For the ongoing 2024-2025 winter flu season, the WHO-recommended Northern Hemisphere 2024/2025 influenza vaccine is the latest vaccine available in India.""

Who does influenza affect?
Influenza affects people of all ages – particularly children under five years, older adults (65 years and older), people with underlying health conditions (like asthma, diabetes, and more), and pregnant women.
How does flu vaccination help?
Boosts immunity: The flu vaccine prepares the immune system to recognize and fight the virus effectively.
Reduces severity: Even if one does catch the flu, being vaccinated can reduce the risk of complications.

With health experts voicing their concerns on the links between poor air quality and rising respiratory issues, it’s important to act now.
Dr. Jejoe Karankumar, Medical Director at Abbott commented, “Helping people stay healthy at every stage of life is important. Air pollution and respiratory health problems – like influenza – can come in the way of this. It’s important to help raise awareness about the steps people can take to protect themselves against infections like influenza, especially at a time when the burden is rising. Preventive care is important, and it’s vital for more people – especially those at risk, like children, pregnant women, the elderly, and adults with complications – to get their yearly influenza vaccination for greater protection.”
It’s also important to practice preventive good hygiene, such as handwashing or using a face mask when coughing. On days with extremely high air pollution outdoors, staying indoors as much as possible is recommended (limiting any unnecessary outdoor activities). By making healthier lifestyle choices, people can also boost their immunity and support their lung health. It’s also important to consult one’s doctor in case of symptoms – like fever, cold or cough – to ensure early medical attention for the necessary care.
People should take special care to safeguard their own and their loved ones’ health and wellbeing this season."

In Greater Noida, monitoring stations at Knowledge Park 3 and 5 recorded AQI levels of 299 (poor) and 345 (very poor), respectively.
Two of Ghaziabad's monitoring stations, Indirapuram and Loni, recorded 'severe' AQI levels at 425 and 421, respectively. Vasundhara and Sanjay Nagar stations reported relatively lower readings of 367 and 329 but were ‘very poor'. Particularly concerning were PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels in Loni and Indirapuram, exceeding 500 µg/m3 on Thursday morning.

According to the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Noida's AQI is likely to be severe on Friday and very poor on the weekend due to unfavourable meteorological conditions for dispersion of pollutants.
Meanwhile, a grim greyness hung over the city on Thursday. The AQI of 451, which was just at the ‘severe plus' level, made it the worst Dec day in three years, with a higher AQI recorded last on Dec 26, 2021, at 459. Experts said the slow winds, low temperature and fog created conditions that prevented any dispersal of pollutants.
The CPCB data showed Delhi's AQI at 451 at 8am on Thursday, which rose to 457 at 1pm before dipping back to 451 at 4pm. Thursday was the third consecutive day when the pollution mark surpassed 400. CPCB measures AQI on a scale of 0-500, where 400 indicates ‘severe' pollution and a reading of over 450 means ‘severe plus' pollution.
Dec 2023 recorded three ‘severe' days with an AQI high of 450. The highest ever AQI recorded in the month of Dec is 469 on Dec 21, 2017. Data from CPCB, which started calculating AQI from April 2015, shows that the highest ever AQI recorded in Delhi was 497 on Nov 6, 2016. Twice, on Nov 18 this year and Nov 13, 2019, the AQI was 494.
No relief is expected on Friday with the air quality forecast to remain in the ‘severe' zone. ""Since a feeble western disturbance is impacting the region, winds have been mostly light,"" said a Met official. ""Due to the western disturbance, moisture-laden easterly to south-easterly winds are blowing across the city. This has also caused the trapping of pollutants. Though the wind picked up briefly during the day, reaching up to 15 kmph, it again slowed down without significantly improving the air quality.""
The city also recorded moderate fog on Thursday, with the lowest visibility recorded at the base weather station in Safdarjung of 250 metres at 7am. The visibility increased to 300m at 8am.

The two border points that see maximum jams because of toll booths are UP Gate on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway and Kalindi Kunj.
On the other hand, Delhi-bound traffic from Gurgaon takes a hit every evening at the Shirol border, which sees the largest volume of cars at any crossing in Delhi-NCR.
Instead, the NCR body suggests that annual tolls should be collected from all vehicles with NCR permits.

Additionally, the residents' body has sought lifting of ban on BS4 vehicles under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) as these vehicles comply with all pollution guidelines and hold the necessary certificates.
Residents maintain that people with only one vehicle face significant commuting challenges during such bans.
""The main reason for air pollution in the NCR region is the jam caused by the MCD toll collection on Delhi borders. MCD toll and green toll are collected from commercial vehicles by Delhi MCD on these borders, whether from Noida, Ghaziabad, Faridabad or Gurgaon,"" chairman of CONRWA PS Jain said.

Jain said, ""Due to this, there is not only a traffic jam on the border, but these vehicles contribute significantly to air pollution. We have therefore written to the CAQM chairman demanding the MCD toll be completely abolished or else, all passenger vehicles should be made toll-free.""
Secretary general of CONRWA Anil Sharma adds that the NCR body has urged CAQM that in place of the MCD toll, a lump sum annual toll amount should be collected with whatever permit is given from NCR for all vehicles and that the Centre should abolish this toll entirely and assist MCD on revenue loss, if any.
""We demand that an annual toll be applied to all vehicles with an NCR permit at Delhi borders. Additionally, we request the central govt to abolish the MCD toll entirely and provide financial assistance to the MCD to cover any potential revenue loss,"" Sharma said.
The residents' body calls for lifting the ban on BS4 vehicles, citing that they comply with all pollution norms.
""BS4 vehicles are banned in NCR under GRAP guidelines. But they fulfil all the standards and also have a certificate of ‘no pollution', Jain said.
""Hence banning these vehicles is not justified in any way. Due to this, the general public who have only one vehicle face a lot of difficulties. Whereas they do not cause any special pollution. There are other factors which contribute to more pollution like the several construction activities, lack of authority measures to curb pollution as well as tolls at the NCR border,"" said Jain, adding that other reasons mentioned in GRAP are also not enforced forcefully and that ""just banning private vehicles is not fair"".
""Vehicles which have valid pollution certificates should not be banned,"" he said.
CONRWA has sent a copy of the letter to the prime minister, governor and the chief minister of Delhi.

Children are most vulnerable to its effects. The pollution affects their development and can cause serious health problems.
For the past several years, air pollution levels in Delhi-NCR and adjoining regions rise steeply to hazardous levels, especially between Oct and Jan. Unfortunately, victims of this health hazard are forced to remain silent spectators as the govt continues to play an apathetic role with lack of measurable action to tackle the problem.
Children are the biggest victims of air pollution with their growing brain and body particularly vulnerable to the effects of the toxins. They readily absorb the pollutants in their body and retain them for long.

The injurious effects of breathing polluted air begin in the mother's womb. The pollutants induce a state of inflammation in pregnant women and the toxins and pro-inflammatory chemicals cross the placenta adversely affecting the growing foetus. The growing brain and nervous system are especially at risk as these toxins easily cross the blood-brain barrier. Moreover, they also damage genetic material or DNA, inducing long-term harm. This results in babies born with low birth weight and developmental delays. Studies from various countries have found that air pollution is linked to an increased rate of intrauterine death and neonatal mortality. There is growing evidence linking air pollution to autism, a neurodevelopment problem in children which is rising to alarming levels.

The ill-effects of air pollution continue after birth and throughout life. Brain growth predominantly occurs in the first five years of life and particulate matter and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons adversely affect brain development in young children. In studies conducted in China, scientists have proved that air pollution leads to decreased head size and poorer neurodevelopment outcomes and intelligence (IQ) at 5 years.

In São Paulo, Brazil, sophisticated studies using time-series analysis found a robust link between gaseous and particulate air pollution and child respiratory morbidity and mortality confirmed by studies from other countries, including Mexico and China. The association of air pollution with child death was found even with short-term exposure to poor ambient air.
While we all are aware of the effects of air pollution on respiratory illnesses, including asthma and bronchitis and lung cancer, there is good evidence that air pollution is linked to increased long-term risk of lifestyle diseases like diabetes and other types of cancer. Paediatricians and parents recognize the need for outdoor play and activity in children in order to have optimal physical and mental health and to prevent lifestyle diseases like obesity. This leads to a peculiar conundrum when children are restricted from going outdoors due to high levels of air pollution. An extreme example of this phenomenon is the announcement of emergency closure of schools. The fact that these emergency closures occur year after year shows the lack of political will to tackle this public health and environmental crisis.
Also read: Why did Delhi's AQI show 494 locally and 1,600 globally?
The search for a solution has to begin by accepting the fact that we are faced with an urgent crisis and demanding action from the govt. Many countries have effectively tackled the menace of air pollution by displaying strong political will. Foremost, the seasonal pollution due to stubble burning needs to be urgently addressed by strong legislation and solutions for parali and waste disposal. A long-term solution has to be found in greater investment in technology and advancements for effective garbage disposal, vehicular pollution and renewable energy.
Children have no voice of their own. We, as parents and guardians, need to stand up for them and demand solutions from the govt. Children are the future of our nation and they have a right to life and right to clean air.

The research underscored the necessity to implement low emission zones (LEZs) in one of the state's prominent industrial hubs as a strategic endeavour to mitigate pollution.
A city's LEZs are areas where vehicles with high emissions are either prohibited from entering or are subject to a fee.
The study identified two areas in Pimpri Chinchwad as the main sources of vehicle emissions.

Zone 1 includes areas such as Pradhikaran, Pimpri, Chinchwad gaon, Kalewadi, Thergaon, Rahatani, Pimple Saudagar and Pimple Gurav. The zone, which covers 29.6 sqkm or 15.6% of the city's size, accounts for 27% of tailpipe emissions.
The larger Zone 2 includes areas such as Nigdi, Ravet, Bhosari, Moshi, Pimple Nilakh and Wakad. This zone covers 88 sqkm or 47.5% of the city and accounts for an astounding 63% of emissions.

Across the zones, two-wheelers are the main source of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon emissions, while heavy vehicles are the biggest source of PM and NOx emissions.
The study was carried out in collaboration with the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy India, which contributed to the first urban transportation policy in Maharashtra, and was authored by Moorthy M Nair.
""The success of LEZs depends not only on vehicle restrictions but also on offering socially equitable mobility options that empower users to transition to cleaner, more efficient alternatives,"" said Nair, associate researcher at ICCT.
The report emphasised the need for supplementary policies, including frequent public transport, bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure, and fair incentives to switch from non-compliant to zero-emission automobiles. It suggested that civic authorities should start LEZ planning this year and encforce it by 2026.
""LEZs are a proven strategy to accelerate the shift to clean mobility. With over 350 LEZs operational in Europe, it's time for Indian cities like Pimpri Chinchwad to adopt this approach to secure cleaner air and better public health,"" said Amit Bhatt, the India managing director at ICCT.

While Bengaluru enjoys relatively cleaner air with moderate AQI levels, Delhi continues to battle severe pollution, particularly during the winter months. This discrepancy has sparked conversations about the long-term livability of these cities, with some humorously suggesting a move to Bengaluru for those seeking respite from toxic air. The situation has also prompted political leaders and citizens alike to call for urgent action to address the persistent pollution crisis, especially in Delhi.
In a recent social media post, an X (formerly Twitter) user humorously suggested that given Bengaluru’s comparatively cleaner air, it might be time to “learn Kannada and permanently settle in Bengaluru,” while Delhi continues to grapple with severe pollution levels. This comment came amid reports that Bengaluru’s air quality index (AQI) was in the 60-80 range, indicating relatively good air quality, while Delhi was battling dangerously high pollution.
Delhi’s severe air pollution crisis

On the same day, Delhi’s AQI remained in the ""severe plus"" category for the second consecutive day. Smog enveloped the city, drastically reducing visibility and pushing air pollution to harmful levels. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Delhi’s AQI was recorded at an alarming 488 at 8 a.m., which is classified as “severe plus,” indicating that the air quality was hazardous, especially for sensitive groups such as children, the elderly, and those with respiratory or heart conditions.

How Delhi’s air quality compares to Bengaluru’s

The X user also quipped that “clean air is a fundamental human right,” but in Delhi, it comes at a cost, with an additional 18% Goods and Services Tax (GST) making the situation feel almost as if you have to pay extra for breathable air. This remark resonates with many in the city, who are increasingly frustrated by the ongoing pollution crisis.

The contrast between Bengaluru and Delhi’s air quality was striking on this particular day. While Bengaluru's AQI stood at 159, which falls under the “moderate” category, Delhi's air quality was dangerously hazardous. In Bengaluru, the air quality is relatively better, although people with respiratory issues or children are still advised to limit prolonged outdoor activities. In Delhi, the AQI levels in the ""severe plus"" category are hazardous to everyone, and prolonged exposure can cause serious health problems.

Online reactions to Bengaluru's air quality and its challenges

The difference in air quality sparked a variety of reactions from users on X. Some were quick to agree with the suggestion to move to Bengaluru. One user, Astha Kohli, raised a concern, pointing out that if everyone moves to Bengaluru, the city might eventually face the same problems as Delhi. Rohan, another user, added that while Bengaluru may offer better air quality, the challenge of learning the local language—Kannada—could be a hurdle for newcomers.
Shashi Tharoor calls Delhi the world’s most polluted city

Shashi Tharoor, a Congress leader, also weighed in on the crisis, criticising the central government for failing to address the persistent pollution in Delhi. Tharoor labelled Delhi as the “most polluted city in the world,” emphasising that the city becomes almost uninhabitable from November to January, and barely liveable for the rest of the year. He argued that it was ""unconscionable"" that the government had allowed the air pollution crisis to persist for years without taking adequate steps to improve the situation.

In this process, the regional airshed will foster cooperation among the urban local bodies, which are influencing each other's air quality.
Track the pollution level in your city
An airshed is a geographic area where air pollution is measured and managed as a whole. It recognises that air pollution doesn't stop at city or state borders—pollutants can travel across regions. As a result, effective pollution management requires cooperation between cities, states, and even neighbouring countries.
The newly published study, Designating Airsheds in India for Urban and Regional Air Quality Management, highlights the urgent need for a coordinated approach for effective control instead of tackling it in bits and pieces. This peer-reviewed study, published in MDPI's Air journal, recommends dividing India into 15 regional airsheds, each tailored to the specific climatic and pollution patterns of its region. This approach, the study indicates, could significantly improve Mumbai's air quality by tackling pollution from both inside and outside the city.

Mumbai's air quality worsens significantly during the winter months, driven by a combination of meteorological factors and pollution sources from both within and beyond the city limits. According to the World Air Quality Report 2023, Mumbai's PM2.5 levels rose by 23% in Jan 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, making it one of the worst-affected cities globally during the winter season.
Sarath Guttikunda, lead author of the study, said: ""Mumbai is a significant regional contributor to air pollution. While the city can gain considerable benefits from managing pollution within its immediate surroundings, this relationship is reciprocal; the surrounding satellite cities also stand to benefit greatly from efforts to control emissions originating in Mumbai. Coordinated management across Mumbai and its neighbouring areas could create a positive feedback loop, enhancing air quality and health outcomes for the entire Western airshed.""

The study identified 11 airsheds as crucial for overall air quality management, with the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and the plateau region between the Eastern and Western Ghats emerging as priority areas. The IGP alone, which accounts for 16% of India's landmass and 41% of its population, bears a high pollution burden due to extensive industrial activity, agriculture, and energy production.
""While regions like the IGP bear the brunt of industrial and agricultural pollution, contrary to popular belief, coastal cities like Mumbai have also witnessed a spike in pollution levels, particularly in winter, despite the benefits of land-sea breezes. In an urban regional airshed, the participating members would include a broad institutional setup, involving urban local bodies, state officials, ministries, and regional stakeholders. This larger collaboration is essential to addressing shared air quality issues in coastal cities like Mumbai,"" Guttikunda said.
The study concludes by recommending the establishment of a national system that integrates both regional and urban airsheds under a centralised air quality management framework.
""A centralised system would enable better coordination between cities, states, and airsheds, helping us monitor progress and ensure that everyone is working towards the same clean air goals,"" Guttikunda said. ""Air pollution isn't just an environmental challenge—it's a public health crisis. By creating a coordinated airshed approach, we can make significant progress in improving the air quality for cities and rural areas across India,"" he added."

MUMBAI: The winter season's pleasant chill was accompanied by concerning levels of air pollution in Mumbai. The atmospheric conditions, particularly the reduced wind speed characteristic of winter, created a perfect environment for pollutants to remain suspended in the air. The cooler air masses effectively trapped warmer air from the sea, leading to minimal air circulation and pollutant dispersal.
The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) monitoring network revealed troubling air quality readings across Mumbai's metropolitan region. The situation was particularly concerning as the city's overall Air Quality Index (AQI) reached 188, placing it firmly in the unsatisfactory category.
The most affected areas showing very poor air quality were Byculla and Colaba, with AQI readings exceeding 300. Following closely behind, several suburbs registered poor air quality readings between 200-300, including Chembur, Mazgaon, Sewri, Shivaji Nagar Mankhurd, and Siddharth Nagar Worli. These areas became hotspots of concern for local environmental authorities.
The pollution levels were also notably high in other parts of the city, with six additional suburbs recording AQI readings in the higher range of the unsatisfactory category (151-200). These included the Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), Borivali, Terminal 2 airport area, Kherwadi, Malad West, and Vasai West.

Health experts advised residents, particularly those with respiratory conditions, elderly individuals, and young children, to take necessary precautions. These included limiting outdoor activities during peak pollution hours, wearing appropriate masks when venturing outside, and ensuring proper ventilation indoors.
Local authorities monitored the situation closely and implemented various measures to control pollution levels. These included regular water sprinkling on construction sites, strict enforcement of dust control measures, and increased monitoring of industrial emissions.

The current weather pattern suggested that these conditions might persist until there was a significant change in wind patterns or temperature. Meteorologists closely tracked these parameters to predict potential improvements in air quality. Until then, residents were advised to stay updated with daily air quality forecasts and follow prescribed guidelines for their safety and well-being.
The situation highlighted the growing need for long-term solutions to address air pollution in urban areas, particularly during winter months when natural weather conditions exacerbate the problem. Municipal authorities were considering additional measures to improve air quality, including enhanced green coverage and stricter emission controls.

Even one hour of exposure to high levels of particulate pollutants, warn medical experts, can trigger immediate negative health impacts. When these particles enter the respiratory system, they can cause inflammation in the lungs, leading to reduced lung functionality and heightened airway resistance within a brief timeframe.
People with existing respiratory ailments, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), face heightened risks as exposure can worsen their condition and necessitate treatment. Studies indicate that short-term contact with these pollutants affects the cardiovascular system, causing elevated heart rate and blood pressure due to increased strain on the heart and blood vessels.

Prof Dr G C Khilnani, chairman, PSRI Institute of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, and a member of WHO's Technical Advisory Group on Global Air Pollution and Health, told TOI that five consecutive patients in his OPD who were earlier stable recently showed new symptoms, such as cough, sore throat, chest tightness, runny nose, breathlessness and wheezing for four-five days. Notably, they showed no signs of fever, and their condition did not improve with increased use of an inhaler or a nebuliser.


Dr Khilnani also observed patients with no prior respiratory conditions who sought treatment for cough and breathlessness during the previous week. Their X-ray results appeared normal, and spirometry tests showed no new alterations in lung function.
Dr Arvind Kumar, chairman, lung transplant, Medanta, said particulate pollutants enter the respiratory system, settle in the lungs and travel throughout the body, affecting various organs -- from the brain to the limbs. Children frequently develop breathing problems, persistent cough, allergies, asthma and pneumonia. Adults struggle with breathing difficulties, while the elderly are prone to pneumonia. The range of respiratory ailments is extensive, including increased instances of tuberculosis and lung cancer.

Air pollution is associated with 25% of heart attacks and there is an increase in early-onset hypertension and cardiac rhythm abnormalities, he added. The neurological effects include increased hyperactivity and reduced IQ levels in children. People exposed to pollution show higher occurrences of strokes.
Research indicates higher instances of dementia and Alzheimer's disease in pollution-exposed populations. Studies show exposure to polluted air is associated with nearly all known medical conditions, including liver and kidney disorders, fertility problems, diabetes, obesity and breast cancer.

Extended exposure to poor air with high concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 correlates with increased lung cancer risk. Dr Nikhil Modi, senior consultant, respiratory and critical care, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, said, ""Long-term inhalation of these fine particles contributes to carcinogenic processes within lung tissues due to their ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and enter systemic circulation.""
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) categorises outdoor air pollution as a Group 1 carcinogen, supported by substantial evidence linking it to lung cancer development.
Some elements in particulate matter, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals, are established carcinogens that increase cellular damage progressively. Research also indicates people residing in highly polluted areas show significantly higher lung cancer rates compared to those in less polluted regions.

Dr Nitin Rathi, senior consultant, pulmonology, Dharamshila Narayana Hospital, underlined the need to cut exposure to polluted air by staying indoors, particularly during poor air quality periods, and monitoring air quality indicators regularly. He suggested protective measures like air purifiers and N95 masks.
Dr Arunesh Kumar, senior consultant, respiratory medicine, Paras Health, said following prescribed treatments is vital for protection and recommended seeking prompt medical attention if symptoms develop.
Dr Gyandeep Mangal, principal consultant in pulmonology, interventional pulmonology and sleep medicine, Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute, said short-term exposure to pollution can be equally detrimental as long-term exposure. Healthcare centres are witnessing an increase in patients seeking care for asthma, COPD and cardiac arrhythmias.
The elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions are particularly vulnerable. Studies have shown several air pollutants contain carcinogenic properties. He recommended maintaining a balanced diet rich in antioxidants and proper hydration.

Gurgaon: The city's air quality took a turn for the worse on Tuesday, plunging into the ‘very poor' category after a gap of over three weeks and for the first time this month.
Gurgaon's average air quality index (AQI) scaled 358 on Tuesday, the highest since Nov 22, when it was recorded at 302 (also ‘very poor').
Meteorologists said this sudden downturn was because of calmer winds and lower temperatures, which allow pollutants to accumulate and remain suspended in the air.
Of the four monitoring stations in the city, just two — Teri Gram and Vikas Sadan — recorded AQI data on Tuesday. At Teri Gram, the average AQI was 356, and at Vikas Sadan, it was 397, almost in the ‘severe' zone.

""Calm winds at this time of year are typical and prevent pollutants from dispersing. The dip in temperature also plays a role, trapping particulate matter near the surface. With lower temperatures, instances of firewood burning and spot fires increase and add to pollution levels,"" said Sachin Panwar, an independent air quality expert.
TOI had reported last week that the first half of Dec this year was the cleanest since 2019, mostly because of brisk winds and higher-than-normal temperatures. Gurgaon's AQI has fluctuated between ‘moderate' and ‘poor' over most days of the month because of weather conditions.

Experts said on Tuesday that air quality is likely to remain ‘very poor' or at best, improve to ‘poor'.
""The predominant surface wind is likely to be from the northeast direction with a speed of less than 4 kmph during morning hours. Smog or moderate fog is likely in the morning, and wind speed will increase thereafter, becoming less than 6 kmph during the afternoon. The ventilation index lower than 6000 m²/s with an average wind speed of less than 10 kmph is unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants,"" according to central govt's System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar).
With air pollution going up, doctors raised alarms over the potential spike in respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses.
""Deteriorating AQI leads to health problems, particularly for those who have to travel and remain outdoors for work. I have seen five pneumonia cases today,"" said Kuldeep Kumar Grover, head of critical care and pulmonology at CK Birla Hospital, Gurgaon.

Five other areas—Chembur, Mazgaon, Sewri, Shivaji Nagar in Mankhurd and Siddharth Nagar in Worli—recorded an AQI between 200 and 300 (poor category). The city's average AQI was at 188, indicating moderate levels of pollution. Even moderate levels can cause breathing difficulties in people with lung/heart disease, children and older adults. Experts said the current atmospheric conditions, particularly reduced wind speed associated with winter, have created a perfect environment for pollutants to remain suspended in the air.

Delhi witnessed a sharp decline in air quality in the past 48 hours after winds turned calm and there was the formation of shallow to moderate fog. Central Pollution Control Board's data shows that AQI was 379, very poor, at 4pm on Monday, but it rose to 401 in the severe range at 10pm.
On Monday, Commission for Air Quality Management imposed measures under stage III of Graded Response Action Plan during the day. However, after AQI surpassed 400 in the night, stage IV was invoked with immediate effect.

It bans the entry of non-essential trucks running on non-cleaner fuel and stops construction activities in linear public projects such as highways, roads, flyovers, overbridges, power transmission and pipelines.
Experts said no improvement in the air quality was expected on Wednesday. ""As winds have slowed down since Monday, it is hampering the process of dispersion of pollutants. Due to a western disturbance, which is currently impacting northwest India, there has been a rise in humidity levels, leading to the formation of shallow to dense fog. Fog also traps pollutants,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of Skymet Meteorology.
Similar conditions are likely to persist on Wednesday, but the wind speed may rise on Thursday after the influence of the western disturbance is over, he added.
This Nov recorded eight severe days, including two severe-plus, when AQI crossed 450, and 22 very poor days. It also witnessed AQI reaching 494 on a scale of up to 500 on Nov 18, making it the second most polluted day ever. In comparison to Nov, the first fortnight of Dec was relatively better than the past year.
Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy at Centre for Science and Environment, said, ""We know from past experience that more pollution spikes happen during the second half of winter — after the crop burning season is over — due to the intensification of cold and calm conditions. This indicates high and elevated levels of pollution in the city and the region.""
Pointing out that the annual average and the winter average of PM2.5 levels took an upward curve last year, she emphasised that action must be ramped up to ensure Delhi continues to reduce the annual average level.

The ""disciplinary action"" came after CCTV footage showed that an elderly man was made to wait for over an hour without assistance and was being shuttled around departments for a simple property transfer applicant.
Despite sending instructions through a worker to address the elderly man's concerns at the earliest, the staff continued to ignore the visitor. After waiting a while, Lokesh M visited the section and asked the staff to stand up and work for the next 20 minutes.
The CEO then issued clear instructions that visitors must receive proper responses with specific timelines for resolution, ensuring respectful treatment and attentive service.

""This is not how a public service should function. We are here to help the public and resolve their problems,"" the CEO told TOI.
He added that the elderly visitor's property transfer issue wasn't complicated and could have been resolved promptly.
The Authority's administrative office in Sector 6 receives over 1,000 daily visitors seeking services across various departments and issues, such as residential plots, group housing, land, industry, civil, and public health. The ground floor houses clerks, assistant managers, and managers who handle most public interactions, while senior officials, including the CEO, operate from the first floor, where they meet visitors between 10am and noon.

To maintain oversight, the CEO said he had installed monitoring screens in his chamber that displayed feeds from CCTV cameras throughout the building's departments and public spaces.
Officials agreed there was a recent surge in visitor numbers following a policy change requiring both buyers and sellers to be present at the Sector 6 office for obtaining transfer memorandums (TMs) for property transactions, a departure from the previous system where only one party or representative was needed.
This isn't the first time Lokesh M has taken strict measures to improve the Authority's functioning. In Sept last year, he addressed the issue of chronic tardiness among senior officials after many were found arriving at least 30 minutes late, despite staying just 2km from office in Sector 14A.
The CEO issued a notice describing this behaviour as ""highly objectionable"", particularly when the chief minister was emphasising the importance of improving govt-public relations.
The official working hours at the Authority are 9.30am to 6pm, Monday through Friday.
However, additional CEOs, OSDs, heads of departments, and divisional officers were frequently arriving after 10am, causing inconvenience to the public and damaging the Authority's reputation.
The Authority has now implemented stricter monitoring systems and accountability measures to ensure that such incidents of public negligence do not recur, with clear warnings of disciplinary action against offenders.

Follow these tips,"Updated: Nov 26, 2024, 15:45 IST","Representative image
Pollution generates free radicals, which increase skin ageing, cause hyperpigmentation, and weaken the skin's barrier. Dr Swati Agarwal, dermatologist based in Delhi tells us, ""It can lead to clogged pores, acne, dryness, and irritation. Hair absorbs pollutants, leading to dullness, dryness, increased breakage, and even scalp issues. High AQI levels in Delhi intensify these effects, making skin and hair prone to inflammation and oxidative stress.""
For haircare
Use a deep-conditioning mask with argan oil or shea butter to restore moisture. Opt for scalp treatments with tea tree oil to combat irritation. Avoid overwashing your hair as that can strip the scalp of natural oils. Minimise the use of hot air dryers to prevent further damage to the hair and scalp. It is important to regularly consult a dermatologist to understand your skincare and haircare routine for this season.
Pollution can also affect the eyes causing dryness and redness. Place cucumber slices, rose water-soaked cotton pads or cold eye masks to relieve eyes from the pollution-induced irritation. Rose water can also be applied on the face to have the same cooling effect. Protect your nails too by gently massaging them
Dr Geeta Sajid Fazalbhoy, dermatologist based in Mumbai

For skincare
During the day, use a gentle cleanser with ingredients like aloe vera and green tea to clean your face. Then apply a moisturiser that suits your skin. Lastly, apply sunscreen of SPF 50+. At night, practice double cleansing. Apply a gentle serum and eye cream to help your skin heal from any potential damage. Do not overload your skin with different products. Use face masks when you step out.

USE THE RIGHT PRODUCTS
● Use products with gentle, hydrating, and antioxidant-rich formulations
● Avoid alcohol-based toners, exfoliants with harsh beads, and strong actives as they can further irritate the skin
● Avoid heavy, occlusive creams that trap pollutants
● Don’t use overly fragrant products as they can trigger sensitivity in cold, polluted air
Avoid highly exfoliating products, especially if purchased over the counter without addressing specific concerns or consulting a dermatologist. These products can cause side effects and worsen sensitivity in polluted cities like Mumbai and Delhi. Specifically, avoid products having Retinol, AHA (Alpha Hydroxy Acid), BHA (Beta Hydroxy Acid).
Dr Sagar Gujjar, Mumbai based dermatologist

EAT HEALTHY FOOD
Dr D M Mahajan, a dermatologist, says, “Consume foods rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and omega fatty acids. These include carrots, sweet potato, pumpkins, papaya, spinach, fruits, avocados, dark chocolate, broccoli, fishes, juices, and soups.” He adds, “Drinking enough water is also extremely essential to keep the skin hydrated and to maintain its humidity.”"

The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) warned that the air quality is likely to deteriorate further in the coming days. ""The predominant surface winds are likely to blow from southeast and at a speed of less than 4 kmph during morning hours. Smog and moderate fog are likely in the morning hours with a mainly clear sky and cold wave conditions are to persist at isolated places. The wind speed will increase thereafter, becoming less than 6 kmph from the northeast direction during the afternoon hours,"" Safar stated.

""Thermal inversion reduces the vertical mixing of pollutants, while stagnant winds limit their horizontal movement. This is why localised sources such as vehicular emissions, road dust, and garbage burning dominate the pollution mix during this period. Measures need to focus on curbing local sources immediately,"" said Sachin Panwar, an independent air quality expert.
The level of PM2.5 — a toxic particulate matter that enters the blood through the lungs — was the highest at Sector 51 at 420 µg/m³, nearly 28 times the permissible limit of 15 µg/m³ set by the World Health Organization (WHO).

With the onset of winters, the air quality in the capital has again worsened and has prompted the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to enforce Stage-III of the revised Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across the NCR. With the Air Quality Index (AQI) consistently in the ‘very poor’ category, the move comes as part of efforts to combat severe pollution levels caused by stagnant meteorological conditions, including calm winds and low mixing heights.
GRAP, a framework designed to counter air pollution, categorizes responses into four stages based on AQI severity. Stage-III is activated when AQI levels range between 401 and 450, signaling the need for stringent measures. As of December 13, CAQM has introduced revised restrictions under Stage-III to address the deteriorating air quality.
GRAPIII restrictions: What Delhi drivers need to know

One of the key measures includes a ban on inter-state buses entering Delhi, except for those operating on electric, CNG, or BS-VI diesel. This step aims to limit emissions from older diesel vehicles, which are significant contributors to the city’s pollution levels. Additionally, diesel-operated medium goods vehicles (MGVs) with BS-IV or older emission standards are barred from entering Delhi unless they are transporting essential goods.

These factors can take a toll on one’s reproductive health and result in challenges with conception. It is crucial to consult a fertility specialist to enhance the chances of conceiving successfully.
Air pollution is becoming an increasing concern. It not only affects your respiratory, eye, or skin health but also hurts your fertility. There’s a significant link between air pollution and infertility problems in males and females. Pollutants present in the air like particulate matter (PM), toxic chemicals, and heavy metals can take a heavy toll on the reproductive health of males and females. Long-term exposure to these pollutants can highly interfere with the woman’s hormones causing hormonal imbalance and irregular menses. Hormonal balance is crucial for regulating menstrual cycles and ovulation in women and imbalance can cause disruption. The chances of conceiving naturally decrease when the woman’s ovulation is delayed hurting their fertility. It does not just affect a woman’s menstrual cycles but also lowers the quality of the eggs. It can further lead to conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) which can have a severe impact on the woman’s fertility.
Air pollution is a serious threat that affects not only fertility in women but also in men. Some researchers highlight that long-term exposure to harmful pollutants such as vehicle emissions and industrial chemicals can have negative effects on men’s reproductive health. These environmental toxins can further lead to complications like reduced sperm count and impaired sperm motility making it challenging for the sperm to fertilize the egg for a successful pregnancy. It can also severely damage the DNA in the sperm. Recognizing and addressing these hidden dangers of air pollution becomes crucial to protecting your fertility.
It becomes necessary to follow proactive measures to significantly protect fertility in both men and women. It is advised to limit their exposure to high levels of pollution. Avoid traveling during peak traffic hours as the levels of air pollution will be higher during this hour. Always check the air quality index (AQI) before making any plans or going outdoors. In case, you are going outdoors then make sure that you carry a mask for maximum protection. One can try investing in a good air purifier as indoor air quality is as important as outdoor air quality. Lifestyle modifications like eating a healthy balanced diet, staying hydrated, avoiding smoking or alcohol, and exercising regularly can help safeguard your fertility. Going for regular health screenings or fertility checkups can be helpful especially if you are actively trying to conceive. Ensure that you stay in touch with your fertility doctor to effectively monitor your reproductive health.

As the air we breathe becomes increasingly toxic, it’s not just our lungs but our hearts that are paying the price. Forget cholesterol-laden meals or sedentary lifestyles for a moment; your daily exposure to polluted air may be doing more harm to your heart than you realize.
From bustling urban streets cloaked in smog to rural households filled with smoke from burning biomass, air pollution is silently infiltrating our bodies. Emerging studies reveal that the microscopic pollutants we inhale travel far beyond the lungs, triggering inflammation, oxidative stress, and even clogging blood vessels. It’s a wake-up call: the air around us isn’t just dirty; it’s deadly, with consequences that could shape the future of cardiovascular health.
Pollution is no longer merely an environmental issue; it has transformed into one of the most pressing public health challenges of our time. The figures are staggering—air pollution is responsible for millions of premature deaths globally, with cardiovascular diseases accounting for a large share. Microscopic particulate matter like PM2.5 and PM10, alongside harmful gases such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and ozone, penetrate deep into the body’s systems. Once inhaled, these pollutants wreak havoc by causing inflammation, oxidative stress, and narrowing of the blood vessels, all of which increase the risk of hypertension, strokes, heart attacks, and arrhythmias.

India’s situation is particularly alarming. Air pollution has been identified as the second leading risk factor for deaths in the country, trailing only poor diets. Nearly 40% of the population breathes air that fails to meet national safety standards. The health consequences are evident, as cardiovascular ailments linked to poor air quality have seen a steep rise. Rural areas, too, are not exempt, with biomass burning for cooking and heating adding significantly to indoor pollution levels.


The process by which pollution impacts the heart is multifaceted. Tiny particles from pollutants enter the bloodstream through the lungs, initiating a chain reaction of adverse effects. Chronic inflammation damages the endothelial lining of blood vessels, which can lead to the development of atherosclerosis, a condition that significantly raises the risk of heart disease. Furthermore, exposure to pollutants can cause sudden spikes in blood pressure and increase the likelihood of clot formation, both of which are precursors to life-threatening cardiovascular events like strokes and heart attacks.
Long-term exposure to polluted air also disrupts the autonomic nervous system, which regulates crucial functions such as heart rate and blood pressure. This imbalance often results in arrhythmias, a condition where the heart beats irregularly, sometimes with fatal consequences. Alarmingly, the risks are not confined to a specific demographic. While older adults and individuals with pre-existing heart conditions remain most vulnerable, children and pregnant women are also at considerable risk. For expectant mothers, prolonged exposure to polluted environments has been associated with complications such as pre-eclampsia and restricted fetal development.

Despite these grim realities, there is hope. Addressing the cardiovascular impact of pollution requires a concerted effort at individual, societal, and governmental levels. On a personal front, monitoring air quality indices and avoiding outdoor activities during high-pollution periods can reduce exposure. Using air purifiers at home and wearing protective masks when venturing outside are additional safeguards that can make a significant difference. Lifestyle modifications, including adopting antioxidant-rich diets and staying active in clean environments, can also help mitigate some of the health risks.
However, the solution must extend beyond individual actions. Comprehensive policy interventions are essential. Stricter enforcement of vehicle emission standards, promoting renewable energy sources, and urban greening initiatives are critical measures to improve air quality. In India, efforts to popularize electric vehicles and provide cleaner cooking fuels have shown promise but need to be scaled up substantially to counter the escalating crisis.
The time to act is now. Air pollution’s far-reaching consequences on heart health demand immediate attention and collective action. Every breath we take has a profound impact on our cardiovascular well-being, making clean air not just an environmental goal but a health imperative. For a nation like India, where healthcare resources are already under immense pressure, curbing pollution could prevent countless illnesses and save lives.
Heart health is often framed as an individual responsibility, centering on diet, exercise, and regular medical check-ups. While these factors are undeniably important, the growing evidence linking air quality to cardiovascular diseases calls for a shift in narrative. Clean air is as crucial to a healthy heart as any lifestyle modification. Recognizing this reality and prioritizing pollution control is not just an act of environmental stewardship but a commitment to safeguarding public health. It’s time to breathe easy and let our hearts beat strong.

7 ways schools can safeguard students from air pollution

Shift to Online Classes: During periods of hazardous air quality, schools can prioritize the health of students, especially younger ones, by transitioning to online learning. This ensures uninterrupted education while keeping students safe indoors. Teachers can adapt the curriculum for virtual platforms and provide engaging content to maintain student interest.
Use Air Purifiers: Installing high-efficiency air purifiers in classrooms and common areas helps filter out harmful particles like PM2.5 and PM10. Schools can also regularly clean air ducts and ventilation systems to ensure they function effectively. Monitoring indoor air quality with digital meters can help maintain safe levels for students and staff.

Mandatory Masks: Schools should mandate the use of N95 or equivalent masks that effectively filter out pollutants. Providing these masks at subsidized rates or distributing them to students who cannot afford them ensures equal protection. Teachers and staff can educate students on the correct usage and disposal of masks to maximize effectiveness.
Limit Outdoor Exposure: Outdoor activities like sports, physical education, and assemblies should be moved indoors when pollution levels spike. Instead, schools can organize indoor activities such as yoga, art and craft, storytelling, or board games. Additionally, installing covered walkways between buildings can further minimize students’ exposure when moving between classes.
Health Monitoring: Regular health check-ups can help identify early signs of pollution-related issues, such as coughing, wheezing, or fatigue. Schools can collaborate with healthcare professionals to conduct routine screenings and offer medical support to students with pre-existing respiratory conditions like asthma. A first-aid station equipped with oxygen cylinders and inhalers can provide immediate relief during emergencies.
Educate on Prevention: Workshops, seminars, and campaigns can raise awareness among students about the dangers of air pollution and how to mitigate its effects. Activities like poster-making, essay competitions, and eco-friendly initiatives, such as tree planting or waste segregation, can engage students in understanding their role in reducing pollution.
Promote a Healthy Lifestyle: Schools can issue advisories encouraging students to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, which helps flush out toxins from the body. Nutritionists can guide parents and students on including antioxidant-rich foods like fruits, nuts, and green vegetables in their diets to boost immunity. Encouraging daily hygiene practices, such as washing hands and face after outdoor exposure, can further minimize health risks.

Ejipura flyover median cleared of 2,350 tonnes of debris
Bengaluru: After two months of persistent followup and weeks of work by stakeholders, 2,350 tonne of construction debris and soil were cleared from the median below the under-construction Ejipura flyover.
The Bangalore Political Action Committee (B.PAC), a non partisan group of Bengalureans, which coordinated with BBMP and the flyover contractor in the endeavour, stated that 94 truckloads were used to clear approximately 2,350 tonnes of construction debris and soil and 91 auto-tipper for clearing garbage. Five trailers, carrying 130 construction barricades, were cleared and crash barricades are now being placed in the medians.
The clearing was done as part of B.PAC's ‘IRR Street: Standstill to Active' project with the intention to improve reliability of buses, walkability and road safety on the 7.5-km stretch of IRR, linking Indiranagar and Koramangala. Revathy Ashok, honorary trustee and CEO of BPAC, told TOI that for the past year, they have been working towards overall improvement of the stretch. ""For the past two months, we specifically focussed and followed through on the garbage issue,"" she said, adding: ""The debris and the scaffolding left on the road was cleared by the contractor as per the terms of the contract. Plastic waste was cleared by BBMP under the supervision of the marshals. We've been pursuing the issue on a daily basis, circulating photos, talking to their higher ups and thereby, putting enormous pressure on them.""

According to data by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Gurgaon's 24-hour air quality index (AQI) from Dec 1 to Dec 15 was calculated at an average of 196, or ‘poor' category, this year.
The month has not seen any ‘severe' air days so far. Instead, there were eight ‘moderate' days and seven ‘poor days'
In contrast, the average AQI for the same timeframe last year was 253 (‘very poor'). The month recorded 14 ‘poor' days and one ‘very poor' AQI day in 2023.

The last time that the average AQI was better in the first half of Dec was in 2018, when it was recorded at 128.
In 2016, when CPCB started keeping data for air quality in the city, the average AQI was 409, or ‘severe'. Dec that year saw nine ‘very poor' air days.
Shubhansh Tiwari, a research associate at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said the daily AQI figures don't show any monumental difference in air quality.

""It is just a marginal change when we see year-on-year data. It can be because Gurgaon's air might not be coming from the direction of an industrial belt like Delhi or areas where stubble burning is taking place this year,"" he said.
Tiwari said this Dec, wind speeds were higher, helping disperse pollutants suspended in the air. Data by the Met department shows the average wind speed was 12 kmph this month, compared to 6 kmph during the same period last year.
Similarly, Tiwari said, ""Temperatures dipped a little later this year. And, in the first week of Dec, the wind direction was southeasterly, which helped too.""
Unlike northwesterly winds, southwesterly winds typically don't bring in pollutants towards NCR region.
Every winter, a mix of cold weather and still winds allows pollutants to remain suspended in the air, creating a blanket of smog over Delhi-NCR.
This happens because of a phenomenon called ‘temperature inversion', when a layer of warm air traps cooler air close to the ground, preventing pollutants from rising and dispersing. Higher temperatures don't lead to the occurrence of this phenomenon.
Data by the Met department shows that the city's average minimum temperature in Dec 2024 was 8.2°C. For the same period last year, in Dec 2023, the average minimum temperature was 6.8°C.
""Cleaner air this year is primarily due to favourable meteorological conditions, not the result of on-ground efforts by govt agencies,"" said Manoj Kumar, air analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).
Forecasts say air quality is expected to worsen.
Wind speed, which is between 4-6 kmph, will decrease over the next three days and AQI is likely to be ‘poor' and ‘very poor', according to central govt's System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar).

Kolkata: As temperatures dip with the onset of winter, the city's air quality began to deteriorate, raising health concerns among residents. Four real-time Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS) recorded ‘poor' air quality (AQI: 201-300), while three other stations are nearing the transition from ‘moderate' (AQI: 101-200) to ‘poor', at a time when the national capital, Delhi, is grappling with ‘severe' air pollution levels.
West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB) officials attribute the worsening air quality to temperature inversion, a common winter phenomenon where cooler air near the ground gets trapped under a layer of warmer air, locking pollutants closer to the surface. This atmospheric condition hinders pollutant dispersion, leading to increased exposure for city residents.
""The combination of calm winds, clear skies and long nights slows down the dispersal of pollutants. The warm air above prevents the cooler air below from rising, effectively trapping pollution near the ground,"" said a WBPCB officer.
The primary pollutant affecting the city's air quality is fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which is small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream. WBPCB experts warn that prolonged exposure to high levels of PM2.5 can have severe health implications, including respiratory and cardiovascular issues.

""PM2.5 is the dominant pollutant and its count largely determines the air quality. The higher the PM2.5 levels, the more hazardous the air becomes,"" an official said.
Among the seven CAAQMS locations, Fort William recorded the poorest air quality, while Jadavpur emerged as the cleanest on Sunday. Salt Lake, Ballygunge and Victoria, too, were in ‘poor' zone. However, stations like Rabindra Bharati University (B T Road) and Rabindra Sarobar are showing rapid deterioration, moving towards the ‘poor' AQI category.

The city's pollution woes are compounded by its geographical location at the tail end of the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), one of the world's most polluted airsheds. Pollutants trapped in the valley during winter travel from north to south along the valley, affecting cities along the way.
Cities like Delhi, Gurgaon and Ghaziabad in the IGP are some of the world's most polluted. ""Kolkata, being at the southernmost end, bears the brunt of trans-boundary pollution. This underscores the need for mitigation at the airshed level rather than relying only on city-specific plans, which have inherent limitations,"" said WBPCB chairman Kalyan Rudra."

Vehicle emissions contain many toxic compounds, mainly carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, ozone, lead, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and particulate matter. Particulate matter is a complex mixture of microscopic particles and liquid droplets composed of all these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, metals, and dust particles. These particles are usually classified according to their size, they can be either PM 10 or PM 2.5 – these particles have diameters of 10 and 2.5 micrometers respectively. If you compare the size of PM 2.5 to a grain of sand or an erythrocyte, a red blood cell, they are 40 times and 3 times bigger than PM 2.5.
The nature of air pollution:
Among the main pollutants mentioned above, particulate matter is the most harmful to health due to its small size and characteristic of adsorbing other toxic agents on its surface. These particles can translocate almost all physiological barriers in the human body like the lungs, blood-brain barrier, dermal barrier, and maternal-fetal interface – the placenta.

Air quality is determined by the concentration of key pollutants measured daily. Among all these pollutants present in the complex mixture that constitutes air pollution, it is only known how carbon monoxide exerts its effect on the fetus. The mechanism by which other pollutants influence fetal development remains unclear. It is possible that either DNA damage or the other p450 enzymes' endocrine alterations are involved compromising the placenta function.

Air pollution during pregnancy can have various effects on the fetus, including an infant being small for gestational age or preterm births. These can also result from added associated risk factors like maternal smoking. There is a risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or abruption of the placenta in the mother. Air pollution can also contribute to intrauterine growth restriction. However, there is very little evidence to suggest how early exposure or the amount of exposure to the pollutants affects the fetus. Chronic exposure usually results in long-term health effects in individuals, which can manifest as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory disease, stroke, or cancer.
How pregnant women can mitigate air pollution?
Usually, we focus on 3 ways to reduce air pollution: Reduce, Recycle, and Reuse - which eventually results in sustainable living. At home, as expectant mothers, you can reduce air conditioning usage, which contributes to harmful emissions of gases, including chlorofluorocarbons depleting the ozone layer. Instead, they can use fans or improve their housing ventilation. Conserve energy by turning off the lights or unnecessary electric equipment either at home or work when not in use.
Regarding travel and transportation, you can telecommunicate to reduce driving or go for carpooling, biking, or walking. Plastic takes a longer time to decompose and emits most poisonous gases. Thus, avoid using plastic bags or woven bags, especially when you go shopping, and carry your own bags which can be reused. In addition, use cleaner fuels for vehicles or use electric vehicles if you need to commute regularly.
Take care of the environment by planting more trees and taking care of them. In the kitchen too, kitchen waste can be used for composting at their own home and used for gardening. This can be done by creating a pit around the house which can be used for wet waste. Ensure that they are not burnt because they will emit harmful gases if burned.
Educate the staff, including house helpers, drivers, or cook, on how to lead sustainable living. Teach them the art of reducing, recycling, and reusing so that everybody can contribute in a smaller way which will help in a larger outcome so that everyone becomes a champion of clean air. Therefore, it is time for greater involvement in the health sector to discuss public policies to improve the quality of the environment directly or indirectly and reduce the negative impact on the health of those who were not yet born.

The R-South ward issued a notice earlier in Jan this year, and the developer responded, claiming they were adhering to the guidelines. However, following a complaint, the site was inspected recently, and the BMC found that the site was not adhering to several pollution guidelines.
According to officials of the R-South ward, the site is an SRA construction site, and further action will be initiated if the developer fails to adhere to the anti-pollution guidelines. When the site was inspected by the BMC staff following a complaint recently, they found that the under-construction building was not covered with green cloth from all sides. The anti-smog gun was not permanently deployed at the site, the jet spray machine was not being used at regular intervals, and construction material and debris were not stacked in a properly barricaded area, resulting in air pollution.
Additionally, tin sheets were not erected around the periphery of the under-construction building at the site. Therefore, the R-South ward issued a speaking order to Nikunj Sanghavi, VD Infrastructure, Veena Smart Home. The R-South ward also directed the developer to take all precautionary measures to abate air pollution and comply with the observations before carrying out any further construction activity on site.
Activist Reji Abraham said, ""This site is next to the main road, and the residents have to deal with dust and sound pollution. Meanwhile, construction work continues unabated, despite the recent BMC speaking order and a letter by the civic body asking police to maintain vigil. This is just one such example in Charkop under the R-South ward. Charkop/Kandivli has recorded high AQI levels, but where do authorities care?""

The nine-year-old is among nearly two million students in and around New Delhi told to stay home after authorities once again ordered schools to shut because of worsening air pollution.
Now a weary annual ritual, keeping children at home and moving lessons online for days at a time during the peak of the smog crisis in winter ostensibly helps protect the health of the city's youth.
The policy impacts both the education and the broader well-being of schoolkids around the city -- much more so for children from poorer families like Gautam.

""I don't like online classes,"" she told AFP, sitting on a bedher family all share at night in their spartan one-room home in the city's west.
""I like going to school and playing outside but my mother says there is too much pollution and I must stay inside.""
Gautam struggles to follow the day's lesson, with the sound of her teacher's voice periodically halting as the connection drops out on the cheap Android phone.
Her parents both earn paltry incomes -- her polio-stricken father by working at a roadside food stall and her mother as a domestic worker.
Neither can afford to skip work and look after their only child, and they do not have the means to buy air purifiers or take other measures to shield themselves from the smog.
Gautam's confinement at home is an additional financial burden for her parents, who normally rely on a free-meal programme at her government-run school to keep her fed for lunch.
""When they are at school I don't have to worry about their studies or food. At home, they are hardly able to pay any attention,"" Gautam's mother Maya Devi told AFP.
""Why should our children suffer? They must find some solution.""
Delhi and the surrounding metropolitan area, home to more than 30 million people, consistently tops world rankings for air pollution.
The city is blanketed in acrid smog each winter, primarily blamed on agricultural burning by farmers to clear their fields for ploughing, as well as factories and traffic fumes.
Levels of PM2.5 -- dangerous cancer-causing microparticles that enter the bloodstream through the lungs -- surged 60 times past the World Health Organization's recommended daily maximum on Monday.
A study in the Lancet medical journal attributed 1.67 million premature deaths in India to air pollution in 2019.
Piecemeal government initiatives include partial restrictions on fossil fuel-powered transport and water trucks spraying mist to clear particulate matter from the air.
But none have succeeded in making a noticeable impact on a worsening public health crisis.
- 'A lot of disruptions' -
The foul air severely impacts children, with devastating effects on their health and development.
Scientific evidence shows children who breathe polluted air are at higher risk of developing acute respiratory infections, a report from the UN children's agency said in 2022.
A 2021 study published in the medical journal Lung India found nearly one in three school-aged children in the capital were afflicted by asthma and airflow obstruction.
Sunita Bhasin, director of the Swami Sivananda Memorial Institute school, told AFP that pollution-induced school closures had been steadily increasing over the years.
""It's easy for the government to give a blanket call to close the schools but... abrupt closure leads to a lot of disruptions,"" she said.
Bhasin said many of Delhi's children would anyway continue to breathe the same noxious air whether at school or home.
""There is no space for them in their homes, so they will go out on the streets and play.""

On Thursday, Delhi govt told the Supreme Court that it wanted to ban firecrackers permanently in Delhi. Though the pyrotechnics significantly impact the air quality in the winter months, their impact is less in the summer when pollutant dispersion is quicker.
Track the pollution level in your city

While the court has sought the views of the neighbouring states on Delhi's proposal to ban fireworks, experts pointed out that pollution levels can be significantly reduced even otherwise by acting on other sources of pollution, such as vehicular emissions, industries, construction and demolition, stubble burning and thermal power plants, which release more pollutants than fireworks.

Firecrackers release sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, particulate matter and toxic heavy metals like cadmium and lead. They contain other metals like copper, manganese, zinc, sodium, magnesium, and potassium in nitrate and nitrite forms. Monitoring of the air in Delhi during Diwali has noted a rise in pollution. Several studies in other countries have similarly established that firework emissions can cause air quality to deteriorate. In Beijing, a study of air pollution caused by a firework display during the Lantern Day Festival in 2006 reported more sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and PM10 pollutants in the air than the previous day.

Dipankar Saha, former head of the air laboratory at Central Pollution Control Board, said, ""Firecrackers need to be restricted as they suddenly increase emissions in the air, especially when it is at a standstill and there is little dilution and dispersion. Fireworks could be permitted under favourable meteorological conditions. We saw minimal impact of fireworks on pollution last Diwali because of increased wind speed that day.""
However, the problem with fireworks is not just that they release pollutants but also their dynamics. As Mukesh Khare, professor emeritus, IIT-Delhi explained, the firecrackers are a low-level emission source as they burst at surface level. ""The pollutants go a small distance into the air and fall down,"" Khare said. ""In the colder months, especially in north India, the wind velocity and temperatures are low and humidity is a bit higher. After a cracker is ignited, the explosive pollutants are emitted into the atmosphere, but as the surrounding temperature is low and winds are not fast, the pollutants don't travel far, either vertically or horizontally. Only people close to the burn site are exposed to the emissions.""
Khare, however, added that large-scale burning of fireworks means the pollutants are at boundary layer height and so unable to disperse due to meteorological conditions. ""The lower atmosphere gets affected by pollution,"" he pointed out. ""The contaminated air is inhaled into the lungs of people."" In summer, dispersion diminishes the adverse effect on air quality.
Though there is no apportionment study detailing firework's contribution in Delhi's air quality, experts said there are other more insidious pollution sources. Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst, Envirocatalysts, described a permanent ban on fireworks as a ""good symbolic step"" that will underline how anything that burns causes pollution. ""Delhi-NCR has other consistent pollution sources, which emit higher emissions throughout the year than firecrackers do,"" said Dahiya, who, therefore, wanted authorities to act against vehicular emissions, industrial, power plants, waste burning and construction dust with the same intent.
There is also the fact that chemical debris from fireworks contaminates the soil and groundwater and is harmful to animals and birds. A study done by an international team of scientists who tracked Arctic migratory geese in Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands spanning the New Year period, typically when crackers are burst, found the birds deserted their sleeping sites on hearing firework noise and never returned.
Chandra Bhushan, CEO, International Forum for Environment, Sustainability, and Technology, agreed with the destructive repercussions of fireworks, noting additionally that they cause fires that damage homes and properties.
So, while firework emissions appear hazardous, the chemical compounds the crackers contain also damage the soil and groundwater. However, banning fireworks and hoping it proves the solution to the city's choking air may be misconceived because there are pollutant sources that are more detrimental and about which no strong actions are proposed.

The irony is hard to miss. Indore, which has worn the crown of India's 'cleanest city' in government's Swachh rankings for seven straight years, has been struggling to clean up its air. The largest city in Madhya Pradesh has seen a 21% rise in levels of the pollutant PM10 between 2017-18 and 2023-24, according to recently released govt data.
Indore figured among 31 'non-attainment' cities - where air quality had deteriorated since the 2017-18 base year - in a list of 130 that are monitored under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), which aims to reduce PM10 levels in these urban centres by up to 40% by 2025-26.

While the list of 'non-attainment' cities includes places such as Navi Mumbai and Vizag, which also ranked high in the 2023 Swachh ratings, Indore's name stands out. It sees itself as a model city and has acquired an international reputation of sorts for cleaning up its act on sanitation and waste management, which form the basis of Swachh rankings. The city has been topping the Swachh Bharat surveys since 2016, but that's also roughly the period that NCAP has examined to find a deterioration in the city's air.

It's not hard to see why the city's air quality has been slipping. As the major commercial and industrial hub of the region, Indore has urbanised rapidly. A 2019 paper - Air Pollution Knowledge Assessments for 20 Indian Cities - published in Urban Climate found that the built-up area in Indore and its neighbourhood had grown about nine-fold between 1975 and 2014, the highest among the 20 cities the study looked at and more than double the average increase (4.2-fold) seen across these cities.

Indore has more than 3,000 micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) units. Over 500 real estate projects are under construction in the district, according to Credai. Revenue from property registrations in the city jumped to Rs 1,339 crore, up 7.2%, between April and Oct 2024 compared with the corresponding period last year, according to official data.
The city is also a major transport hub. Three national highways pass through Indore - NH 52 (part of the old Agra-Mumbai road), NH 47 (Nagpur-Bamanbore in Gujarat) and NH 347BG (within MP). Besides, two major state highways, SH 27 and SH 31, run close to the city. Indore itself has more than 20 lakh vehicles. Per the Regional Transport Office, around 8,000 two-wheelers and 2,500-3,000 cars are registered every month in the city.
""Traffic management has failed to keep pace with the rate of new vehicles hitting the roads. There are substantial emissions from congested traffic, including from vehicle tyres, which are particularly harmful,"" says city-based environmentalist O P Joshi.
Not surprisingly, the major contributor to Indore's pollution is the road dust kicked up by traffic movement. Vehicular emissions come second. Per a source-apportionment study by Clean Air Catalyst, a flagship programme launched by the US Agency for International Development and a global partnership of organisations led by World Resources Institute, road dust contributes nearly three-fourths of the city's coarse particulate matter (PM10), with transportation, industries, construction and household cooking making up most of the rest.
Road dust also leads in the share of fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) at 55%, followed by transportation, industries and household cooking.
This isn't very bad news for city authorities. Dust management is the low-hanging fruit among pollution-mitigation measures and doesn't involve harsh actions impacting people and livelihoods. ""Road dust gets resuspended in the air due to vehicular movement and wind. Continued optimal cleaning of roads would help minimise its impact,"" says Prakash Doraiswamy, senior scientist at Clean Air Catalyst and director of air quality at WRI.
Overall, too, Indore's location lends it certain natural advantages.
""Unlike the bowl-shaped Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) where calm winds and low temperatures lead to an accumulation of pollutants, Indore is a much windier place with an average wind speed of around 11kmph, which blows away a lot of pollution. Also, unlike the alluvial soil in IGP, the black soil in central India kicks up less dust,"" says Dipankar Saha, former head of Central Pollution Control Board's air laboratory division.
""Pristine air quality remains one of our focus areas. We are advocating large-scale plantation and utilising machinery to sweep roads to minimise dust. To curtail vehicular emissions, we are augmenting our public transport fleet with electric and CNG vehicles,"" says Indore divisional commissioner Deepak Singh.
If implemented well, these measures should make a dent in the city's PM levels. However, to bring pollution down to India's safe standards - 60 μg/m3 annually for PM10 and 40 μg/m3 for PM2.5 - Indore will have to do much more. A good place to begin would be data. The city recently increased the number of its air pollution monitors to seven. However, an analysis by Urban Emissions shows that the agglomeration of Indore, Dewas, Ujjain, Mhow and Pitampura needs a minimum of 26 monitors for particulate matter alone.
Only through granular data can Indore zero in on zones of high pollution to reach the level of sanitation in the air that the city seems to have achieved on the ground.

NCR schools to close under new guidelines: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has updated the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), making school closures mandatory in Delhi and key NCR districts during Stage 3 and Stage 4 air quality emergencies.
The revised guidelines are applicable to areas with severe air quality, including Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, and Gautam Buddh Nagar. Previously, the decision to implement such measures was left to state governments, but this change enforces uniformity in response to hasardous pollution levels.
Additional Measures Introduced Under Stage 3
As part of Stage 3 guidelines, state governments are now required to stagger the operating hours of public offices and municipal bodies in Delhi and nearby districts. However, for other NCR districts, decisions regarding office timings remain at the discretion of the respective state governments.

Changes for educational institutions

Previously, state governments had the option to halt physical classes for younger students under Stage 3 and extend online learning for higher grades under Stage 4. Under the revised plan, these measures are now compulsory for Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, and Gautam Buddh Nagar. Other NCR districts still retain flexibility in implementing school-related measures.
The revised GRAP guidelines highlight the need for proactive measures to combat air pollution. By mandating school closures and restructuring office operations, the CAQM aims to mitigate the risks posed by persistent smog and hasardous air conditions. However, the effectiveness of these measures will depend on consistent enforcement and inter-agency coordination.

Supreme Court intervention
The Supreme Court had earlier criticised the CAQM for delaying the implementation of strict measures under Stages 3 and 4 of GRAP. Highlighting the urgent need to protect children and residents from worsening air quality, the court directed immediate action, including school closures across NCR, until further orders.
Persistent severe air quality across NCR
Delhi’s air quality remains a serious concern, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) staying in the severe category. On Monday and Tuesday, AQI levels surpassed 450, reaching the ""Severe Plus"" category. By Wednesday, the 24-hour average AQI slightly improved to 419 but remained firmly within the severe range.
According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), areas such as Anand Vihar (406), Jahangirpuri (437), and Nehru Nagar (410) recorded severe AQI levels as of Thursday morning. The CPCB noted that this week’s pollution levels rank among the worst since the AQI system was introduced in 2015.

As per the Global Burden of Disease Study by Lancet estimated, approximately a fifth of the global burden of type 2 diabetes was attributable to PM2·5 exposure. With 99% of the global population residing in areas where air pollution levels are above current WHO air quality guidelines, and increasing concern in regard to the common drivers of air pollution and climate change, there is a compelling need to understand the connection between air pollution and diabetes.
The science behind the causality
Globally, an estimated 536 million adults have diabetes, either diagnosed or undiagnosed, a number that will increase to 783 million by 2045. Increased exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5) is associated with increases in blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) across the glycemic spectrum, including normoglycemia, prediabetes, and all forms of diabetes. With air pollution causing over 2 million deaths annually in India. The incidence of diabetes further intensifies the public health burden in India.
Who is most at risk?
While air pollution affects everyone, some groups are more vulnerable to its harmful effects. Individuals with existing health conditions, such as obesity or cardiovascular diseases, are at a higher risk. Emerging evidence suggests that prenatal exposure to air pollution may increase the risk of gestational diabetes, a condition that can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, children exposed to air pollution may be at a higher risk of developing type 1 diabetes, further emphasising the significance of early-life environmental exposures in diabetes. Moreover, people living in urban areas with high pollution levels and older adults are particularly susceptible. Subsequently, a risks analysis using data followed for a median of 10 years found that diabetes increased cumulative risk of cardiovascular death by 1.5-2.5% in both men and women.

Thick and severely harmful smog has been over the city for days, and the air quality has reached hazardous levels. As per sources, Gopal Rai, the Environment Minister of Delhi, has suggested using artificial rain, also known as cloud seeding, to help reduce pollution. The Delhi government is now asking for an urgent meeting with experts and government agencies to discuss whether this can be done as soon as possible.
How bad is the pollution in Delhi?

Delhi's air quality is worse than ever. The Air Quality Index (AQI) has crossed 450, which is in the “severe plus” category, meaning the air is unhealthy for everyone, according to recent reports and data presented by various online media sources. The pollution has been so bad that it’s hard to see the sky, and people are being warned to stay inside as much as possible. This is caused by various reasons, including the cold weather, which traps pollution in the air, the nearby parali (old crop) burning, as well as firecrackers. All of this has led to the city's dangerous smog.

Even though Delhi’s government has been trying to reduce pollution through actions like the Winter Action Plan and strict rules under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP-IV), the pollution is still getting worse. So now, the government is looking at more drastic measures to help clean the air.

What is artificial rain?
Cloud seeding, or artificial rain, is a method where chemicals are put into clouds to make them produce rain. These chemicals, like silver iodide, help the clouds form rain more easily, which then falls and eliminates the pollution from the air.

The idea behind using this in Delhi is that it could bring some immediate relief by reducing the amount of harmful particles in the air. While cloud seeding has been used in other parts of the world, especially in drought areas to increase rainfall, it’s a new idea in the situation of air pollution.
What are the risks of cloud seeding?

While artificial rain sounds like a good solution, it comes with some considerable risks. The chemicals used in cloud seeding could potentially harm the environment if they’re not used properly. There are also concerns about the long-term impact of using these chemicals on the environment and ecosystem.
Moreover, cloud seeding doesn’t solve the main problem. It might clean the air temporarily, but it won't stop pollution from coming back. The origins of Delhi’s air pollution are a lot of things like vehicle gasses, industrial emissions, and crop burning in nearby states. Cloud seeding can’t fix these issues on its own.
For people living in Delhi, the main concern is staying safe during these high pollution levels. Health experts recommend staying indoors as much as possible, wearing N95 masks when going outside, and using air purifiers at home. People with breathing problems should take extra care and seek medical advice if needed.
What’s next for Delhi?
Minister Gopal Rai has sent a letter to the Union Environment Minister, asking for an emergency meeting to discuss whether cloud seeding can be used to help clean the air in Delhi. This meeting will consist of experts and officials from various government agencies to decide on how and if it can and should be done."

Kolkata: The air quality index of two zones in the city turned poor, while the rest of the five zones covered by continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS) showed moderate air quality on Thursday.
Two stations – Ballygunge and Salt Lake - turned ‘poor' (AQI: 201-300). The other five zones – Fort William, Rabindra Bharati University (BT Road), Jadavpur, Rabindra Sarobar, and Victoria Memorial Hall stations showed a pale yellow colour band, representing moderate air quality.
Thanks to meteorological factors and some measures adopted by Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB), like sprinkling water to prevent road dust resuspension and preventing the burning of firewood and garbage, the pollution was stopped from blowing out of proportion in the city.
The city already started implementing the graded response action plan (GRAP) in the city and other five non-attainment cities in Bengal. The GRAP gets activated the moment the AQI rises over 200 (poor). Right now, GRAP is activated across Ballygunge and Salt Lake.

""The earth's surface has become cooler than the upper atmosphere. This phenomenon, known as thermal inversion, leaves pollutants hanging close to the ground at a breathable height, putting residents at greater risk. In other seasons, we might emit a similar amount of pollutants, but they escape high in the atmosphere because of the warmer earth surface,"" said a PCB scientist.
Stations like Jadavpur and Victoria are fast closing the gap between ‘moderate' and ‘poor'. Because of the thermal inversion in winter, the vertical wind speed lowers significantly, and the wind's ability to disperse pollutants reduces drastically, causing a spike in pollution.

Gurgaon: A thin layer of haze shrouded the city on Thursday after the air quality index (AQI) recorded at 260, sharply plunged into the ‘poor' category after a ‘moderate' AQI of 159 the previous day.
Experts attributed the deterioration to lower temperature which affects the effective dispersal of pollutants.
Of the four monitoring stations in the city, three reported ‘poor' AQI — 273 at Vikas Sadan, 250 at Sector 51, and 248 at Gwalpahari. This data was not recorded at Teri Gram.
The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) warned that air quality may worsen and reach the ‘very poor' zone over the coming days.

Varun, a cyclist at Kartavya Path, said, ""I have been staying in Delhi for the last 25 years, I have been cycling here regularly from last two to three years, the pollution increases during this period only, government focuses only on crackers but they are not the main reason behind this. The main reason is stubble burning in the nearby states.""
Another Delhi resident, Ankit Sachdeva, said, ""We pay taxes to the government for facilities but we have to fix this as well. Government needs to check pollution.""

According to SAFAR India data, several Delhi areas showed concerning air quality levels: Ashok Vihar (390), Dwarka Sector 8 (367), DTU (366), Jahangiripuri (417), Lodhi Road (313), Mundka (404), Najafgarh (355), and Narela (356).
The Central Pollution Control Board reported that Anand Vihar's Air Quality Index reached the severe category.
Various monitoring stations across Delhi displayed alarming AQI readings: Anand Vihar (403), Prataprganj (371), Pusa (320), RK Puram (365), Rohini (415), Shadipur (359), and Vivek Vihar (385).
The AQI classification system categorises readings between 200-300 as ""poor"", 301-400 as ""very poor"", 401-450 as ""severe"", whilst readings above 450 fall into the ""severe plus"" category.
The Supreme Court declared on Monday that having access to an environment free from pollution is a basic right guaranteed to all citizens under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasising that no religious practice advocates activities causing environmental degradation.
A bench comprising Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih expressed concern over the authorities' inability to enforce the firecracker ban in Delhi during Diwali. The justices highlighted that the uncontrolled bursting of firecrackers directly impacts citizens' fundamental right to maintain good health.
""The right to live in a pollution-free atmosphere is a fundamental right of every citizen, which is protected by Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Prima facie, we are of the view that no religion encourages any activity that creates pollution or compromises the health of people. If firecrackers are burnt in this fashion, it also affects the fundamental right to health of the citizens,"" said the bench."

Ranchi: The state capital is grappling with a severe spike in air pollution, with PM10 levels recorded well above permissible limits. On Thursday, Van Bhavan's Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station reported PM10 concentrations as high as 311.1 µg/m³ (micrograms per cubic metre), far exceeding the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) safety limit of 100 µg/m³. Despite slight improvement, readings on Friday showed early morning peaks of 285.44 µg/m³ and afternoon levels above safe thresholds at 107 µg/m³.
Rajiv Bakshi, secretary of the Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board (JSPCB), said, ""The air quality tends to be most hazardous in the early mornings due to temperature inversion, but it typically improves as the day progresses."" However, he emphasized the need for continuous monitoring and stricter controls to curb this recurring issue.
Navneet Shubham, a junior resident doctor at Rims, pointed out a worrying trend of rising respiratory cases, with 8 to 10 daily admissions for COPD and acute asthma exacerbations, underscoring the health impact of the deteriorating air quality.
According to AccuWeather, the Air Quality Index (AQI) for Ranchi remains in the ""Unhealthy"" category with an AQI of 103 recorded on Friday evening, indicating conditions that can affect even healthy individuals, while posing serious risks to vulnerable groups.

Lucknow: The burning of garbage in open areas, which is a major cause of air pollution, continues unchecked in various parts of the city.
A recent reality check showed instances of garbage burning in areas including Sitapur Road, Jankipuram, Daliganj Crossing and near Jhulelal Vatika, despite ban imposed by Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) in 2017, including a fine of Rs 5,000 on violators. The ban also mandated that one day's wage be deducted of the sanitary workers of the civic body if caught burning waste in the open.
Residents, however, claimed that the situation had remained unchanged. Daliganj resident Narendra Kashyap said, ""I tried several times to stop the sanitary workers from burning garbage in our area, but they ignored my complaints."" Electronics shop owner on Sitapur Road, Karamat Ali, said, ""It's not just the sanitary workers, residents too find it easier to dispose of waste by burning it. I filed numerous complaints, but when LMC didn't respond, I gave up.""
Municipal commissioner Inderjit acknowledged the issue but stressed that vehicular and industrial pollution were significant contributors to the city's air quality problem. He clarified, ""Our workers are sensitised and do not burn garbage, though there were some isolated incidents in which private sanitary employees were found burning trash. We will form teams to catch people who indulge in this activity and I will conduct raids personally.""

Experts warn of health risks associated with burning garbage. The smoke from burning garbage in the open is linked to respiratory issues, headaches, nasal congestion and nausea. Long-term exposure can lead to severe health conditions like lung disease, heart problems and liver ailments. Head of pulmonary critical care department at KGMU, Prof Ved Prakash, emphasised urgency of addressing the issue, stating, ""Given that Lucknow's air quality is poor throughout the year, immediate action is needed to curb the practice and protect citizens from long-term health problems, including heart failure, asthma and even lung cancer."""

For 140 days so far this year, the air quality of Bhopal has ranged between moderate and very poor categories. And for 10 days, the AQI crossed the 300 mark, placing it dangerously close to Delhi's pollution levels.
This means that for close to half a year the city's air was not fit to breathe. The air quality of Bhopal this year may have harmed residents' health in three ways: breathing discomfort to people with lung, asthma, and heart diseases and commorbidities; breathing issues to most people through prolonged exposure; and respiratory illness on prolonged exposure.
The AQI of Bhopal crossed the 300 mark and was rated in the very poor category for ten days this year. It also means that the city pollution levels are not that far off from that of the national capital, New Delhi. This year, only 63 days saw the AQI of the city rated as good, and for 111 days, it was rated as satisfactory.
Experts pointed out that air pollution increases during this time of the year not only due to firecrackers but also due to other factors.

Bonfires during winter lead to air pollution. Pollution levels decrease during monsoon but with no rains and rise afterward due to damaged roads and other activities make it worse.
Experts also noted that apart from local factors like people burning tyres and plastic during cold nights, which lead to increased pollution levels, weather also plays a role in air quality.
Meteorological department officials said that during this time of the year, winds from Punjab and Delhi blow over the state, which can cause the air quality index of MP cities to increase by up to 20 per cent. The second reason is that air pollutants come closer when the temperature falls. From the mid-troposphere, they descend to the low troposphere, leading to an increase in pollution.

Showers do wonders for air quality. The reason why air pollution decreases during rains, experts pointed out, is that dust becomes heavy in showers and does not fly in the air. Vehicular pollution also decreases as tyres do not cause pollutants and dust to fly in the air, as it settles on the ground. This is why pollution levels decrease during the monsoon.
Officials said that apart from the damaged roads, flying dust from vehicles and increased construction activities after showers lead to an increase in pollution levels.
Air quality is measured by taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), RSPM10, and PM2.5. Of the four, officials said, . PM10 is due to dust and construction, including that of roads while PM2.5, which is the most harmful, and is caused due to dust, human activity, and climatic conditions."

With civic authorities paralysed and unable to do anything to prevent a dome of toxic air covering the city, and the weather playing spoilsport in washing or carrying away the pollutants, technology seems like the last resort. TOI looks at the functioning of devices like air purifiers and tries to understand why even this costly assistive appliance may not fully meet people's needs.
Track the pollution level in your city
While hesitantly calling it a temporary solution, experts caution against the prolonged use of air purifiers, which require them to be used in enclosed spaces, pointing out how carbon dioxide levels could make indoor environments dangerous for health. According to Priyanka Kulshreshtha, co-founder, Society for Indoor Environment, while the capacity of an air purifier matters as some devices cater to smaller areas while others cover more, there is constant leakage of air through locked doors or windows. She said if a room is well sealed, the air purifier will manage the PM2.5 by trapping it in pre-filters, HEPA filters and activated carbon filters, but it does not address the CO2 problem.
Kulshreshtha said CO2 concentration is around 400 parts per million (ppm) outdoors and 1,100 indoors. However, while sleeping in a closed room, the gas can reach concentrations of 2000-2500 ppm, which can prove harmful. ""We are emitters of CO2. In a sleep lasting eight hours, our exhalation can raise CO2 concentration to up to 2500 ppm, irrespective of whether an air purifier is installed or not,"" she said. She also cautioned against everyone using air purifiers. ""For sick people, the device is recommended,"" Kulshreshtha said, ""but if a child gets accustomed to an air purifier and then goes outdoors, either to go to school or to play, the exposure to unfiltered air would be extreme."" She suggested ensuring ventilation in a room, but not opening windows early morning or late evening, or wearing an N95 mask.

According to Shambhavi Shukla of the Centre for Science and Environment, purifiers aren't efficient because as soon as a locked room is opened, the pollution shoots up. ""Air filters function when you close a room completely. But one cannot be inside a closed room for a whole day. Besides, even a slight crack or short opening of the door would send the impure air in the room shooting up again,"" said Shukla. However, given the dire air situation at the moment, experts suggested the use of ventilators while ventilating the room from time to time. This would make their use less harmful.

Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst, Envirocatalyst, said in any case only a fraction of Indian population could afford air purifiers and most Indian homes weren't designed for such devices. ""A majority of people live in houses that aren't sealed or isolated from the outside, which means outdoor polluted air will keep entering, reducing the usefulness of air purifiers. And staying indoors can take a toll on mental health,"" he said. ""Purifiers can't shield us from high pollution levels. They only give us temporary relief, that too for a very limited population who can afford the device or have houses that are sealed properly,"" said Dahiya.

Lahore, which has been ranked as the world's most polluted city by Swiss air quality monitor IQAir, recently recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of over 600, significantly lower than the alarming 1,900 it reached earlier in the month. For context, an AQI between 0-50 is considered 'good'.
The worsening air quality has led to a sharp increase in cases of respiratory diseases, eye irritation, and conjunctivitis in districts like Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, and Gujranwala.

The Punjab government noted an unprecedented rise in patients suffering from these conditions, attributing the spread of pink eye disease to dust, smoke, and chemical exposure.
As part of the new restrictions, outdoor sports events, exhibitions, and festivals have been prohibited, while essential religious activities remain exempt. Pharmacies, dairy shops, and vegetable outlets are allowed to operate until 8 pm (local time).

The pollution crisis has been particularly severe in Lahore, where thick smog has caused reduced visibility, leading to road accidents. In one incident, nine people were injured on GT Road when a van collided with a parked truck due to the dense haze.
Authorities in Multan are facing even more critical conditions, with the AQI reaching over 2,000 last Friday. The concentration of PM2.5 particles, a harmful pollutant known to cause severe respiratory issues, was recorded at 947 micrograms per cubic meter, which is nearly 190 times higher than World Health Organization guidelines.
Critics have pointed out that the government has been slow to enforce preventive measures, with many residents seen without masks despite the hazardous air quality.
Authorities have blamed cross-border winds from India for exacerbating the smog, claiming that pollutants drifting from across the border have worsened the air quality in Pakistan’s Punjab province. The Punjab government has expressed its intention to take up the issue with Indian authorities through diplomatic channels."

This year compared with 2022, the IPD numbers are 494 cases in 2024. With six weeks of the poorest period of air quality of the year yet to come, the number is expected to double in two years. Doctors suggest that the poor air quality and pollution is leading to asthma and bronchitis cases among the newborns and elderly in the city.
Breathless in Bhopal? GMC sees surge in patients
The fog of despair is getting worse each year affecting our lungs in the state capital. Comparing the air quality to other metropolitan cities and suggesting Bhopal's air quality is superior is misleading.

Gandhi Medical College's Hamidia hospital has recorded a significant increase in hospitalisation due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This information should encourage policy makers to address air pollution seriously and not wait for severe conditions like those experienced in Delhi.
The data pertains specifically to COPD IPD at one of the largest tertiary care hospitals in Bhopal. IPD hospitalisations for COPD, were approximately 340 (in 2022) which increased by 21% or to 434 (in 2023). This year, compared with 2022, the IPD numbers are whopping 494 cases in 2024. With six weeks of poorest period of air quality of the year yet to come, the number of is expected to double in two years.
Bhopal experiences worsened air quality during the peak winter months of October to February due to a combination of factors. These factors include stubble burning, reduced wind speed and colder temperatures, all contributing to air pollution which intern increases COPD distress, said GMC department of respiratory medicine, associate professor, Dr Vikas Mishra.
Dr Mishra explains how poor air quality is negatively impacting people's health in two distinct ways. The most severe impact is on people with existing respiratory illnesses. ""In short stable patients become unstable and need higher dose of medication and hospitalisation or both. Even in otherwise healthy people, poor air quality is causing viral infections to linger for longer periods of time,"" he added.
World COPD Day is observed every year on the third Wednesday of November, which falls on Nov 20 this year. The 2024 theme, ""Know Your Lung Function,"" highlights the importance of spirometry testing for diagnosing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and evaluating lung health.
COPD is more common in low-resource settings, where exposure to risk factors like tobacco smoke and pollution is often not controlled. Most of the cases are owing to worsening air quality, said Dr Mishra. However, experts do also point out that Bhopal has a significant higher COPD rate owing continuing environmental and health impact of the MiC gas leak of 1984."

The primary pollutant, particulate matter (PM) 2.5, rose alarmingly to over 250 µg/m³ in some places — nearly 50 times the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended safe level of 5 µg/m³.
Key areas such as Sanath Nagar, Gachibowli, the Old City, Malakpet and Kompally bear the brunt of this pollution spike.
The second major pollutant, PM10, also recorded dangerous levels, exceeding 200 µg/m³ in areas such as Somajiguda, Kompally and Kokapet. These levels are almost 18 times higher than the WHO's recommended limit of 15 µg/m³.

Explaining the phenomenon, Padmaja K, a professor and air pollution expert from the city, said: ""In winter, the ground cools rapidly at night, trapping cooler air near the surface under a warmer layer. This prevents pollutants from spreading upwards. Weaker winter winds further slow the dispersal of pollutants, allowing them to accumulate. However, the winter season only exacerbates the city's ongoing air pollution problems.""
She emphasised the need to address long-standing sources of pollution such as vehicle emissions, construction dust, waste burning and industrial waste, which also contribute to the decline in cold wave days.
Meanwhile, doctors in the city have reported an increase in pollution-related health problems, with children the most vulnerable. ""Children's lungs are still developing, making them more susceptible to damage from pollutants. Exposure to these harmful particles weakens their immune systems, increasing the risk of respiratory infections such as pneumonia and bronchitis. PM2.5 particles penetrate deep into the lungs, causing inflammation and reducing lung function,"" added pulmonologist Dr Tejas Jogi."

Not just asthma, bad air is increasing the risk of heart attacks, stroke and even high BMI in children. Dr Sundeep Salvi, Pune-based pulmonologist and head of the Indian Chest Society, speaks to Malathy Iyer about air pollution’s link to diseases and how we can protect ourselves

Why is air pollution described as a slow killer?
Air is a vital nutrient as we get 90% of our energy from it. One breathes around 10,000 litres of air every day. Our lungs, if spread out as a flat surface, would be like a 100-sqm tennis court. They are designed for clean air (comprising nitrogen, oxygen, argon and a little carbon dioxide) but instead encounter harmful elements such as nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, ozone and microscopic particulate matter (PM), which eventually get absorbed into our bloodstream. Over time, PM2.5 (2.5 microns in size) get deposited in various organs, increasing the risk of respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological complications. We blame sudden heart attacks and strokes on what we eat and lack of exercise, but air pollution plays a crucial role as well.

How widespread is air pollution in India?
Around 98% of Indians live in areas where air pollution levels are higher than WHO standards. While Delhi gets a bad name as one of the most polluted cities in the world, there are 15 to 16 Indian cities, including Mumbai, that are equally bad. Most of these cities are in the northern belt.
Are Diwali firecrackers the only reason for the worsening air quality?
Certainly not. Day-to-day activities like driving, construction work and burning of waste, among others, contribute significantly to air pollutants. Diwali fireworks further deteriorate the situation as the festival coincides with winter’s onset, when denser air causes pollutants to remain suspended at ground level for longer durations. Over the years, the number of patients visiting doctors with respiratory problems in Delhi has increased two- to three-fold immediately after Diwali.
One of your studies published in Lung India journal says prolonged exposure to high levels of outdoor air pollution could increase BMI among urban adolescents. Can we link air pollution to obesity?
The study — jointly done by the Pulmocare Research and Education Foundation in Pune, and Lung Care Foundation and CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology from Delhi in 2021 — looked at over 4,000 children from 12 private schools in Delhi, Mysore and Kottayam. We found a higher prevalence of asthma among adolescents in Delhi (30%) than among those in the relatively cleaner cities of Kottayam and Mysore (18%). Also, Delhi’s students were significantly more overweight. We believe air pollutants can directly lead to asthma by damaging the lungs or acting as obesogens (endocrine-disrupters) that affect the body’s normal processes and lead to obesity, which affects the physiology in such a way that it causes asthma.
What can people do to protect themselves from air pollution?
Just like the Covid-19 awareness drives about wearing a mask, we need to bring about a similar behavioural change for air pollution. We must wear a mask to protect ourselves from the polluted air outside. Research has shown that two layers of cotton with a chiffon or silk layer in between is as good as an N95 mask. Schoolchildren, motorcyclists, hawkers, autorickshaw drivers and others constantly on the road should wear a mask. Just as we brush our teeth twice a day, we should do nasal washes twice a day. One needs to improve hydration and provide the body with antioxidants found in fresh fruits and green vegetables. Exercises should be done when pollution levels are low, and we could put up indoor air plants that absorb pollutants."

One user remarked, “Interstellar should have been filmed here instead of using effects,” while another quipped, “Hollywood doesn’t need filters in India; this is just how it looks.” Some users even compared the scene to the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
Amid speculation that the photo was edited, the original poster clarified, “Since many of you are asking whether any filter is used while capturing this image? The answer is - No.” He also noted that similar visuals were visible in other videos from Noida.

Delhi’s air pollution crisis deepens

Delhi’s air quality reached 'severe plus' levels on Tuesday, with PM2.5 pollutant levels reported to be 60 times higher than the World Health Organization's recommended daily limit. The average Air Quality Index (AQI) for the day was recorded at 488.
In response to the crisis, the Supreme Court directed all NCR states to enforce Stage 4 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), even if the AQI falls below 400. Both state and central governments were ordered to file compliance reports on the implementation.
Schools, excluding grades 10 and 12, have shifted to online classes due to the worsening air. Experts cite smoke from firecrackers and stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana as major contributors to the hazardous conditions. The dire situation continues to raise concerns about public health, with reports equating exposure to Delhi’s toxic air to smoking nearly 49 cigarettes a day.

NASA’s Fire map shows widespread farm fires across North India

NASA's Fire map paints a grim picture of widespread farm fires, particularly concentrated in Punjab. Using data from its Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS), NASA offers high-resolution fire data at 375 metres, allowing for more accurate detection of active fires. The fires, primarily linked to stubble burning, are contributing to the region’s deteriorating air quality.

Supreme Court orders action on Delhi-NCR air quality

In response to the crisis, the Supreme Court directed all NCR states to enforce Stage 4 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), even if the AQI falls below 400. Both state and central governments were ordered to file compliance reports on the implementation. The Court noted that ISRO’s reliance on data from NASA satellites, which only pass over the NCR region between 10:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. daily, limits the collection of fire data to this narrow window.

To improve the situation, the Court instructed the Centre and the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) to collect farm fire data from geostationary satellites, which can provide continuous coverage, as opposed to relying solely on NASA’s polar-orbiting satellites.
Amicus curiae, Senior Advocate Aprajit Singh, highlighted that a Korean geostationary satellite captured data on farm fires at 4:20 p.m., suggesting the need for data from similar geostationary sources to ensure more timely action. The Court instructed authorities to immediately arrange for data from this satellite or similar sources to enable better management of the farm fire crisis.
Haryana reports significant decrease in stubble burning cases

On the ground, Haryana reported 36 cases of stubble burning on Monday, the highest since October 31. However, compared to the same period last year, which saw 2,052 cases, the numbers have significantly decreased this year.
This growing air pollution crisis underscores the urgent need for enhanced satellite data collection and timely interventions to protect public health and ensure air quality improvement in the region.

Some have become accustomed to the new setup, but some teachers argue that the experience of in-person learning cannot be replicated in an online environment. Some schools are also struggling with infrastructure problems.
""Each class is conducted by a teacher, with a second teacher acting as a controller to ensure that the camera is on, students remain engaged, and their posture is correct, among other things. Our infrastructure is equipped to ensure that classes run smoothly,"" Ameeta Mohan, principal of Amity International School in Pushp Vihar, said.

Mohan, however, acknowledged that online learning cannot fully replace in-person interactions. ""We strive to make the online experience enriching for students by using various learning tools, such as Pear Deck and Word Wall,"" she said. ""Teachers are attentive and ensure that every student participates by answering questions when prompted. We encourage peer learning in the virtual setting. One of the main challenges, however, is the increased screen time and the distractions that come with a home environment.""

A teacher at DPS, RK Puram, noted that infrastructure was not an issue as every student has access to a phone, tablet or laptop. ""However, to prevent students from relying on AI or other tools to answer questions during online classes, we make it a point to randomly select students and ask questions by name. This method ensures that they stay engaged and attentive throughout the lesson,"" she said.
Rooma Pathak, the principal of MM Public School in Pitampura, too emphasised that in-person learning cannot be fully replicated in a virtual setting. ""When students attend school in person, they not only engage in academic lessons but also participate in activities like library sessions, computer classes and co-curricular programmes. This provides a more holistic approach to their development. In the online format, we are limited to covering only the theoretical aspects of the syllabus,"" she said.
There are concerns about why teachers, as well as students in classes X and XII, are still required to attend school and expose themselves to the polluted air. ""Students in classes X and XII are expected to be in school every day, along with the teachers. I'm concerned about how the exposure to pollution could impact them. The problem of pollution needs to be nipped in the bud. It is not like Covid, which was unpredictable. Something needs to be done about it,"" Pathak said.
The situation in govt schools is quite different. The institutions and their students often lack the necessary digital resources. ""Only a handful of students have laptops, and many don't have access to phones or internet connectivity. Often, students and their parents struggle with technical issues and are unable to connect to classes, leading to a loss of interest over time,"" Sunita, the principal of Ravi Shankar SKV in Bawana, said.
Joginder Kumar, the principal of Government Co-Ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini, said that some classes are conducted in the evening. ""Many students don't have laptops or phones and rely on their parents' devices. As a result, we sometimes have to schedule classes late in the evening based on the availability of these devices,"" he said.
Geeta, a cook in Mayur Vihar, said she has stopped taking her phone to work as ""my child can use it for her online classes. After she's done, my elder son uses it for his lessons. I'm without a phone during work hours.... I can't be reached by residents.""
Parents are also in a dilemma. ""My son is in KG. With primary schoolchildren, one parent must sit with them during classes. This means I'm unable to focus on household chores for three hours every day. My child often gets distracted by the other activities around the house,"" said Mousumi Bhattacharya.
Although online learning is a response to current challenges, it is a temporary substitute for a holistic, interactive experience, underscoring the need for long-term solutions for reducing pollution and educational accessibility."

The city's air pollution sank to the ‘poor' category on Tuesday, registering a reading of 237 at 11am. By noon, it rose to 240. It improved slightly to 231 at 4pm.
The average air quality index (AQI) at 4 pm on Monday was 186. The Met department has predicted smog formation on Wednesday morning and evening, which suggests a further decline in Delhi's air quality.
Experts said that the air quality improved to moderate levels on Monday because of extensive rain in Delhi's surrounding regions, including some parts of Haryana. Temperatures are also expected to dip in the coming two days, with some isolated areas facing cold-wave conditions.

On Tuesday, the average air quality index (AQI), on a scale of 0 to 500, was 234.
According to the weather analysts, the city on Tuesday saw wind speeds reaching up to 16 kmph. However, a slight variation in the direction and dropping temperatures led to a slight deterioration.
Despite the deterioration, only one area of the city slipped into ‘very poor' air quality.
According to the IITM's decision support system, on Tuesday, the transport sector turned out to be the worst polluter in the city. It contributed to 12.1% of the pollutants, followed by 6.7% from industrial emissions and 3.4% from the residential sector. When factors beyond the geographical limits of Delhi were considered, Ghaziabad turned out to be the highest contributor of emissions at 13.5%, followed by Baghpat at 12.8% and Gautam Budh Nagar at 6%.
The IITM's decision support system expects the emission from transport to spike to 20% by Wednesday.
IITM's advanced air quality forecast has said: ""The air quality is likely to be in the ‘poor' category from Dec 11 to Dec 13."" The outlook for the subsequent six days also shows that the air quality is likely to be ""in the ‘poor' category"".
It added that on Wednesday, the city may see north-west winds up to 8 kmph in the morning along with smog or mist. The wind speed will increase to 10 kmph by the afternoon and then drop to 8 kmph again by the evening.
On Tuesday, the city recorded a maximum temperature of 23 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal, and a minimum temperature of 8 degrees Celsius, also two notches below normal.
The maximum and minimum temperature on Wednesday are likely to hover around 23 and 7 degrees Celsius. However, by Thursday, the minimum temperature may drop to 6 degrees Celsius.

The deteriorating air quality has led to widespread health concerns across age groups. Many in the city are facing difficulty in breathing, apart from eye irritation, throat discomfort, headaches, exhaustion and skin problems due to the contaminated atmosphere.
A 53-year-old resident of Nirvana in Sector-50 said he has been facing breathing difficulties during this time of the year for three years now. ""I use a nebuliser. I feel weak and sluggish constantly, have cough, difficulty in breathing and itching and burning in the eyes,"" Komal Rawat said.

Sachin Nanda, who is in his 60s and is suffering from a heart disease, experienced sudden chest pain and was brought to Shivam Hospital on Monday. ""He has not been able to sleep for two days. He was on sleeping pills. He was coughing all night and was having difficulty in breathing,"" said Nita, 58, Sachin's wife. Doctors have prescribed Sachin an inhaler.

Dr Sunil Sekhri, associate consultant - internal medicine, Max Hospital, said, ""Sore throat, burning eyes, and dry cough are very common complaints these days due to the rising levels of pollution in the city. People should stay indoors as much as possible, turn on their ACs and use a good-quality air purifier. If one has to go out, they should wear a mask. Avoid early morning walks and opt for gym instead.""
Doctors also advised people to wear goggles along with N95 masks. ""Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), an eye irritant, is produced by the photochemical smog and results in irritation and inflammation of eyes and possible conjunctivitis.

Emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, oil or wood produce much of the PM2.5 pollution found in outdoor air.
Environment experts say that although annual average PM2.5 concentrations might appear lower, they increase by five or six times in the winter months, reaching extremely unsafe levels and significantly impacting public health.

The Union govt stated that air quality monitoring in terms of PM2.5 levels is being conducted in 454 cities, out of which 246 cities met the NAAQS for the annual average of PM2.5 levels in the year 2023.
""PM2.5 concentration is not solely industrial pollution. Cities like Ahmedabad have registered PM2.5 levels as high as 300 in the winter months. Emissions from building construction and traffic are very high in cities like Ahmedabad. To make matters worse, the green cover has been depleting,"" said environmentalist Mahesh Pandya, convener of the city-based NGO Paryavaran Mitra.

‘Difficult to find depot land in MMR’
Amidst concerns raised by environmental groups on tree cutting, officials say identifying land for Metro depots in MMR is challenging due to space constraints.
The Mira-Bhayander Municipal Corporation (MBMC) has issued a public notice on tree removal for the Metro 9 depot, inviting objections and suggestions. The notice urges citizens to report if any of the trees have bird nests. The notice has drawn criticism for lacking details such as the species, height and age of the trees.
Originally, the depot was planned on a 13-hectare site across Morva, Raimurdhe and Murdhe villages. But villagers opposed the project, citing the displacement of 547 families and the construction of a 100ft road through the area. This prompted officials to shift the location to Dongri on an area that is part of a govt land parcel.

Guwahati: Suspended dust particles and particulate matter from extensive ongoing construction activities, coupled with sand bars formed in the Brahmaputra during the arid season and vehicular emissions, caused the air quality in Guwahati and Nalbari to deteriorate substantially in the past two days.
According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), air quality in both Guwahati and Nalbari progressively deteriorated since Dec 1 from ‘satisfactory' and descended to ‘poor' on Saturday and Sunday. Nalbari is situated over 80 km away from the state's capital, Dispur, in Guwahati.
Additional chief environmental scientist of the Assam Pollution Control Board, Gautam Kumar Mishra, indicated that PM10 emerged as the dominant pollutant in the atmosphere in the last two days. However, he noted that PM10 is less hazardous to human health than PM2.5.
PM10 represents particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometres or less. PM10 particles are minute enough to penetrate the lungs through the nose and throat and can cause severe health implications.

PM2.5 comprises air pollution particles that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter. These particles can be a mixture of smoke, soot, liquid or solid particles, mould, bacteria, pollen and animal dander. PM2.5 is particularly harmful to human health as it can be inhaled and traverse deep into the lungs. Health implications include heart or lung disease, acute and chronic bronchitis, asthma attacks and respiratory symptoms.

The scientist explained that the arid season persists from Nov to Apr in the state, and during this period, the dust concentration (PM10 concentration) in ambient air remains elevated above the threshold but diminishes once monsoon commences in May and continues to remain minimal till Oct.
He added that the extensive construction activities across the metropolis have become a significant source of pollution, while the formation of sand bars in the Brahmaputra during every winter is a crucial factor, contributing substantially to dust particles in the ambient air.
Additionally, the scientist indicated that the surge in vehicle against the rapid depletion of tree cover and deforestation are other factors behind the deteriorating air quality.
Mishra emphasised the significance of wetlands in combating air pollution. ""Wetlands absorb the particles in the ambient air. Unfortunately, a gradual reduction in wetlands can be observed over the decades,"" he said, adding that Nalbari in lower Assam has very few water bodies.
According to the ministry of road transport and highways data, 14.71 lakh vehicles are registered in Guwahati, while 1.64 lakh vehicles are registered in Nalbari.
The scientist further indicated that open incineration of municipal refuse, though reduced compared to previous years, is a key factor behind degraded air quality in Nalbari.
Guwahati has four operational air quality monitoring stations situated inside the State Pollution Control Board premises, Cotton University premises, IIT Guwahati premises and LGBI Airport.
Mishra added that the data recorded in the automatic air quality monitoring stations are accessible and published on the website. However, he indicated that the data recorded in the manual stations are yet to be collated and scrutinised and requires several days.

The forecast indicates moderate to dense fog with smog during morning and evening hours on Monday. IITM's early warning system suggests improving air quality to 'poor' levels by Monday due to increasing wind speeds.
Both maximum and minimum temperatures remained below normal on Sunday. IMD predicts a further 1-2 degrees Celsius reduction from Tuesday. Analysts suggest some Delhi areas might experience cold-wave conditions due to recent Himalayan snowfall and north-westerly winds bringing cold air from the mountains.

The capital registered 7.4 degrees Celsius on Sunday, two degrees below normal and slightly higher than Saturday's season-lowest of 7.1 degrees Celsius. IMD forecasts approximately 8 degrees Celsius for Monday, dropping to around 6 degrees Celsius from Tuesday through Thursday.
""Delhi saw light winds on Saturday with variable direction and partly easterly, which led to deterioration in air quality even though wind speed started picking up on Sunday.

People will not get relief from the rising pollution as the Air Quality Early Warning System of the Indian meteorological department on Sunday predicted that the pollution level of Patna will remain in the ‘poor' category until Tuesday, owing to a lower ventilation index and average wind speed, which will be unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants.
Samanpura and Rajbansi Nagar emerged as severely polluted zones, with PM2.5 levels consistently exceeding safe thresholds, reaching 170 µg/m³ in peak zones, stated the recently released report titled ‘Decoding Urban Air: Hyperlocal Insights into PM2.5 Pollution Across Indian Metropolises'. It highlights the need for precise, localised efforts to protect public health and improve urban air quality.

On the factors driving the pollution level on the high end, the experts attributed crop residue burning in surrounding areas, vehicular congestion, and rapid urban expansion as major contributors to the city's pollution hotspots. The report outlines actionable recommendations to address urban air pollution, including implementing targeted emission controls and expanding low-emission zones; integrating urban forestry and green infrastructure to act as natural pollution buffers, and promoting public awareness through real-time data tools and educational campaigns.
The report has used hyperlocal monitoring to identify the pollution spikes and hotspots that traditional systems have failed to detect.

The CSE analysis points out that the existing ""mobility crisis"" — major lapses despite the strengthening of transport infrastructure over the years — has led to a sharp rise in the private vehicle fleet and these account for a high contribution to pollution in the winter, so much so that even when harvest stubble burning has been low, Delhi's air quality has remained at the ‘poor' or ‘very poor' level.

On Wednesday, Sunita Narain, director general, CSE, and Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, held urban transport to be the main source of local emissions. They batted for the strengthening of local transport while pointing out that less than 1% of the city's bus stops had a waiting period of less than 10 minutes.
CSE also asserted that while peak pollution levels in the city have declined in recent years, the average has increased, suggesting local pollution sources are at play. It pointed out how while pollutant levels have dropped since 2019, Delhi still needed to reduce them by huge volumes to meet acceptable norms.

Based on the analysis of CPCB data, CSE found that from Oct till Jan, the 24-hour peak PM2.5 concentration in the winter months reduced from 566 micrograms per cubic metre in 2019-20 to 366 in 2023-24. Yet, despite the 35% drop, it was still six times the 24-hourly national average of 60 units. Despite this dip in the peak pollution levels, CSE noted that the average PM2.5 has steadily increased from 173 micrograms per cubic metre in 2019-10 to 189 last winter.
""In 2023, Delhi's citywide annual average for PM2.5 stood at 101 micrograms per cubic metre, reflecting a 7% improvement since 2019, when the level was at 109. Despite this progress, the city still faces a significant challenge in curbing air pollution because Delhi needs to reduce PM2.5 levels by an additional 61% to meet the national annual air quality standard of 40 microgram per cubic metre,"" adds the CSE assessment.
""The findings suggest that while emergency actions are working, the overall sources are likely to increase, including vehicles, which have emerged as the largest polluters in the city,"" said Roychowdhury. ""The emission inventory studies for Delhi done by IIT Kanpur in 2015, TERI-ARAI in 2018 and Safar, also in 2018, have determined the transport sector's contribution to PM2.5 to be, respectively, 20%, 39% and 41%. Among combustion sources, it is the highest source and annually, it is the second biggest source behind dust."" Roychowdhury said that more efforts were required to improve public transport.
The CSE analysis underlines issues like the lack of reliability on public transport. For example, instances of buses breaking down mid-journey rose to 1,259 in 2022-23 from 781 in 2018-19. The analysis also called attention to the high waiting times for buses, revealing that passengers had to wait for less than 10 minutes at fewer than 1% of the city's bus stops. Around 50% of the bus stops currently had a waiting time of over 15 minutes.
As per the Economic Survey Delhi 2023-24, the capital has 79 lakh vehicles and 6.5 lakh new vehicles were added in 2023-24 itself (6.1 lakh annual addition in the pre-pandemic years). In addition, 1.1 million vehicles entered and exited the city daily. Two-wheelers and cars are growing at the same annual pace of 15%, adding that transport accounts for 81% of nitrogen oxide emissions.
CSE observed that the city's expansion into peripheral areas has caused the per capita trip rate to rise 12.3% and average trip length to go up by a staggering 81.7%. These were also factors leading to the rise in private vehicle use."

Assistant sub-inspector Sheovir's ordeal is similar. He is on the road on his motorcycle for hours on patrol, regardless of what AQI is.
The plight of the traffic cops and patrol officers is easily ignored by the citizenry. These unsung heroes are exposed to abnormal pollution levels, risking them to severe health implications. ""From respiratory problems to cardiovascular diseases, the threats are numerous,"" noted a retired Delhi Traffic Police chief. ""The constant presence of vehicular emissions, particulate matter and toxic pollutants on busy roadways takes a toll on the health of the personnel, leaving them increasingly vulnerable to respiratory problems.""
Many traffic cops in the city can be seen consuming cough lozenges or toffees for relief from hacking cough. TOI even discovered some to be carrying cough syrups on doctors' recommendations.
Speaking with TOI, SI (traffic) Tomar, stationed at the Teen Murti roundabout, recounted the challenges faced during periods of severe pollution. ""Our eyes become irritated and watery,"" he said, describing the discomfort experienced by the police personnel. ""To alleviate the discomfort, we keep water jars at hand and regularly splash water on our faces."" Another traffic cop added, ""We wear masks, but they are of little help. The eyes keep stinging through the day and the throat dries up. But we have a job that needs to be done.""

ASI (traffic) Sheovir explained that their primary duty involved regulating traffic flow, which required them to assume a stationary position. ""We encounter a wide range of situations in the course of our duty. As soon as AQI surpasses the 300 mark, we don face masks to protect ourselves. The severe pollution often triggers coughing fits,"" Sheovir said, adding that they were all provided with necessary masks to safeguard their health. Senior officers maintained regular contact with them to monitor their well-being, he said.

In a central Delhi location, a policeman confirmed that they patrolled in shifts and employed various methods such as foot patrols, motorcycle patrols and vehicular patrols. Even then, the personnel were completely exposed to pollution. ""To mitigate the effects of pollution, we wear masks while on duty,"" he revealed.
A study conducted on traffic police personnel in Kolkata recommended implementing a roster system to shield the individuals from prolonged exposure. A scheduling mechanism ensures adequate coverage of traffic while rotating personnel through shifts, minimising the continuity of exposure to pollution.
In Delhi, the traffic brass has increased deployment at identified traffic intersections to allow police personnel to work in shifts while facilitating adequate for everyone. Those who develop respiratory or other problems are posted on other duties during periods when pollution levels are abnormal.
Ajay Choudhary, special commissioner of police (Traffic), said that he instructed the personnel to wear masks and to consume warm water always and had initiated yoga classes to promote physical and mental well-being.
Another senior officer said, ""We have asked the boots-on-the-ground to identify early symptoms like excessive coughing so preventive action can be taken.""
Dealing with motorists who react aggressively to being stopped for violating anti-pollution regulations is also a challenge. ""Such drivers often claim ignorance of the GRAP rules and question our authority to stop their vehicles. We exercise patience and tact to calm them down and make them aware of the regulations,"" the officer said.
For many cops, it's a déjà vu of Covid times when road patrolling was both crucial but a health hazard. Like the pandemic, policemen can only hope things get better soon."

While the air quality remained ‘moderate' for the fifth time this month, it was just a few points shy of being in the ‘poor' category.
Of the four monitoring stations in the city,
Teri Gram recorded the worst AQI at a 'poor' 218, followed by Sector 51 (213), Gwal Pahari (200) and Vikas Sadan (175).
Following the Supreme Court's revocation of GRAP 4 on Dec 5, the region is currently under GRAP 2, under which residents are advised to limit the use of private vehicles and follow guidelines regarding the operation of diesel generators. On Saturday, the city's wind speed plummeted to 3 kmph from 7 kmph the previous day.

The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) predicted that pollution levels in NCR will continue to worsen over the next six days, with AQI expected to reach the ‘poor' and ‘very poor' categories.
Safar also noted that wind speeds below 3 kmph would lead to airborne pollutants remaining suspended in the air, exacerbating the pollution levels.
The levels of PM2.5, toxic particles that can penetrate into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, also increased, HSPCB said. While the permissible PM2.5 limit is 60 µg/m³, the levels at Teri Gram rose from 123 µg/m³ on Friday to 308 µg/m³ on Saturday. At Sector 51, PM2.5 increased from 264 µg/m³ to 321 µg/m³, while at Vikas Sadan, it went from 148 µg/m³ to 220 µg/m³. At Gwal Pahari, the level jumped from 130 µg/m³ on Friday to 318 µg/m³ on Saturday. PM2.5 can lead to serious health conditions such as asthma, stroke, and heart and lung diseases.

HSPCB officials have pointed out that localised factors, especially dust from unregulated construction activities and unpaved roads contribute majorly to the city's poor air quality. ""Dust is a primary cause of pollution, and we will take measures to reduce it,"" said Vijay Chaudhary, the regional officer of HSPCB. Air pollution has become a year-round problem for Delhi-NCR, especially during the winter, when adverse weather conditions trap pollutants in a toxic haze.
The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in NCR categorises the AQI into four stages: stage 1 (poor) for AQI between 201-300, stage 2 (very poor) for AQI between 301-400, stage 3 (severe) for AQI between 401-450, and stage 4 (severe+) for AQI above 450. Actions for stages 2, 3, and 4 are triggered at least three days in advance based on dynamic forecasts and meteorological predictions.
Meanwhile, the air quality of Delhi deteriorated on Saturday with the Air Quality Index (AQI) reaching 233 in the ‘poor' category after staying in the ‘moderate' range for three consecutive days. The overall air quality of Delhi is predicted to remain ‘poor' on Sunday and Monday, but it may worsen further to ‘very poor' on Tuesday.
Delhi's AQI significantly improved earlier this week after strong winds started blowing in the city. The AQI was 178 on Dec 4, 165 on Dec 5 and 197 on Dec 6. Winds with high speed cause the dispersion of pollutants, while calm winds cause the accumulation of pollutants. ""Light winds of 4 to 8 kmph blew during the daytime on Saturday, impacting the air quality. However, the winds turned calm during the evening. Similar conditions are likely to persist over the next two days,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice-chairman, Skymet Meteorology.
Apart from winds, low temperatures and inversion impacted the ventilation. The city recorded the season's lowest minimum temperature of 7.1 degrees Celsius on Saturday, three degrees below normal for this time of the year. ""Mainly clear sky conditions with wind speed less than 10 kmph northwest direction prevailed over the region in the forenoon on Saturday,"" said India Meteorological Department in its bulletin.
Two stations—Shadipur and Anand Vihar—even saw ‘very poor' AQI throughout the day with readings of 317 and 310, respectively, at 4 pm, shows Central Pollution Control Board's data.
In the neighbouring cities, Greater Noida also recorded poor air quality with an AQI of 218.
However, AQI remained in the ‘moderate' category at Noida (179), Ghaziabad (175), Gurgaon (198) and Faridabad (199).
According to the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, which is the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, the air quality is likely to remain ‘poor' on Sunday and Monday, but may reach the ‘very poor' band on Tuesday. At present, measures under stages I and II of the Graded Response Action Plan are in force.
An AQI reading of 50 or below is classified as ‘good', while readings between 51 and 100 fall in the ‘satisfactory' category, and those between 101 and 200 are classified as ‘moderate'. ‘Poor' air ranges from 201 to 300, ‘very poor' from 301 to 400, and ‘severe' from 401 to 500.
Supreme Court on Thursday asked the Commission for Air Quality Management that Grap-3 should be imposed immediately if AQI goes above 350 and Grap-4 should kick in if it crosses 400.

""The predominant surface wind is likely to be from the south-east direction with a speed of less than 10 kmph during the morning hours of Sunday,"" it said.
The IITM also forecast smog or mist and possibility of very light rain on Sunday evening. This could led to a further drop in temperatures.

Pune: The civic body will resume issuing showcause notices to the construction sites causing air pollution, almost a year after its first attempt to clean up teh city.
According to the municipal corporation officials, pollution levels increased in the city because of civil works across the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) areas. The civic administration has instructed the contractors to adhere to norms and safety guidelines, including the use of green nets and large iron sheets, to prevent pollution. Sites not following these norms would be fined, and showcause notices would be issued beforehand.
""The administration issued instructions after authorities like the state pollution board raised concerns about air pollution. The monitoring is being done across the civic areas to check the sites not complying with them,"" said Rajendra Bhosale, the commissioner and the administrator of PMC.

Apart from the norms in the Unified Development Control and Promotion Regulations (UDCPR), PMC came out with new directives on the lines of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Guarding the construction sites with tin sheets was made mandatory for developers and contractors.
Projects like flyovers, bridges, roads and public transport facilities under way add to the pollution in Sinhagad Road, Kothrud, Bavdhan, Baner, Pashan, Aundh, NIBM Road, Kondhwa, Solapur Road and Satara Road areas. Residents observed that special measures were needed to curb this pollution and the administration must ensure strict compliance with the norms.

""The dust particles not only cause hassles to the residents of the areas concerned, but also to the commuters. The problem of pollution exists because of heavy traffic. Construction works without proper safety precautions are aggravating the situation,"" said Samir Paranjape, a resident of the Sinhagad Road area.
Another civic official said the administration had taken an identical action in 2023. It served notices to 124 developers.
Credai Pune chapter issued a statement stating that it had urged its members to follow the norms and advised its members to install sprinklers at construction sites to bring down the pollution. Guidelines were also issued to put up a minimum of 14 feet high GI/metal sheets and six feet high green cloth on them around the periphery of the project construction sites.
A senior official of PMC said squads would be constituted this time to monitor the movement of trucks ferrying gravel, soil and crushed stones to construction sites from building material suppliers. They will also keep a watch on cement spillages from mixers to reduce pollution.

Hyderabad: As Hyderabad grapples with alarming levels of particulate matter (PM) pollution—rising by 100 times in some areas—environmentalists have raised an alarm over the growing count of another pollutant: nitrogen dioxide (NO₂). According to them, NO₂ poses a serious risk to public health, especially for children and the elderly.
A recent Greenpeace report titled: Beyond North: NO₂ Pollution and Health Risks in Seven Major Indian Cities, has revealed that Hyderabad experienced dangerously high NO₂ levels on 307 days out of 365 last year, far surpassing other major cities like Mumbai (256 days), Bengaluru (295 days), and Kolkata (133 days).
While analysing NO₂ levels across seven cities—Chennai, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Pune, and Jaipur—it found that Gachibowli had the highest NO₂ levels at 41 parts per billion (ppb) in 2023. This was followed by Old City (23 ppb), Bolarum (22 ppb), and Sanathnagar.
These figures are two to four times higher than the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommended safe limit of 10 ppb.

Environmental experts say that it is a cause for concern, especially since NO₂ is often overlooked in discussions about air quality, despite it being highly toxic.
""Nitrogen dioxide is a near-invisible toxic gas that is directly tied to road traffic and fuel combustion, making it prevalent in most urban areas. While particulate matter has long been a focal point of air quality discussions, NO₂ pollution remains largely neglected. The largest source of NO₂ pollution in cities comes from road traffic. Cars, trucks, and buses emit nitrogen oxides (NO and NO₂) during fuel combustion,"" said S Bhaskar Reddy, an environmentalist who conducted studies on pollutants in metro cities.

The report reiterates this. ""The role of road traffic is crucial, as it consistently ranks among the top three sectors responsible for nitrogen oxide emissions (NO₂ and NO), according to the EDGAR emissions database. In Hyderabad, road traffic accounts for nearly a quarter of total nitrogen oxide emissions,"" the report stated.
Reddy also said that industries and power plants that burn coal, oil, or natural gas for energy production contribute significantly to NO₂ pollution. He added: ""While not a direct source of NO₂, the dust from construction activities and road traffic can contribute to the formation of NO₂ in the atmosphere when combined with other pollutants.""
2015 study linked NO₂ emission to paediatric asthma
In fact in 2015, as per the Greenpeace report, a study had linked NO₂ pollution to 2,430 paediatric asthma cases in Hyderabad, with road transport contributing to 24% of NO₂ emissions. Worse, in 2019, 2,800 deaths were attributed to NO₂ pollution with 18 ppb being an average NO₂ level in the city, as per the latest report.
City doctors confirm its adverse effect on public health. Calling it a ‘slow killer', Dr Tejas Jogi, a pulmonologist, said, ""Prolonged exposure to NO₂ can have severe health consequences, particularly for children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions. NO₂ irritates the airways, causing inflammation and reducing lung function. It can trigger or worsen asthma attacks and has been linked to an increased risk of respiratory infections. Over time, high levels of NO₂ exposure can contribute to the development of chronic respiratory diseases and cardiovascular problems,"" he said.
According to him, the invisible nature of this gas often leads to its effects being underestimated. ""But its impact on public health is profound and long-lasting,"" he added.

Bhubaneswar: Angul was the fourth most polluted city in the country recording an AQI (Air Quality Index) of 323, while neighbouring Talcher took the sixth spot with an AQI of 302.
Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)'s daily AQI monitoring rated the ambient air quality in both towns as ‘very poor', according to the reading from Thursday night. The readings were taken from two locations in both towns. By Friday evening, the rating had improved to ‘poor'.
State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) officials attributed the sudden spike in air pollution in early Dec in the twin industrial towns to ongoing road expansion work and coal and mineral transporting vehicles.
The twin cities, however, record high PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels throughout the day, especially in winter. ""Winter fog, dust generated from road work, and general dust due to vehicular movement are additional factors that have increased air pollution. We are monitoring the AQI through monitoring stations and are issuing notices to industries to take steps to suppress dust and ash generated from plants,"" a pollution board officer said.

Angul has major steel and sponge iron industries, while adjoining Talcher has coal fields and thermal power plant.
SPCB officials said the main concern is the level of PM 2.5, microparticles that can directly enter the lungs. ""PM 10 can be blocked by natural barriers in nasal cavities, but PM 2.5 can travel in and get deposited in the lungs. We are receiving a lot of complaints of respiratory complications from people in the Angul-Talcher belt. In other industrial areas, people experience asthmatic attacks, respiratory disorders and other complications because of sustained exposure to PM 10 and PM 2.5,"" said senior consultant (pulmonology), Sampat Dash.

Exposed ash pile-up and uncovered mineral and coal transporting vehicles add to the worsening air pollution. The industrial region sees only 30% of minerals being transported through the railways, sources said.
Last year, then forest and environment minister Pradip Amat told the assembly that three cities — Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Rourkela — and four towns — Angul, Talcher, Balasore and Kalinganagar — were reporting high air pollution.

The finding released in a report titled ‘Decoding Urban Air: Hyperlocal Insights into PM2.5 Pollution Across Major Indian Cities' underscores the urgent need for localised strategies to protect public health and improve urban air quality.
The report has used hyperlocal monitoring to identify the pollution spikes and hotspots that traditional systems have failed to detect. The report, prepared by Respirer Living Sciences, integrates advanced technology with hyperlocal monitoring, providing granular insights into urban air pollution. Unlike traditional data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which often overlooks unmonitored areas, Respirer used over 150 sensors and Google Maps' Air Quality API to analyse pollution trends with a 500m×500 metre resolution.
""Hyperlocal air quality monitoring bridges the gap left by traditional systems, offering street-level insights that empower targeted interventions,"" said Ronak Sutaria, founder and CEO of Respirer Living Sciences. Such insights are valuable in identifying unmonitored areas and addressing previously invisible pollution challenges, he added. The study included 10 cities, including New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chandigarh, Patna, Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. By combining CPCB data with Respirer's AtlasAQ platform, it provided actionable insights for urban planners, policymakers, and citizens.

'Severe' category
Delhi's AQI has consistently stayed in the ""very poor"" range since October 30. Wednesday marked the first instance this season where it reached the ""severe"" category.

The smog, which had been lingering over parts of Punjab and eastern Pakistan for several days, extended to large areas of northern India by early Wednesday.
It quickly combined with local pollutants, creating a dense, toxic haze across the NCR. Delhi’s average AQI rose to 418, the worst in the country. The last time Delhi recorded a higher AQI was on January 14, at 447.
Despite the high AQI, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) described it as an ""episodic event"" and opted not to implement restrictive measures under Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).
The CAQM stated that AQI levels were likely to improve to the ""very poor"" range by Friday due to anticipated strong winds.
The CPCB classifies AQI as follows: 0-50 as ""good,"" 51-100 ""satisfactory,"" 101-200 ""moderate,"" 201-300 ""poor,"" 301-400 ""very poor,"" 401-450 ""severe,"" and above 450 as ""severe plus."""

Experts said Nov 1-15 is the most polluted because the period coincides with Diwali, when fireworks are burst, the peak harvest stubble burning in neighbouring states and an increase in traffic intensity due to the festivals. During the period, meteorological conditions, including slow or calm winds, low temperature and inversion impact the dispersion of pollutants. The stretch from Dec 15 to 31 is also a polluted period for similar reasons of an increase in traffic flow due to festivals and unfavourable meteorology, including dense fog.

The Central Pollution Control Board's data shows that Delhi's AQI has been hovering in the ‘very poor' category since Oct 27, except Oct 29 when it briefly improved to the ‘poor' band due to strong winds. However, the air quality worsened in the past two days, with the city recording AQI in the higher end of the ‘very poor' category. Delhi's average AQI was 382 on Sunday, with 14 stations remaining in the ‘severe' category throughout the day. AQI on Monday was 381, with 16 stations surpassing AQI of 400 by the evening.
Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, explained, ""Due to cool and calm atmospheric conditions, air gets trapped and the pollutants are simultaneously trapped too. This is the reason why we see a sudden spurt in pollution. If the local and regional pollution is already high, the severity of the pollution gets even more intense. This requires round-the-year sustained efforts to cut emissions from all key sources.""
Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB's air laboratory, said the air quality worsening at this time is a seasonal phenomenon, but it is also a public health issue and a concern for everyone. ""All stakeholders should focus on cutting down emissions with awareness of their shared responsibility. It is a health emergency matter. Thus, healthcare centres must remain equipped adequately for all emergency demands,"" said Saha.
He added, ""the Graded Response Action Plan, which is an emergency measure introduced when AQI deteriorates, hasn't yet added health centres linkage. It needs to be incorporated in GRAP immediately so that primary healthcare facilities can develop the necessary infrastructure and faculties."""

NEW DELHI: Delhi witnessed a significant drop in temperature on Friday, with the minimum temperature recorded at 8.5°C at 8.30am, signaling the onset of winter. The dip, nearly two degrees lower than the previous day, is attributed to cold northwesterly winds sweeping through the region.
A shallow fog enveloped the city in the morning, adding to the winter chill. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) predicts a further decline, with the minimum temperature expected to reach 6°C by December 10.
The national capital also saw an improvement in its air quality, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) settling in the 'moderate' category at 183 as of 7 am, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

Delhi's air quality had been persistently in the 'severe' and 'very poor' categories post-Diwali, causing health issues among residents.
However, the Supreme Court allowed the relaxation of GRAP stage IV restrictions to GRAP stage II on Thursday, citing the improvement.
Weather outlook

The IMD forecasts a gradual fall in minimum temperatures across Northwest India by 2-3°C over the week. Although there’s a low probability of cold wave conditions in regions like north Rajasthan, Punjab, and Haryana during the second half of the week, the passage of a western disturbance on December 9 might influence weather patterns.

Research at national and international level have shown a correlation between air pollutants (especially PM 2.5) and diabetes.

Last year, a study published in the BMJ Open Diabetes Research and Care journal observed evidence of a temporal association between exposure to PM (particulate matter) 2.5 and higher fasting blood plasma glucose (FPG) and incident Type 2 diabetes in two cities in the country. In May this year, an article published in the Journal of Association of Physicians of India (JAPI) stated, ""Studies from the United States and Europe have revealed that there is a definite link between incident Type 2 diabetes and ambient PM2.5.""
Dr Alok Kanungo, a diabetologist, said a reduction in oxygen saturation in the environment will impact blood pressure. Later, it will increase the blood sugar level. ""I feel urban air pollution is one of the reasons for the increasing trend of diabetes in the country. Now researchers across the world have linked increasing air pollution with Type 2 diabetes,"" he added.

Dr Kishore Kumar Behera, head of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism department at AIIMS Bhubaneswar, said endocrine disruptors in the form of plastic and fertilisers are toxic for the pancreas affecting insulin secretion and leading to insulin resistance. ""Pollution has some toxic effect on the beta cells of pancreas, which may lead to development of diabetes in susceptible persons,"" he added. He also stated that more studies should be conducted to find out the link between air pollution and Type 2 diabetes in India.

The article published in JAPI stated that particular interest has been directed towards the effects of air pollutants as ‘endocrine disruptors' leading to Type 2 diabetes. Dr Debarchan Jena, assistant professor of endocrinology department at SCB Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack, said efforts must be made by all stakeholders to reduce air pollution. ""If researchers from other parts of the world have established a link between air pollution and Type 2 diabetes, we need to think about it. People can use face masks to reduce direct exposure to PM 2.5,"" he added.
Dr Satyajit Tripathy, an endocrinologist, said he went through some research articles establishing a link between air pollution and Type 2 diabetes. ""But the studies were done for Delhi and Mumbai. We need to conduct more region and area-specific studies to know the impact of air pollution in Odisha,"" he added."

Recent findings from research journals present a sobering reality. In 2019, approximately one-fifth of the global Type 2 diabetes burden was attributed to air pollution, with devastating consequences. The statistics are concerning; air pollution-related diabetes resulted in 3.78 deaths per 100,000 population, with ambient air pollution accounting for 13.4% of Type 2 diabetes deaths. Household air pollution contributed to 6.50% of these fatalities, highlighting the dual threat of outdoor and indoor air quality.
Professor and head of department of endocrinology at a Faridabad-based hospital, Dr Sachin Kumar Jain, said, ""Winter brings a significant increase in smog and pollution levels, creating additional risks for diabetic patients. Research published in ‘The Environmental Health Perspectives Journal' confirms that poor air quality during colder months intensifies insulin resistance and inflammation in diabetic individuals."" He further said urban residents face particular risks as city environments typically experience higher pollution levels.
""Studies in diabetes care indicate that urban air pollution creates a perfect storm of health challenges for diabetic patients, making disease management more complex,"" he said, adding, ""The winter months often lead to decreased physical activities and increased risk for people living with diabetes.""

City-based diabetologist, Dr Subhash Kumar, said air pollution was the non-traditional risk factor. ""While awareness is there regarding traditional risk factors associated with diabetes like family history and obesity, many are not aware of non-traditional risk factors, which include air pollution, endocrine-disrupting chemicals released from plastic water bottles or food packaging materials, and sweetened beverages,"" said Dr Kumar.

While the city's overall NO₂ level stayed within the WHO standard of 10 g/m³ on 80% of days, it climbed significantly on the remaining days to take the annual average to 28 g/m³. The national standard for NO₂ is 40 g/m³.
The Greenpeace report, titled 'Beyond north India: NO₂ Pollution and Health Risks in Seven Major Indian Cities', ranks Kolkata third among the seven cities in NO₂ concentration. Pune was at the top with 37 g/m³, followed by Jaipur at 36 g/m³.
A toxic gas closely linked to traffic and fuel burning, NO₂ is common in urban areas. Scientific evidence shows long-term NO₂ exposure can lead to lung damage, allergies, increase respiratory mortality, circulatory diseases and heart conditions. Prolonged exposure to high NO₂ levels is particularly harmful for children. A 2019 study by Achakulwisut et al. estimated that NO₂ pollution in Kolkata contributed to 3,210 cases of paediatric asthma in 2015, the report mentions.

Howrah bridge designers in town for health audit
Experts from the UK-based original designers of Howrah bridge-Rendel Ltd (formerly Rendel, Palmer & Triton, UK)-are in town for the health check-up of the iconic structure. They started the inspection of the bridge on Tuesday.
Senior consultant Michael J King, and bridges team leader and assistant technical director Omar Nabeel are an integral part of the health audit, being carried out to ensure long-term durability and safety of the historic bridge, officially called Rabindra Setu.

Shyama Prasad Mookerjee Port (SMP), custodian of Howrah bridge, world's sixth longest cantilever bridge, shut it down on the night of Nov 16 for the first health audit since the 1980s. Railways consultancy RITES, which had conducted the last health audit between 1983 and 1988, is carrying out the job this time, too. The study will go on for the next two months and the report will be submitted by March 2025. ""According to the current contract, RITES has engaged Rendel Ltd with critical tasks, such as providing documents relating to the design and drawings, visual inspection, assessment reports, and review of rehabilitation and strengthening proposals of Rabindra Setu,"" Rathendra Raman, chairman, Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port, said.
The last such audit for Howrah bridge was initiated in 1983 after the structure served continuously for 40 years. At that time, RITES collaborated with Rendel, Palmer & Triton (M/S RPT), the main designers of the bridge. The study recommended ultrasonic and non-destructive tests, restoration and retrofitting for enhancing the bridge's life. These were executed in the next few years.
The Rendel team on Wednesday had a detailed discussion with the chairman, representatives from RITES and engineers from the port. ""The team outlined their findings from the ongoing inspection and shared insights into the bridge's structural condition. The final condition assessment report, vetted by M/s Rendel, may be submitted by the first quarter of 2025,"" Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port spokesperson Sanjay Mukherjee said. ""Based on this report, RITES will propose a comprehensive repair and rehabilitation scheme to strengthen the bridge, securing its legacy for future generations.""
The bridge, designed by Rendel, Palmer & Tritton (RPT) of London and fabricated by Braithwaite Burn & Jessop, used 26,500 MT of steel. ""The bridge has stood as a symbol of strength and innovation for decades. It will continue to do so in the years to come,"" Raman said.

CAQM had imposed Stage III restrictions on Nov 14 when AQI hit 424 and Stage IV on Nov 17 with AQI at 441. On Nov 18, when the AQI was 494 — the most polluted day of the season — the Supreme Court upheld the imposition of GRAP Stage IV. The court reviewed the situation on Dec 2 and directed a further review on Dec 5.
On Thursday, CAQM said in a statement that while the Supreme Court had directed the operation of GRAP Stage IV even if AQI dropped below 450, it had, based on the air quality data placed before it, permitted the commission to revoke Stage IV ""but not to go below Stage II of GRAP for the present"". It added that the GRAP sub-committee held a meeting to review the meteorological situations and forecasts for the region and noted AQI had continuously improved since Nov 24, and on Thursday, was 165 or moderate, ""which is about 135 AQI points below the thresholds for invoking Stage II (AQI 301-400)"".


CAQM explained, ""The air quality forecasts by IMD/IITM also do not indicate much degradation in the overall air quality of Delhi-NCR in the coming days. Therefore, keeping in view the prevailing trend of air quality and forecasts for meteorological conditions and air quality index made available by IMD/IITM and also the disruptive nature of restrictive actions under Stages IV and III of GRAP impacting a large number of stakeholders and the public at large, the sub-committee on GRAP unanimously decides to revoke stages III and IV of GRAP in the entire NCR with immediate effect."" It said all implementing agencies would keep a strict vigil and especially intensify measures under stages I and II of GRAP.
Despite the higher states being revoked, keeping in view the unfavourable winter season and in order to ensure that AQI did not dip, CAQM requested people to strictly adhere to the citizen charter on pollution.
Meanwhile on Thursday, the city's air quality improved further and continued in the ‘moderate' zone, with none of the air monitoring stations reporting ‘very poor' reading. AQI, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 161 at 11am, which rose marginally to 165 by 3pm and 163 at 6pm.
North-westerly winds reaching over 20 kmph helped improve the air quality over the past 24 hours. The average AQI on Thursday was 165 against 178 a day earlier, both ‘moderate'. The city has seen the air improving from ‘poor' to ‘moderate' for over two days. On Thursday, none of the areas of the city fell in the ‘very poor' category, though a few did record pollution levels at the ‘poor' AQI levels.

""Sub-engineers need to be accustomed to monitoring air or other environment pollution-related aspects and ensure the implementation of the guidelines issued by BMC in October last year,"" said an official.
As the department is yet to be provided with dedicated sub-engineers, additional charge of implementing its tasks have been entrusted to sub-engineers of BMC's mechanical & electrical engineering department at the ward level.
""The sub-engineers will have to visit the site and check whether it is complying with guidelines and recommend corrective action if the contractors or project proponents are found violating guidelines,"" said a BMC official. ""If instances of dust on the road contributing to pollution are found, the sub-engineer can get in touch with SWM officials and facilitate the deployment of tankers for road cleaning or use misting machines to control dust.

If non-compliance with air pollution mitigation measures is found at construction sites on repeat visits, actions such as show cause notice, stop work notice, or imposition of penalty have been detailed in the SOP.
Earlier, the BMC made it mandatory for contractors of infrastructure projects within the civic jurisdiction to submit EMPs, which need to list sources of pollution at the site along with mitigation plans. BMC officials said contractors have been submitting plans and steps will be taken to penalise those who don't.

BMC had set up squads at the ward level to monitor air pollution mitigation measures. But the work was affected due to the conduct of elections, as a large number of BMC employees were deployed on poll duty. The squads are expected to be back in action soon.

""Tourism is declining and our global reputation is crumbling. The cloud of pollution covers hundreds of kilometres. Cleaning it up will need major changes and decisive action--from governments, companies, experts and citizens. We need a collective national response, not political blame games,"" he said.
Meanwhile, hours after the Supreme Court permitted the relaxation of GRAP Stage IV restrictions in Delhi-NCR to GRAP Stage II, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Thursday revoked Stages IV and III of GRAP in the region.
However, GRAP Stages II and I will continue to remain in force across the entire NCR.

A layer of smog continued to blanket the city and surrounding areas.



A cyclist near India Gate complained that he had to halt his routine due to the increasing pollution.
""I come here to cycle daily. However, I had to stop cycling for some time due to no visibility and high level of pollution in the city. It is getting difficult to breathe. The government needs to take some action on this urgently. Locals should also cooperate with the government and take precautionary measures,"" he said.

A senior citizen complained that he and his grandchildren had been facing breathing issues and throat pain because of the pollution.
""We are facing a lot of problems. I am a senior citizen. My grandchildren are also suffering from problems while going to school. We are having breathing issues, irritation in the eyes and throat pain. The main reason behind this is the use of vehicles and stubble burning.

According to the CPCB, the primary pollutant in Delhi on Tuesday was PM10.
This particulate matter, measuring 10 micrometers or less in diameter, comprises tiny solid or liquid particles suspended in the air that can be inhaled into the lungs.
PM10 sources include dust, pollen, mold, vehicle emissions, and industrial discharges. When inhaled, these particles can lead to respiratory problems, including asthma and bronchitis and increase the risk of heart and lung diseases with prolonged exposure.
Alongside transportation, other contributors to Delhi’s pollution include stubble burning.

Bryan Johnson, the millionaire entrepreneur known for his ambitious age-reversal project Blueprint, is finding India to be as thought-provoking as his futuristic health experiments. Currently touring the country, Johnson has been charmed by India’s distinct cultural quirks — from its humor-laden camaraderie to its scrappy innovation — and has been sharing his observations in ways that have sparked lively conversations online.
On Tuesday, Johnson sent Indian Twitter into a frenzy with his candid admiration for the nation’s lighthearted social dynamics. “I love the culture of bak***** in India. It perfectly captures my worldview: take your work seriously, not yourself,” he tweeted. The post resonated widely, racking up over 50,000 views and prompting a flood of reactions.

Among the responses, one user brought up “jugaad,” India’s celebrated knack for frugal innovation. Johnson weighed in thoughtfully: “I like jugaad — most innovation comes from frugality. But if it means taking shortcuts, we are in trouble. Fixing air pollution in India will require an overhaul, can’t be done with jugaad.”

His comment struck a nerve, as it touched on a pressing issue — air pollution. With cities like Delhi and Mumbai reeling from hazardous air quality, Johnson’s perspective aligns with the growing call for systemic, sustainable solutions.

Speaking at an event earlier this week at Mumbai’s Soho House, where he interacted with Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal and comedian Tanmay Bhat, Johnson elaborated on his views. “Fixing air pollution in India is not a one-step process. It will require systemic changes, but I am optimistic about India’s potential to innovate its way out of this,” he said.

Known for his rigid health regimen — including a plant-based diet, over 100 daily supplements, and even plasma transfusions — Johnson has been equally noted for his ability to blend discipline with curiosity. His openness to Indian culture has won him new fans, with many praising his ability to connect humor and innovation in his reflections.
While Bryan Johnson's health experiments may be aimed at reversing his biological age, his candid embrace of India's ""bakchodi"" shows he’s more than willing to laugh along the way."

Jaipur: As Delhi continues to witness hazardous air quality, its effects have become noticeable in Jaipur, leading to an increase in respiratory ailments at local healthcare facilities.
Healthcare professionals are found cautioning patients with existing respiratory conditions to refrain from early morning exercise. ""In early mornings, a layer of smog can be easily visible in Jaipur. If a patient of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or an asthma patient goes out for a walk in the morning, they will invariably inhale it, and it could worsen their symptoms. When the sun rises fully, the layers of smog lift. So it is better to wait till the sun rises before one starts their morning walk,"" said Dr Virendra Singh, senior pulmonologist and president of a private hospital in the city.
Specialists in respiratory medicine warned that not only individuals with chronic lung conditions but also people sensitive to polluted air are also at risk under the rising levels of air pollution.
""If the air has a high content of carbon monoxide, sulphur oxide and nitrogen oxides, it become toxic. Even healthy people may face respiratory issues if they are exposed to toxic air for a prolonged period. In the past few days, there is a rise in patients with respiratory complaints due to rising air pollution,"" said Dr Ajit Singh, medical superintendent of RUHS Hospital, who is an expert in respiratory diseases.
Jaipur's air quality index (AQI) on Thursday indicated that city residents inhaled air of ""poor"" quality. Since Nov 18, AQI has been categorised ""poor"" in the city, and it is continuously deteriorating."

NEW DELHI: Residents in Delhi experienced some relief on Thursday as the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) improved to the ‘moderate’ category following weeks of severe pollution. The AQI was recorded at 161 as of 8am according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).
Despite the improvement, a thin layer of smog covered the city as winter set in, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reporting a minimum temperature of 9°C, accompanied by mist in the air.
The AQI varied across different areas of Delhi, with Anand Vihar at 178, Chandni Chowk at 194, and ITO at 130, all falling under the 'moderate' category. However, areas like RK Puram (204), Mundka (222), and Shadipur (249) recorded 'poor' air quality.
An AQI between 101-200 is categorized as 'moderate,' 201-300 as 'poor,' and 301-400 as 'very poor.' The city had been grappling with 'severe' and 'very poor' air quality post-Diwali, leading to breathing difficulties and health complaints among residents.

To tackle the worsening pollution, the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)-IV measures were enforced, including a ban on BS-IV diesel-operated medium and heavy goods vehicles, except for essential services.
As the winter chill sets in, Delhi’s minimum temperature dropped to 9°C on Thursday, signaling the onset of colder weather. The IMD predicts further temperature drops over the next five days. Meanwhile, Agra’s air quality was recorded as 'satisfactory' this morning, with visuals showing a golden hue over the Taj Mahal.
The Supreme Court recently ruled against relaxing the GRAP-IV measures, maintaining a strict stance on air pollution control, and scheduled further hearings for necessary modifications.

Rain next week may lead to drop in temperatures
On Wednesday, the AQI was 194 at 11am, which by 3pm had improved to 179 and to 178 by 4pm, before dipping slightly to 181 by 5 pm.

Pollution monitoring agencies expect the AQI to remain in the moderate to poor range for another day before deteriorating to poor again.
According to weather analysts, the city is seeing consistently strong winds, which may continue for a few more days.

“The city saw wind speeds of 15-20 kmph on Wednesday. This may remain so for another few days. The wind direction was northwesterly. Consistently stronger winds coming from the same direction led to an improvement in the air quality,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice chairman, meteorology and climate change, Skymet.
Weather analysts also expect rain early next week under the impact of a western disturbance, which may lead to a drop in temperatures in the region. “A western disturbance might show its impact soon, around December 10. Under its influence, there are chances of fresh snowfall from December 8-10 and rain in Punjab, Haryana, and western Uttar Pradesh. There are chances that the rain might also occur in Delhi. Post these rains, the temperature may fall,” said Palawat.
On Wednesday, the city recorded a maximum temperature of 28 degrees Celsius, three notches above normal, against 28.2 degrees C a day ear- lier. The minimum temperature was recorded at 12 degrees C, a notch above normal, against 10.5 degrees C a day earlier. The maximum and minimum on Thursday are likely to hover around 26 and 10 degrees Celsius.
According to the advance air quality forecast, moderate air quality may continue for another day; however, it may may slip back to poor after December 6. On Wednesday, the PM2.5 levels hovered between 65.8 to 95.1 micrograms per cubic metre, against 24-hourly standards of 60 micrograms per cubic metre. The PM10 levels hovered between 148.1 to 187.7 micrograms per cubic metre, against the national standard of 100 units and 45 units as per WHO standards.

There is a limitation to our eyesight so don’t go too much with the appearances. What you often assume harmless, can wreak havoc on your health.
Dust can potentially affect your health. From coughing and bronchitis to even cancer, these tiny particles, which at times aren’t even visible to your eyes can cause you a lot of trouble.
Dust particles, often referred to as particulate matter (PM), are a collection of microscopic particles of material. The dust inside your home can be composed of dirt, skin cells, pet dander, mold spores, bacteria, dust mites, and mycotoxins among others.

What we most of the time tend to dismiss as ‘just dust’ could pose serious health hazards. Exposure to fine particulates that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter (PM2.5) is downright dangerous. Inhaling unhealthy levels of PM2.5 can pose serious health concerns such as increasing the risk of heart disease, asthma, and low birth weight, according to the New York State Department of Health.

The human eye can only see dust particles up to 40 microns, and the teeny tiny dust particles you cannot see can even perforate the lungs and enter your bloodstream. Short-term exposure to fine particulates that are 2.5 microns or less can result in coughing, watering eyes, asthma attacks, and chronic bronchitis. However, long-term exposure is linked with reduced kidney function, cardiac episodes, neurological disorders, cancer, and even death.


Winter diseases you must be careful about as days get colder

Some of the recent research suggests that PFAS (Polyfluoroalkyl Substances) aka forever chemicals have entered our homes. These substances are used in a range of products such as cookware, storage, makeup, clothing, mobile phones, etc. They can increase the risk of cancer, cause high cholesterol, thyroid disease, liver damage, asthma, allergies, and reduced vaccine response in children.

The report, released Thursday, highlighted that NO₂ levels in 2023 consistently exceeded both WHO's annual guideline of 10 µg/m³ and India's National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) of 40 µg/m³ at almost all air quality monitoring stations in the city. Chennai's average NO₂ concentration was found to be double the WHO guideline.
The highest pollution levels were recorded near Alandur Bus Depot. Two other stations — Gandhi Nagar in Ennore and Royapuram — also reported NO₂ concentrations above the WHO guideline. The report is a reminder that air pollution is not confined to North India but is a growing crisis in southern cities, including Chennai. Greenpeace said the transportation sector remains the largest contributor to NO₂ pollution in cities and has called for a comprehensive overhaul of Chennai's public transportation system, making it more accessible, efficient, and sustainable.
""Unfortunately, the number of MTC buses in Chennai has remained unchanged at around 3,300 for almost ten years now. Ideally, going by the Union urban ministry guidelines, Chennai should have at least 4,500 buses,"" said S Kamal, a transportation activist.
""Prolonged exposure to NO₂ is linked to asthma, respiratory inflammation, and cardiovascular diseases.

In 2023, 22 of 24 air quality monitoring stations recorded annual NO₂ concentrations exceeding WHO guidelines.
MUMBAI: The toxic nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) levels in the city's atmosphere are alarmingly high and are already taking a toll on Mumbaikars' health, a recent report ‘Beyond North India: NO₂ Pollution and Health Risks in Seven Major Indian Cities' based on pollution levels of 2023 revealed. The city's constantly congested road traffic emission is the main culprit behind this toxicity, it indicated.

""Last year, the city's annual average NO₂ concentration exceeded the WHO health guideline at 22 of 24 Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS). Malad West recorded the highest levels, followed by Bandra Kurla, a roadside station near a bus depot. Daily NO₂ averages also surpassed the guideline, with Mazgaon and Sion exceeding the limit for over 70% of the year. Mazgaon recorded 267 days above the limit,"" the report brought out by Greenpeace India stated.
Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) is a near-invisible toxic gas closely linked to traffic and fuel burning, common in urban areas. Vehicles and energy generation from fossil fuel are important sources of NO₂, which can cause lung and respiratory diseases mainly among children.

Overwhelming scientific evidence links NO₂ exposure to adverse health impacts such as the risk of asthma, airway inflammation, respiratory irritation, and worsening of existing respiratory conditions. It can impair lung development, intensify allergies, and increase susceptibility to respiratory mortality and death from circulatory diseases, ischemic heart disease, and lung cancer. Children are the most affected by continuous exposure to unhealthy concentrations of NO₂, with 3,970 cases of paediatric asthma attributed to NO2 pollution in the city in 2015.

It not only impacts our internal organs, but also can significantly harm our skin. Since our skin becomes the first point of contact for all external particles, it absorbs more pollutants than any other organ of the human body and thus its exposure to pollution for a longer period can result in serious skin diseases.

The impact of pollution can vary from people who have normal and healthy skin to those who already have some form of skin condition like eczema, psoriasis, acne or zoonosis.
Impact on Different Skin Types

Air pollution can contain both large particles and small particles. When people with normal skin are exposed to high level of air pollution, large particles go into the fold of the skin like around the eyes, nose, neck region and armpits, leading to a skin condition called Contact Irritant Dermatitis, causingirritation, excoriation, ulceration, secondary infection, scaring, etc. On the other hand, small particles, that are invisible to the naked eye, get absorbed into the skin through the pores and can cause inflammation inside the skin like in the epidermis or dermis leading to eczema, a long-term problem that can affect the immune system from inside.

For people with dry skin, air pollution can be more irritating especially during cold months when the pollution level is higher. Dry skin can be impacted more by the pollutants in the atmosphere, leading to irritation, scratching and worsening skin conditions. On the other hand, for people with oily skin, the sebum on the skin traps the air particles inside and make a layer on the skin. If this additional layer is not removed, it can cause acne, inflammation, etc., and block pores as well. However, in an attempt to get rid of this layer, skin often becomes dry- leading to irritation and other conditions mentioned above.


Impact on Skin Conditions

The impact of air pollution can be even more serious for people who already have some sort of skin condition. For people who have internal eczema, the irritation from the top of the skin and from inside can coincide; thereby, aggravating skin conditions like increased scratching and inflammation. Hence, people with eczema may suffer the most in high level of pollution like the patients of asthma. People with psoriasis can also suffer significantly due to air pollution. The autoimmune skin condition causes affected area to become scaly or itchy. This impacts the skin barrier and make way for external dust particles to enter the blood through psoriatic patches leading to inflammation and worsening of the skin.

How to Protect Your Skin?

To protect the skin from air pollution, moisturizing your skin is essential. One must pick a moisturiser that sits well with their skin type and build a healthy moisturizing routine. Furthermore, to keep the skin healthy people should avoid perfumes and deodorants as they can be potentially irritating and with pollutants they can cause worsening effect to the skin. Also, we recommend using hydrating soaps like cream bar soaps and avoid using soaps which are very alkaline.
You can also add a step of oiling to the routine. Herein, we suggest oiling your skin before bathing. Allow the oil to seep into your skin for 15-30 minutes before bathing with a gentle cream soap bar. Follow this with a moisturizer on slightly wet skin for complete care.
In a nutshell, the impact of air pollution is not only restricted to the health of an individual like the respiratory system, but it can have a significant impact on the skin health too. Therefore, by taking proper preventive measures and adopting an effective moisturizing regime, one can keep their skin protected from pollutants.

It is the city's lone source apportionment system and estimates the contribution of varied sources to the capital's air pollution.
DSS is being reviewed by an expert committee, revealed sources in the Commission for Air Quality Management, and it is expected to start operating soon after some changes are effected. However, experts said data should be updated for transparency and public awareness.
Launched in Oct 2021, and developed by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, and funded by CAQM, DSS estimates and forecasts the contribution of local sources of pollution and those in 19 NCR districts to Delhi's PM2.5. It also calculates the percentage contribution of stubble burning to the city's air pollution. The system is available only for the winter season (Oct to Feb). The last data available on the DSS website is for Nov 26-29. Last winter, DSS had briefly stopped sharing data on pollution sources in Delhi.
Sources in CAQM said DSS was still in the developmental state and hadn't been fully commissioned. ""A project evaluation committee is reviewing DSS periodically because its data and accuracy were not in line with the terms of reference decided for the model. Some data used by the system or emission inventory was quite old. DSS has also been asked to update its weather forecasting techniques or methodologies,"" said a CAQM official.

The official added that air pollution sources and emission patterns over the years in the entire NCR, as well as the weather forecasting techniques, needed to be updated in DSS. The system is being evaluated and will be resumed after changes are introduced to improve its accuracy, said the sources.
According to DSS's website, the region and source-wise contributions are based on the emissions inventory formulated in 2021. ""For a more accurate estimation of source contribution, the latest emission fields are required,"" says DSS's website.

An IITM official confirmed that the system was being reviewed by an expert committee. ""DSS was commissioned along with the early warning system in 2018, and it was then capable of calculating the share of biomass burning in Delhi's air quality. However, after CAQM was formed, the commission in 2021 funded the project for calculating other sources impacting Delhi's air quality,"" said the official, who, however, offered no clarity on when this system will become operational again.
Experts emphasised that source apportionment data was needed to prepare strategies and reduce air pollution at the source level. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, ""Dynamic forecasting of the relative contribution of pollution sources and real-time assessment of the contribution of pollution sources to the city's air quality are critical for responsive and transparent decision-making, science-based air quality management, and tracking progress. Public investments in these systems need to be upscaled and not become wasteful.""
Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst, Envirocatalysts, added that by withholding data, DSS risked further erosion of the already minimal transparency in identifying pollution sources. ""This lack of openness undermines accountability and hampers effective action against pollution. Decision-makers must leverage available data and tools like DSS, real-time source apportionment studies, and other systems to address pollution. Failing to do so wastes public resources, scientific efforts, and critical time needed to combat pollution effectively,"" remarked Dahiya.

Officials said 90,759 registered workers will be treated as the tentative beneficiaries for the one-time allowance as ordered by the Supreme Court.

The amount will be deposited in the Aadhar-seeded bank account of the beneficiary. Before releasing the amount, physical verification will be done.
Delhi govt provided a subsistence allowance of Rs 10,000 and Rs 5,000 to the construction workers during the first and second lockdowns in 2020 and 2021.
Officials said that the tentative beneficiaries of the financial assistance now are registered with the board based on self-certification that they worked for 90 days as construction workers in the preceding year. ""The authenticity of the self-certification was not verified at the time of registration of the workers. A bilingual link for the verification of construction workers has been provided on the web portal through which they can provide details for verification,"" said an official.
Sunil Aledia, executive director of the Centre for Holistic Development (CHD), however, claimed that contrary to the high court's earlier stance on inclusivity, the welfare board identified 90,759 registered workers as beneficiaries, but excluded workers whose membership had lapsed, although they may still be working in the city and were affected by the ban. ""The board's actions underscore ongoing gaps in extending relief to all affected workers,"" Aledia said.

Delhi's air pollution has been an annual affair with the onset of winter, resulting in curbs on old vehicles and closure of schools.
Speaking at an event on 'Energy Transition and Sustainable Road Transportation', Gadkari said, ""This city is like that. If I come for two days, I catch infection. Har baar Delhi me aata hua, aisa lagta hain ki jaana chahiye ki nahi. Itna bhayankar pollution hai (Every time, while coming to Delhi, I think whether I should go or not because pollution levels are so high).""
Referring to a report, Gadkari said severe air pollution badly impacts lives of people in the capital. ""Still there is not that much awareness among people,"" he said. Gadkari said large-scale migration from villages to cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata have resulted in multiple problems. ""At many places you see water flowing in Delhi, but it's only sewage water,"" he added.
The minister said the best way to reduce pollution is to bring down the consumption of fossil fuels and use of bio-CNG and other alternate fuels that are clean.

Besides raising concerns over air pollution, Gadkari also referred to the four legacy municipal waste dump sites, sarcastically terming them as ""tourist spots"". ""This is shameful for the city. I tried for four years to utilise the processed materials from these sites for highway projects. But agencies concerned raised several issues, including the segregation of wastes. We have made some progress and utilised around 80 lakh tonnes of segregated and processed waste in
highway projects,"" he added.
The minister said he held a meeting with the Delhi municipal commissioner and other officials on Monday. The MCD has invited bids for segregation and processing of waste and keeping them at specific locations.

Vitthal Baral, a resident of Punawale, said his five-year-old son was diagnosed with asthma last month. The doctors told him air pollution was one of the main reasons. ""The dust problem is a serious issue now. I face it every day while going to drop off my son to school. I do not blame anyone but the administration, because their inaction is causing serious health issues for our children,"" he said.
Baral said Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) vehicles are a rare sight and, as such, roads almost never get cleaned. This despite repeated complaints through the civic online grievance portal PCMC Smart Sarathi.
Earlier this year, PCMC had launched 16 vehicles for mechanical sweeping of roads. However, these are only used for main roads.

Another resident Nitesh Kumar said, ""Senior citizens are also facing respiratory issues. Movement of construction vehicles continues throughout the day and tyres of these vehicles are not cleaned with jet sprinklers as mandated.""
Resident, Naresh Kumar, said, ""Construction firms are not bothered. During peak hours, it feels like I am driving through a desert storm.""
The problem is not limited to Punawale. Similar issues are being reported from Chikhali and Moshi. Sanjeevan Sangle, chairman of Chikhali Moshi Cooperative Housing Society Federation, said he will write a letter to PCMC and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), demanding action against construction firms for non compliance. ""We have received several complaints,"" Sangle said.

Ajinkya Yele, assistant municipal commissioner and head of PCMC's health department, said, ""Mechanical sweeping machines are used to clean roads more than 18m wide, while the rest are cleaned manually.""
A senior PCMC official said, ""The building permission department takes action against construction firms that violate norms. However, we are also forming a dedicated squad that will report to the environment department and ensure strict enforcement of norms.""

Letters of acceptance were issued to the contracted agencies last week and the agencies are currently in the process of submitting bank guarantees, which need to be done before work orders can be issued.
However, implementation of GRAP stage IV, which restricts construction activities to curb air pollution, will not allow any immediate groundwork.
Even if GRAP measures are eased, the project will remain stalled as extreme winter is unsuitable for road recarpeting work as rapid cooling of the bituminous mix prevents proper compaction and bonding. Low temperatures hinder adhesion between bitumen and aggregates, leading to weaker surfaces prone to damage. The moisture from fog also affects the binding process.

""Agencies have been awarded special repair works of the master roads and service roads covering over 80km. They are in the process of submitting bank guarantees and once the process is complete, they will start mobilising manpower and machinery. While challenges like GRAP and weather conditions are there, procedural requirements must be followed and we are confident that the works will be completed within the stipulated timeframe of 9 months after works orders are issued,"" a senior official of GMDA said.

The works were initially supposed to begin earlier this year, but before GMDA could issue the tenders, dates of Lok Sabha elections were announced, and the model code of conduct (MCC) came into effect. This delayed the process till June, until the election results were announced, as no new projects could be undertaken before that.
GMDA floated the tenders for road repairs and revamp in mid-June, but before contracts could be awarded, the dates for Haryana assembly elections were announced in Aug. The projects got financial approval from the govt only in Nov.
This delay in commencement of the repair works has caused inconvenience to commuters, especially those of the new sectors.
Praveen Malik, president of United Association of New Gurugram, said, ""Most of the roads in sectors 81-95 haven't been repaired for nearly a decade, despite our repeated complaints. GMDA officials are aware that no road works can be started till Feb end. They should at least fill up the potholes on these roads to ease the suffering of commuters. Broken roads are also adding to dust pollution in the vicinity.""
Among the projects pending are repairs of stretches between Krishna Chowk to Rezang La Chowk and Mahavir Chowk to Atul Kataria Chowk. The New Railway Road, Old Railway Road, and Civil Lines Road, master roads for new sectors including 90-93, 92-95, 91-92 and 92-95 among others along the Dwarka expressway and inter-sector roads are to be repaired as well.

The implementation involved a newly developed software system designed to monitor air quality and generate advisories when pollution levels exceed designated thresholds.
The system's activation marked a proactive step in addressing the city's air quality challenges. ""We put the GRAP software in use on Tuesday. However, advisories will only be sent to relevant stakeholders when the Air Quality Index (AQI) exceeds 200. Once triggered, automated emails will specify the actions required to combat the situation,"" explained a senior official from the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB).
Although Kolkata and five other ""non-attainment"" cities in Bengal rarely experience AQI levels severe enough to invoke the highest GRAP stages (III and IV), the plan provides a dynamic framework. Actions under GRAP's Stages II, III and IV are designed to activate preemptively based on daily meteorological forecasts from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), ensuring timely intervention.
Under GRAP, KMC submitted a detailed report urging coordinated action from various departments. For instance, curbing the use of diesel generators in urban areas, cracking down on grossly polluting vehicles and ensuring adherence to emission norms. This collaborative approach aims at creating a unified front against air pollution and protecting public health.

GRAP has been customised for six cities in Bengal: Kolkata, Howrah, Barrackpore, Haldia, Asansol and Raniganj, each with specific measures and responsible agencies. While many actions remain uniform across cities, local issues dictate unique interventions. For instance, Raniganj, an industrial hub, faces persistent air quality issues due to industrial emissions, road dust, vehicular pollution, construction activity and transboundary contaminants. Winter exacerbates the situation, as temperature inversions trap pollutants near the surface.

Restrictive measures under GRAP are cumulative, meaning actions from earlier stages remain active when higher stages are invoked. For example, Stage III restrictions will include those from Stages I and II to ensure comprehensive mitigation.
The GRAP framework integrates with existing state initiatives and baseline policy measures to ensure a cohesive approach to improving air quality. By considering local conditions, the plan aims to address the unique challenges each city faces while fostering a state-wide strategy for cleaner air. As Kolkata takes the lead in implementing GRAP, stakeholders anticipate more efficient air quality management and reduced pollution levels in the coming months."

The air pollution in Bhopal was over 100 AQI more than during Diwali. The air quality index of Bhopal has been on a constant rise since Diwali. The AQI of Bhopal on Diwali night was 176.
Experts pointed out that air pollution increases during this time of the year not only due to firecrackers but also due to other factors.

Bonfires during winter contribute to air pollution. Pollution levels decrease during rains but increase afterward due to damaged roads and other activities, and the burning of bonfires make it worse.
Experts also noted that apart from local factors like people burning tyres and plastic during cold nights, which lead to increased pollution levels, the weather also plays a role in air quality. Meteorological department officials said that during this time of the year, winds from Punjab and Delhi blow over the state, which can cause the air quality index of MP cities to increase by up to 20%. Another reason is that air pollutants come closer when the temperature falls. From the mid-troposphere, they move to the low troposphere, leading to an increase in pollution levels.
Showers do wonders for air quality. The reason why air pollution decreases during rains, experts pointed out, is that dust becomes heavy in showers and does not fly in the air. Vehicular pollution also decreases as tyres do not cause air pollutants and dust to fly in the air, as it settles on the ground. This is why pollution levels decrease during rains. Officials said that apart from the damaged roads, flying dust from vehicles and increased construction activities lead to an increase in pollution levels."

Pandey further said that he has the best equipment to measure the air quality in Madhya Pradesh and therefore, he can say with certainty that air quality in areas like Hamidia Road, Bharat Talkies, Budhwara Square, Jawahar Chowk, and even MP Nagar would go beyond 200 to even 600 on certain occasions during the day when traffic density is more or where there is more dust because of traffic or construction. ""Since the vernacular media doesn't raise the issue of air pollution strongly and would rather be content with the data given by the MP Pollution Control Board, there is a lack of awareness among people on the kind of air that is going into their body, and that's why they are not using protective devices against PM 2.5 and PM 10 particles making their way into their body through air,"" said Pandey.
People, in general, may not be using devices like air purifiers, but some of them, both among the youth and the elderly, can be seen, particularly after the Corona pandemic, wearing masks as if it has become a part of their outfit like a shirt and trousers. ""Touchwood, Corona is gone, but many of us are persisting with masks since the air we breathe is not pure either.

There are also people like Pawan, who runs a small hotel in Arera Colony, who doesn't wear a helmet for protection from a road mishap so much as protection from dust and air pollution. ""I don't feel like wearing a helmet for protection while driving. I hardly drive during the day, but whenever I am on the road, I wear a proper helmet because it saves me from pollution,"" he said while talking to TOI.
A girl hosteller in a university, on the condition of anonymity, said that they never thought of buying something like an air purifier, but some of us did buy dehumidifiers since the walls of our hostel rooms leaked and smelled during the rainy season.

It was also the highest polluted Nov for the city since 2017, according to a new report by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).
After Delhi, the highest pollution was seen in Ghaziabad, followed by Hajipur, Bahadurgarh, Gurgaon, Noida, Hapur, Sonipat, Byrnihat and Bhiwani. All cities, barring Hajipur in Bihar and Byrnihat in Meghalaya, are from Delhi-NCR.
The report, which was released on Tuesday, stated that stubble burning contributed an average of 19% to PM2.5 levels in Delhi in Nov, but the elevated PM2.5 concentrations point to significant year-round sources. ""This emphasises the need for a comprehensive long-term strategy that targets pollution at its roots, rather than relying solely on short-term winter measures,"" said the report.
Though the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) was in force, the Decision Support System reported that the transport sector's contribution to Delhi's PM2.5 remained at least 20%, similar to non-GRAP periods. ""It raises concerns about the effectiveness of GRAP's on-ground implementation,"" said CREA.

Despite GRAP measures, a significant reduction in fire events (37,602) this year, and a lower contribution from stubble burning to PM2.5 levels, 28 cities in Delhi-NCR exceeded the limit of the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) this Nov. Only six out of these 28 cities were included in the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), which was launched by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change in Jan 2019 with an aim to improve air quality in 131 cities.

Delhi's PM2.5 concentration was categorised in the ‘severe' (over 250 micrograms per cubic metre) category for 10 days and ‘very poor' (121-250 micrograms per cubic metre) category for 20 days. The Nov average is 2.2 times higher than the Oct average of 111 micrograms per cubic metre. The daily NAAQS for PM2.5 is 60 micrograms per cubic metre. However, WHO's daily safe guideline is 15 micrograms per cubic metre.
Manoj Kumar, an analyst at CREA, said, ""While stubble burning counts have decreased, the consistent and growing contribution from year-round sources highlights the urgent need for continuous, year-round mitigation strategies. These efforts must adopt an airshed level approach and be integrated into the NCAP framework.""
Kumar added that proactive measures that reduce pollution at the source must be included under GRAP and fully implemented to avoid a recurring air quality crisis.
Except Chennai and Bengaluru, other megacities such as Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata exceeded PM2.5 NAAQS in Nov."

While a poor AQI zone is considered harmful for all upon heavy exertion, non-satisfactory air quality could hit the health of those who have lung or respiratory diseases such as asthma.
Ramesh Gokarna, a resident of Bandra (East) and his Andheri-based friend Pratik Damodar questioned the inefficiency on part of the administration in taking stringent action against polluting industries and in introducing dust-absorbing vehicles.

Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) officials have already announced that they will recommend local administrations to go for stringent action of closing polluting installations which have smoke chimneys and those emanating dust, such as construction-related activities across those suburbs with an AQI in the poor category.
MPCB has come out with a notification for ready-mix concrete plants to cover their premises entirely and use closed entry-exit curtains and covers for concrete/dust-carrying vehicles with water sprinklers to avoid the emanation of dust from them.
Last year, laundries and foundries in Kurla, ready-mix concrete plants, dyeing installations, and chimneys of gold and silver smelting units in Kalbadevi and Zaveri Bazaar were closed as part of action to curb air pollution. Also, the local administration had resorted to sprinkling water on major arterial roads.
An air quality index under 50 is considered as having ‘minimal impact’ on health; 51-100 satisfactory; 101-200 moderate or non-satisfactory; 201-300 poor; 301-400 very poor, which may cause respiratory illness to people on prolonged exposure; and 401-500 severe, which could harm even healthy people."

A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih took exception to a court-appointed commissioner being threatened for discharging his duty and sought an action-taken report from Delhi Police on his complaint. It said pollution levels kept rising between Nov 27 and 30, and decided to wait for a few days before relaxing the stringent conditions. The bench said it would take a decision on Grap restrictions on Dec 5.

Noting that Delhi-NCR invariably faces an air-quality emergency every year between Oct and Dec, the apex court said it would go into all aspects of the air pollution problem and find a permanent solution. It highlighted the ""complete lack of coordination"" among stakeholders, including Delhi govt, Delhi Police, Municipal Corporation of Delhi and the pollution control committee, in implementing the restrictions. The court also pulled up NCR states — Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana — for not taking steps to pay subsistence allowance to workers affected due to ban on construction work. It directed the chief secretaries of all NCR states to appear before it virtually on the next date of hearing.

“Only if we summon the top officers will the ball start rolling,” the bench said after counsel appearing for states pleaded that no order be passed against the chief secretaries.
“We make it clear that unless substantial compliance with actual payment of amounts to construction workers is reported, we will have to consider initiating action under the Contempt of Court Act against erring officers,” it said.
Taking note of advocate Manan Verma’s submission that he was being targeted for discharging his duty as court commissioner to report violations of Grap-4 measures, the bench asked additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati to brief the court about the action taken on his complaint.
The Commission for Air Quality Management had urged the court to relax the stringent conditions in view of prevalent air quality forecast but the bench turned it down. In an affidavit, the commission had asked the court to consider moving from Grap-4 to Grap-2."

Sulphur dioxide (SO2), a colourless gas with a pungent odour, is one such threat, and its concentration in our air is linked to respiratory tract and even cardiovascular disorders.
A recent satellite data study for Gujarat involving ISRO's Space Applications Centre (SAC) and nine researchers from five other institutes found 15 SO2 hotspots, including Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar, where levels were an average of 300 micromoles per metre square (µmol/m²).
The study — Identification of Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) Hotspots of Gujarat — was made using Earth observation satellite Sentinel-5P TROPOMI and published in the Journal of Geomatics. It uncovers alarming levels of SO2 pollution.
Among the 15 hotspots identified across Gujarat, Ahmedabad, the state's largest city, stands out. The research reveals that Ahmedabad experiences high SO2 concentrations, particularly during the winter and pre-summer months. The city's industrial landscape, reliance on fossil fuels, and dense urban fabric contribute to this alarming situation.

""The observed SO2 concentrations in hotspots in Gujarat vary between 10 to 1,000 µmol/m², with an average concentration of 300 µmol/m²,"" states the study. It also reported a minor drop during the Covid lockdown. The study used Level 3 Near Real-Time data from the Sentinel-5P TROPOMI satellite, accessed via Google Earth Engine.
This data includes SO2 vertical column number density, calculated using the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) technique. The researchers used monthly images from Jan 2019 to Dec 2023.

The researchers include Mehul Pandya of ISRO-SAC, Tejas Turakhia, Deepali Shah, Tejas Shah of GTU (Gujarat Technology University), Prabhav Singh of PDEU (Pandit Deendayal Energy University), Jay Vyas, Rajesh Iyer, Ruwaydahzehra Bukhari, Anand Chovatiya of St Xavier's College, and Aliya Kureshi of Sir PT Sarvajanik College of Science, Surat.
The research states that Ahmedabad faces significant SO2 pollution due to various sources. The city's numerous industries, including textile units and pharmaceutical factories, contribute heavily to SO2 emissions. Additionally, emissions from local transportation vehicles and a thermal power plant further elevate SO2 levels. Other contributors include rice processing plants, fruit and vegetable processing units, and even some bakeries.
On the other hand, the state capital Gandhinagar experiences notable SO2 pollution due to several factors, including the thermal power station and vehicular pollution. The average SO2 concentration in identified 15 hotspots across Gujarat can reach up to 1,000 µmol/m², with an average of around 300 µmol/m². Additionally, SO2 levels are significantly higher during the winter and pre-summer months. While the source provides a comprehensive analysis of SO2 hotspots in Gujarat, it does not specify the precise SO2 levels in each location within Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar.
According to a 2020 Greenpeace report, India is one of the largest emitters of SO2 in the world, contributing more than 15% of global anthropogenic emissions in 2019.

It’s a battle fought most intensely in low- and middle-income countries, where pollution-related health issues are quite common. To help us understand the depth of this crisis and practical steps to protect our health, Dr Pavny Chawla, a pulmonologist and sleep disorder specialist, shares necessary insights into the immediate and long-term impacts of air pollution, symptoms to watch for, and strategies to safeguard respiratory health.
Immediate and long-term health risks of air pollution

The effects of air pollution on our health can be devastating. It does not matter if the exposure was for a brief moment or a long time. In Dr Chawla’s words, “Even short-term exposure to polluted air can severely impact lung function, particularly for those with existing respiratory conditions.”
Types of air pollution

To understand the scale of the threat, it helps to differentiate between the types of pollution we encounter:
1. Ambient air pollution:
This refers to particles and gases in the outdoor air that come from sources such as cars, industrial pollutants, and agricultural activities.
2. Toxic chemical pollution: This type comprises chemicals emitted by manufacturing and agriculture, which frequently contain carcinogenic compounds.
Short-term exposure effects

Dr Chawla explains that even short-term exposure to high pollution levels can cause symptoms such as reduced lung function.
Increased asthma and COPD symptoms
An increased risk of pneumonia and bronchitis.
Allergic rhinitis and other allergies worsen.
An increased risk of cardiac events due to decreased blood vessel function.
Increased risk of stroke, particularly among postmenopausal women and men

Pregnant women face specific risks from pollution that should be very well known to everybody. ""Traffic-related air pollution has been linked to pregnancy complications like hypertensive disorders, premature birth, low birth weight, and even maternal and foetal health risks,"" according to Dr Chawla.

Long-term exposure consequences

Over time, long exposure to polluted air can lead to chronic health issues, which Dr Chawla describes as “the cumulative effect of breathing in toxic particles and gases.” Among these long-term risks are:
Chronic lung diseases like COPD, lung cancer, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis
Increased risk of developing colorectal and prostate cancers due to exposure to pollutants like PM2.5 and nitrogen oxides
Elevated risk of both respiratory and cardiovascular diseases

How to recognise the symptoms of poor air quality exposure

Given the dangerous and hidden nature of air pollution, Dr Chawla emphasises the importance of awareness. “If you’re experiencing symptoms like coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath, it’s essential to consider whether air pollution might be a contributing factor,” she advises.
Common symptoms to watch for include:
Persistent coughing and wheezing
Shortness of breath
Chest tightness
Palpitations and dizziness
Anxiety, as poor air quality can sometimes induce a feeling of unease or stress

How should one get a proper diagnosis and testing?

Dr. Chawla advises getting a medical checkup if you think your health is being impacted by environmental exposure. ""To evaluate lung health, doctors usually begin by going over your medical history, paying special attention to any exposure to air pollutants, and then proceed with pulmonary function tests (PFTs).""

Protective measures that could help minimise exposure on high-pollution days

When air quality indexes (AQI) soar, taking proactive steps can be life-saving. Dr Chawla provides essential tips for limiting exposure during high-pollution days.
Before heading outdoors

“Always check the air pollution forecast,” Dr Chawla advises. “It’s a simple step, but it can help you plan your day accordingly.”
On days when the AQI is high:
- Limit time spent outdoors, especially if you have respiratory conditions or are elderly.
- Avoid outdoor exercise, as it increases the volume of air—and pollutants—your lungs are exposed to.
- Use an N95 mask to filter out airborne particles if you must go outside.
Reduce indoor pollution sources

Indoor air can be more polluted than we would realise. Dr Chawla suggests minimising activities that generate indoor pollution:
- Avoid burning wood, candles, or incense sticks.
- Refrain from smoking or using hookahs indoors.
- Keep ventilation in mind, as this helps reduce the buildup of indoor pollutants.
Tips for improving indoor air quality

Consider purchasing an air purifier with HEPA filtration to extensively improve the quality of the air in your house. ""Especially in areas with little airflow, these devices are very effective at removing particulate matter,"" says Dr Chawla. She goes on to say that the best effects can be obtained by positioning the air purifier in areas like the living room or bedroom where people spend the most time. “For the purifier to be effective, keep windows and doors closed to prevent outside air from diluting the benefits.”

How effective are masks and air purifiers?

The effectiveness of N95 masks and air purifiers has gained attention as pollution levels rise. But how well do these tools work in practice?
N95 masks

“N95 masks are designed to filter out at least 95% of airborne particles, including fine particulate matter like PM2.5,” says Dr Chawla. However, she also cautions, “They’re only effective if worn correctly and do not protect against gaseous pollutants.” So, while N95 masks can reduce exposure to particulates, they might not be a complete solution.
Air purifiers with HEPA filters

Air purifiers can be valuable in creating a cleaner indoor environment. “Air purifiers with HEPA filters can capture particles as small as 0.3 microns, helping to reduce respiratory issues,” Dr Chawla explains. But keep in mind that their effectiveness depends on placement and regular maintenance, such as changing filters frequently.

Adapting outdoor exercise routines on high-pollution days

For those who enjoy outdoor exercise, high-pollution days can pose a dilemma.
Consider safer alternatives

Dr Chawla advises moving to indoor exercise on days with high pollution levels. ""Consider working out at a gym or doing home-based exercises, such as yoga or online fitness classes,"" she advises. Choose early mornings when pollution levels are usually lower if you must exercise outside.

Building long-term immunity with diet and lifestyle changes

Apart from immediate precautions, some necessary lifestyle adjustments can eventually help strengthen the body against the effects of pollution. The role of a nutrient-rich diet in strengthening the respiratory system is much more than we think.
Key nutrients to support respiratory health

Several nutrients that can protect the lungs and reduce inflammation:
Carotenoids (like beta-carotene and lycopene): Known for their antioxidant properties like carrots, bell peppers and spinach.
Vitamin C: Found in citrus fruits, it helps boost immune function.
Omega-3 fatty acids: Found in fatty fish, flaxseeds, and walnuts, these fats are anti-inflammatory.

Stop Ignoring The AQI Index: Long Exposure To Polluted Air Can Increase Your Risk Of Heart Attack

Recommendations for dietary changes

The doctor recommends adding some traditional ingredients known for their health benefits:
Ginger: A powerful anti-inflammatory
Turmeric (Haldi): Known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties
Green leafy vegetables: Rich in fibre and antioxidants
Fiber-rich foods: Whole grains and legumes support gut health and immunity

“These foods help counteract the oxidative stress caused by pollution, improve lung health, and enhance the body’s strength,” she explains.
With pollution levels continuing to rise globally, Dr Chawla stresses that taking steps to protect respiratory health is more important than ever. “It’s a combination of immediate measures, like using N95 masks and air purifiers, and long-term strategies, such as a healthy diet rich in anti-inflammatory foods.”"

The meeting, however, expressed satisfaction over the improvement in the air quality index (AQI) this year as compared to the previous year. Officials said the presence of small dust particles such as PM2.5 and PM10 at excessively high levels had been impacting the AQI level in the state."

GURGAON: The city recorded its coldest night of the season on Saturday, with the minimum temperature dropping to 10.5 degrees Celsius, slightly lower than Friday's 10.7 degrees. Despite the dip, the temperature remained a notch above normal for this time of the season.
A shallow fog enveloped the city in the early hours, reducing visibility to 800 metres, but it cleared quickly as the sun emerged. The afternoon was warm and pleasant, with the maximum temperature reaching 25 degrees Celsius, close to the seasonal average but slightly cooler than Friday's 25.9 degrees.
According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), a western disturbance will prevent any significant drop in minimum temperatures over the next 3-4 days. ""Night temperatures may rise by 1-2 degrees until Dec 4, after which north-westerly winds will bring cooler air from the Himalayas, leading to a gradual drop,"" an IMD official said.

NEW DELHI: It is indeed ironical that Delhi Police, in the name of implementing GRAP (Graded Response Action Plan), has set up barricades all over the city - a favourite pastime of our cops - in order to check if emission standards are being followed and whether vehicles that should stay off the road are plying.
Even as serious questions are being raised over maintenance of law and order in the city, our men in khaki can be seen manning barricades that have sprung all over the capital. Yes, Supreme Court did pull up the force and Delhi govt for not implementing the pollution curbs seriously. In fact, SC was more incensed about the entry of banned commercial vehicles not being checked on the borders. However, our cops seemed to have decided to atone for their lackadaisical attitude in a ham-handed manner, causing harassment and frustration.
In the past few days, commuters have been complaining that their journey time has gone up because the barricades are positioned in a such a way that they allow only one vehicle to pass at a time, resulting in long queues. One can imagine that if you run into three-four such barricades on one trip, it can cause a lot of delay besides anger and frustration.
What's worse is that the very emissions that you intend to curb are flaring up amidst the very gridlock that you have created.

According to a senior Delhi Police officer, 13 major pickets have been set up at the borders and 113 small pickets in the nearby areas. Besides this, all 15 districts now have 10 pickets each for the same purpose. ""All police stations are equipped with challan machines and we are conducting checking round the clock now,"" the officer said, adding that if they find any vehicle to be old, they stop it for checking the vehicle's documents.

Four men are deployed at each picket for one shift - i.e 12 cops for three shifts in 24 hours.
Their enthusiasm is not shared by commuters though. ""While coming from Ghaziabad, I take the Delhi-Meerut Expressway and then the Indraprastha Park T-point. In the past few days, there has been heavy congestion as the police have placed barricades at two locations in a 1-km stretch between the T-point and the Indraprastha flyover. Earlier, it used to take me five minutes to reach the ITO traffic signal but now that has increased to 10-15 minutes,"" said Dhananjay Sharma, a resident of Ghaziabad.
Alisha Juneja, another commuter, said: ""Just before the Vikas Bhavan signal, two barricades have been placed on either side of the road. Recently, when I was driving towards ITO on Vikas Marg, the car in front of me suddenly swerved left to avoid one of the barricades. I had to slam my brakes to prevent my car from colliding with it. I take this route every day, and I have no idea why those barricades are there. Most of the time, they're unmanned. On the rare occasions when officers are present, they simply stand there without taking any action. What's the purpose of these barricades?""
People have also been taking to X to express their frustration. One user, Prince, posted on X by tagging Delhi Traffic Police and Gurgaon Police: ""High traffic jam on MG Road at border towards Delhi due to barricades of police. It is a daily scenario here. Kindly look into it and help. @CPCB_OFFICIAL this is not helping to reduce pollution, it is actually contributing to the pollution only.""
Karan Singh, who lives in Noida, said: ""I was going towards central Delhi from Noida's Sector 25, a distance I usually cover in 45 to 50 minutes. However, it took me double the time because the whole of the Akshardham flyover was jammed. At first, I thought it was due to a breakdown, but realised they had placed barricades near Akshardham. The area in front of Akshardham is congested anyway, so what was the point of putting a barricade when no one was even checking or looking at the vehicles?""
A traffic officer said they have an app through which they can check the registration of vehicles. ""They also have a booklet with pictures of different vehicles and specifications to help identify those that are banned,"" the officer added.
Happy reading, Delhi Police! But won't technology do a better job?"

One of thing that is not spoken about however emerging in context and researches is antibiotic overuse and misuse. One of studies published in most reputed journal Lancet has proved that there is strong evidence that there are increasing risk of antimicrobial resistance with increasing levels of air pollution. The analysis published in lancet predicts high antibiotic resistance being reported globally can be due to air pollution. This finding can have a substantial policy and environmental implications by presenting a new pathway to combat clinical antibiotic resistance by controlling environmental pollution.
There can be several reasons for it:
1. Poor health status and antibiotic mismanagement

It is widely proven and known that pm 2.5 can cause bad health status, more chances of infection/infection like symptoms which may be throat irritation and respiratory difficulties which may cause health care provider to initiate antibiotics or in country like India where medicines are easily accessible causing more of self-use of antibiotics which in turn has the direct implication of causing antibiotic resistance. There has been substantial rise in antibiotic resistance infection in community which is multi factorial and one can’t negate the effect of air quality in causing more difficult to treat infections prevailing in community.

If everyone can notice these days even minor cough or infection is not settling with basic antibiotics and one has to escalate most of times indicating rising level of antibiotic resistance in the community.
2. ⁠Poor sanitation
Poor Sanitation, antibiotic overuse and superbugs goes hand in hand.
And the cities who are facing air pollution have been affected with air pollution also due to poor management of industrial waste/bad urban planning and even the socioeconomic disparities. India is developing on a very fast pace however still it is somewhere lacking on these fronts. People consumes antibiotics for trivial infection which may reach severe lines via excretion (urinary and stool) from where it may meet bacteria which can get “use to” the antibiotics as they are not in concentration to kill them but bacteria gets a glimpse of antibiotic and it’s like their drill to combat those antibiotics. As a basic survival instinct or any living organism nature has gifted the bacteria also to develop rescue mechanism of those substance/antibiotics which can kill it
3. ""Smart” bacterias adaptation in relation to pm2.5
Lancet study has proven that PM2.5 particles facilitates the horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance amongst the deadly bacteria’s like pseudomonas Kliebsella ecoli etc. it’s serving like tool for intercomunication for prevelance of antibiotics resistance.
4. ⁠Pollution has no boundaries and barriers facilitating local/regional
As air is free to move and can’t be stopped with any barrier or obstruction there can be locoregional distribution of pollutants and related infections which can expose the resistance bacteria of one region to places where bacterial resistance is not high. Hence, we are seeing as pollution gets increased the no. Respiratory infection cases also increases sometimes we encounter Durg resistance infection in priorly antibiotic unexposed individuals.
However, it is still debated if there can be intercontinental spread of pollutants and infection as most of PM2.5 are in denser zone and breathing zone and are not higher up in atmosphere so global spread is still looking not possible however still researches are being done of rising pollutant level and global spread which i feel in a long term it may have some effect on even global spread of resistance infection through air on the long term basis.
So, it is important to be on safer side and keep curtails on air pollution and also from clinical aspect to understand when to not expose the patients to antibiotics if infection is not suspected or for mild infection where body immunity will be able to contain it.
It’s time to take specific actions on enhancing immunity by good diet, rest and exercise in cleaner air to get saved from this antibiotic resistant bacteria menace.

Meanwhile, the Central government has introduced amendments to the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Rules of 2023 to address the problem of stubble burning. The new rules impose environmental compensation on farmers who engage in stubble burning.
As per the notification released by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate change, the central government aims to impose new rules to deal with the stubble burning in Delhi and surrounding areas.
Farmers with less than two acres of land will be charged Rs 5,000, those with two to five acres will pay Rs 10,000, and those with more than five acres will pay Rs 30,000. These measures are being implemented in response to the alarming rise in air pollution levels in Delhi and its surrounding areas, with the AQI frequently exceeding 400."

Despite the absence of official directives this year regarding precautions, some Delhi govt schools swiftly adopted strategies, drawing on lessons from previous years.
With air quality hovering in the ‘very poor' category and likely to get worse in the coming weeks, teachers and school staff say they are aware of the risks posed by exposure to particulate matter and other airborne pollutants. In response, some schools have started limiting outdoor activities, such as sports and physical education classes, which typically expose students to higher levels of air pollution. Instead, these activities are being moved indoors or replaced with more low-impact alternatives.
""We are minimising outdoor activities, particularly those related to the playground, as long as pollution levels remain high. We've also advised students to wear masks if they have respiratory issues, or simply if they prefer to when going outside,"" said Sunita, the principal of Ravishanker SKV in Bawana, northwest Delhi.

Similarly, in Noida, as air quality dropped to 'very poor' levels following Diwali, schools suspended outdoor activities, including sports and assemblies.
""It would be helpful if students wore masks, especially during the morning hours when the air quality is at its worst on their way to school. I've been advising them to do so, and we've also kept masks available at school for anyone who needs them,"" said Leena Sinha, principal of a govt girls' senior secondary school in Tughlaqabad.

In addition to limiting outdoor activities, Delhi schools are taking measures to reduce dust pollution on campuses. Water spraying is being done to control dust, particularly on windy days, ensuring a cleaner and safer environment for the students.
""We are making sure that sanitation workers use wet cleaning methods when students are present on campus. On the playground, our staff sprinkle water the night before to settle the dust before students arrive in the morning,"" Sunita added. ""We also held a meeting with the school management committee on Wednesday to monitor the burning of leaves or garbage in the surrounding neighbourhood, as this can further contribute to poor air quality.""
Many parents are uncertain about what's best for their children in the face of rising pollution levels, while others believe that all activities should be moved indoors. ""My child doesn't fully understand what bad air quality means. He's too young. He comes home upset because he wasn't allowed to play outside for long,"" said Laxmi, whose son studies in a govt school in south Delhi. However, Laxmi's sister-in-law, whose son is in Class IX, believes that keeping students indoors during this period of poor air quality will ultimately benefit their health in the long term.
Some school administrations believe that incorporating environmental awareness into students' daily routines throughout the year — not just during periods of poor air quality—will help them in learning how to care for the environment.
""It's crucial to instill in them an environmental consciousness from a young age, teaching students how they can actively contribute to the planet's well-being,"" said Joginder Kumar, principal of Government Co-Ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Sector-21, Rohini. ""For instance, students who arrive by rickshaw have started a pooling system as part of our efforts to combat pollution. Additionally, every student and teacher plants a sapling on their birthday and takes responsibility for its care. These may seem like small actions, but they are meaningful steps in addressing the environmental challenges we face.""
These independent actions taken by Delhi govt schools reflect the urgency of addressing air pollution.
By taking measures to limit exposure, they are setting an example of how communities can adapt in times of crisis to protect vulnerable populations, particularly children, who are more susceptible to the harmful effects of pollution."

The farm fire count in Punjab was down a steep 70% as compared to last year while Haryana saw a reduction of 42%. But here’s the rub: Data on different pollution sources in Delhi shows that farm fires continued to be a major contributor to the capital’s PM2.5 levels from late Oct to Nov.

How’s that possible? Experts said low stubble burning doesn’t necessarily me an the impact on Delhi’s air quality will be proportionately less. Intrusion of pollution from stubble burning into the capital depends on transport level winds and air ventilation conditions in Delhi.

If stubble burning counts are less, but north-westerly winds are consistently blowing in Delhi, the stubble burning impact would be more on capital's air. The impact of paddy residue burning events in other states would be more on Delhi if there is not proper ventilation for dispersion of the pollutants,"" said a senior scientist.
From Oct 23 to Nov 23 this year, the contribution of stubble burning was more than 15% on 26 days in Delhi's PM2.5. Of these 26 days, the share of farm fires was above 20% on 14 days. The season's highest single-day share in Delhi's air was seen on Nov 1 (a day after Diwali) at 35.2%, followed by 27.6% on Oct 31 and 26.2% on Nov 22, according to Decision Support System's data.

Last year, stubble burning mostly impacted Delhi's air from the last week of Oct to mid-Nov but there was stubble burning intrusion during the entire Nov this year due to meteorological reasons. The impact of crop residue burning was mostly negligible in Oct this year, except for a few days around Oct 23. Last season, the highest single-day share was 35% on Nov 3.
An analysis done by scientists at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, stated that paddy residue burning counts decreased in neighbouring states in the winter of 2023 as compared to the previous two years but its impact on Delhi's air quality was higher than in 2021 and 2022 due to meteorological conditions.

In the winter of 2023 (Oct 22 to Nov 30), the contribution of stubble burning was above 10% in 58% of days, more than 15% in 44% of days and over 20% in 30% of days. In contrast, the contribution of farm fires in Delhi's air was over 10% for 32% of days each in 2022 and 2021. The impact of farm fires in Delhi's PM2.5 was above 15% in 30% of days in 2021 and 18% of days in 2022. A similar analysis for the current winter season is underway.
Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, the contribution of farm fire to Delhi's air quality is variable and is highly influenced by the direction and speed of transport wind. ""While it is true that there have been days with significantly high contribution of fires to Delhi's air quality, there have also been several days when Delhi's pollution has been in very poor category even with minimal influence of farm fires, indicating high influence of local pollution sources. Farm fires need to be eradicated with significant reductions in other sources to clean up the air in the entire region,"" she said.
The model used by DSS to calculate the contribution of stubble burning in Delhi's air captures fire counts using the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) satellite. The model tracks fire counts in Punjab, Haryana, UP, Rajasthan, Delhi, MP, as well as in Pakistan, and also emissions released by burning of paddy residue. Depending on meteorological conditions, the model calculates the percentage share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5.
However, the VIIRS satellites overpasses India around 10.30 am and 1.30 pm. Some experts have pointed out that farmers in north-west India could be burning stubble in afternoon hours, after satellites have overpassed the region."

The city joined 30 others including Navi Mumbai, Vizag, Cuttack, Guwahati, Gwalior, Patna, Raipur, Chandigarh and Bhopal that reported increase in the level of annual average particulate matter (PM10) - a critical air pollutant - during that period.
All these 31 cities are in the list of 130 which are under National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), launched by environment ministry in Jan 2019 with an aim to improve air quality by reducing PM10 up to 40% by 2025-26 from the 2017-18 level or achieving the national standards during the period.
Incidentally, Navi Mumbai was the third ranker and Vizag fourth in the list of cleanest cities after Indore and Surat in 2023. This ranking is based on the cities performance in terms of their performance in sanitation and municipal waste management. On the air quality front, Vizag reported 58% increase (second worst in the list of 31) in level of PM10 in FY 2023-24 compared to FY 2017-18 while Navi Mumbai reported 11% increase during the period.
Surat, on the other hand, reported 21% reduction in the level of air pollutant in 2023-24 compared to 2017-18 but the city's PM10 continues to be much higher than the acceptable limit of 60 g/m3. Though both kinds of cleanliness - sanitation/waste and air - cannot be compared due to the very different nature of the problem, it shows that the efforts on one front may not make cities liveable unless air quality is also be taken care of by dealing with multiple other factors in neighbouring areas or in a region.

On a positive note, the comparative data on level of pollutant shared by environment ministry in the Parliament, shows 97 out of 130 cities have shown improvement in air quality in terms of annual average PM10 concentrations in FY 2023-24 compared to FY 2017-18.
Though 55 cities have achieved reduction of 20% or more during the period, most of them still reported higher level of pollutant than the acceptable standards. Varanasi turned out to be the best performer by reducing level of PM10 by 68%highest percentage reduction in the list of 97 - but the city still has higher level of pollutant than national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS).
Total 18 out of 130 cities conform to the national ambient air quality standards in terms of PM10 during 2023-24.

According to a bulletin issued by IITM, Delhi-NCR experienced predominant surface wind from the northwest direction with a wind speed of less than 8 km/h on Saturday. The wind speed is likely to reduce to 4 km/h on Sunday.
The mixing height was 1200 m, which is likely to decrease to 1000 m on Sunday. The ventilation index lower than 6000 m with an average wind speed of less than 10 km/h is unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants, it said.

These plants are suitable for planting along highways to help combat air pollution. The study was published in Springer Nature's journal Air Quality, Atmosphere and Health.
The 20 indigenous plant species shortlisted are: Oleander (commonly called pink Kaner), Saptaparna, Indian beech tree (commonly Karanj), Gray Mold, Ramphal, Castor plant, Neem, Ashoka, Kadamb, Peepal, Champa, Mango, Guava, Amaltas, Harsingar, Trumpet flower, Hibiscus, Fiery Costus, Chinar, and Earleaf Acacia.
Prof Narendra Kumar of the department of environmental science led the six-member research team, which screened the tolerance of these plants towards air pollution by considering their biochemical composition and socio-economic attributes.
Kumar explained that APTI categorises plants into three groups based on pollution tolerance (sensitive, intermediate tolerant, and tolerant). Plants in the 'tolerant' category have superior APTI values, indicating enhanced resistance to air pollution and suitability for urban pollution control. They retain suspended particulate matter efficiently between 40% and 80%. This means the dust-capturing potential (DCP) varied between 0.38 and 1.05 mg/square cm. The DCP varies with shape, size, and morphological features. Plants with broad leaves and rough surfaces are more effective in capturing dust compared to those with small and smooth leaf structures.

Plants with lower APTI scores serve as biological indicators of air quality due to their sensitivity to pollution. ""We have shortlisted plants that can be very effective in lowering air pollution levels based on their dust-capturing potential, their ability to sustain high pollution levels without adversely affecting their biochemistry, and their compatibility with the local environment based on their respective APTI scores,"" said Prof. Narendra.

He said that the findings supported the development of green belts along highways as a cost-effective and eco-friendly strategy for air pollution abatement. This study's recommendations may be used in policy formulation and practical implementation to ensure the development of urban green spaces, contributing to improved air quality and public health, he added."

These upgraded stations will be equipped to measure pollution sources using techniques like the chemical mass balance (CMB) receptor model, which is a mathematical tool used to identify and quantify the contributions of different pollution sources to the overall levels of pollutants at a specific location.
The state is planning to conduct real-time source apportionment studies as well. As part of the studies, vans will travel to various districts to capture a wide range of pollutants, including PM10, PM2.5, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, ozone, volatile organic compounds, black carbon, elements, and secondary inorganic aerosols.
""A tender will be issued for the operation of two mobile vans costing around Rs 20 crore. We will have more clarity over where the pollutants are coming from by next winter as by then, we are likely to have the real-time source apportionment vans. These vans will be sent to different locations for carrying out the study and analysing the data,"" he said, adding that two vans are enough for the purpose as sources of pollution are not going to change rapidly across the geography of the state.
""Data will be continuously collected and analysed. This will help us develop targeted strategies to reduce emissions and improve air quality,"" he added.

Meanwhile, the upgraded air monitoring stations will track pollutants such as PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, Benzene, Toluene, and Xylene. They will also analyse the collected PM10 and PM2.5 samples for their elemental composition, ions, elemental carbon, organic carbon, PAHs and other source-specific molecular markers.
The CMB model compares the ambient data with the source profiles and quantifies the contribution of each source to the observed pollution levels. This helps in identifying which sources are the most significant contributors to air pollution in each area.

""We have not yet identified which air station will be modernised, but this model is useful for localised air quality issues and has been used in regulatory applications to develop strategies for reducing emissions and improving air quality. We will have to rope in an international agency for this,"" said Nirmal Kashyap, head of air cell, HSPCB, Haryana.
Every winter, the air quality in Delhi-NCR plummets to dangerous levels as the region is enveloped by a blanket of toxic haze due to a combination of falling temperatures and rising emissions. Farm fires also contribute significantly to the pollution during this period. The source appropriation study's findings will guide authorities in forming policies to combat air pollution.
Currently, two such studies are underway in the state -- one for Faridabad, by TERI, and another for Gurgaon, Sonipat and Panipat, by Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI). While the TERI study is complete and its data being analysed, the study by ARAI, which started on Feb 1 last year, is likely to be complete by Feb 2025.
Two similar studies have already been conducted in Delhi, one by IIT Kanpur in 2010, and the other by National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) in 2019."

A high amount of toxins, such as nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide, sulfur, etc., present in the air not only impacts the vital organs in our body but also affects our eyes. Too much exposure to toxic air can lead to redness, burning, itching, watery eyes, blurry vision, Infection in eyes and eyelids.
While there is no option to keep yourself from being exposed to the open air, you can protect your eyes by understanding the risks associated with pollution and taking necessary measures. Since our eyes are highly sensitive, it is imperative to take extra care of them.
Exposure to polluted air, both indoors and outdoors, can cause numerous eye issues and can make pre-existing conditions worse. It can be responsible for severe allergic conjunctivitis, eyelid infections and dry eyes. Air pollution can aggravate glaucoma and cause ocular hypertension. Additionally, polluted air can also cause a rapid increase in incidences of cataracts and age-related macular degeneration. In long time, it may cause retinal degeneration and may increase the frequency of eye cancer.

Kolkata: As the season of air pollution sets in, majority of morning walkers and fitness enthusiasts in Kolkata have changed their ways — be it by curtailing the jogging hours or altering their routes — to protect themselves from the rising levels of particulate matter in the air. Such alteration comes at a time when health professionals in the city have advised those with asthma, COPD or existing heart ailments to avoid morning walks.They have also cautioned fitness enthusiasts to avoid strenuous exercises early morning and late evening when air pollution is at its peak .
Kolkata's Air Quality Index (AQI) had been poor before turning moderate over the past two days. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) consultant Arindam Biswas pointed out that harmful pollutants like cadmium, mercury, sulfur and carbon dioxide particles emitted by vehicles persist in the early morning air.
Morning walkers like Rajesh Chowdhury (57) — a regular at Victoria Memorial — have opted for schedule change. ""Until a few days ago, I would start my walks as early as 5am. Now, I have been coming after 7am when the situation (pollution level) is slightly better,"" said Chowdhury.
Many have even changed their routes, opting to walk only inside parks and gardens amidst a cover of trees to minimise exposure to toxic air. ""Vehicular pollution and fumes from open ovens are less inside the park, which makes it easier to breathe while walking there,"" said Tuhin Ray, a member of the Tala Park Morning Walkers' Association. Reducing the walk duration, some are also turning to free-hand exercises. Fitness freaks like Aditi Shaw, a homebaker, city are completing their daily step counts either at home or hitting the gym.
""For the past few days, the air has been thick with smog, and it is very difficult to breathe,"" Somendra Mohan Ghosh, an emission expert and a morning walker himself, said.

With AQI 312, Hajipur's ambient air was in the ""very poor"" category on Friday, worsening from the ""poor"" (298) on Thursday. However, Biharsharif's air quality improved to ""poor"" (AQI: 261) on Friday from ""very poor"" (348) on Thursday.
Particulate matter (PM) 2.5 was the prominent pollutant in all the cities, while PM 10, in addition to PM 2.5, worsened the situation in Patna, said the CPCB report. AQI of Ara and Darbhanga could not be evaluated on Friday due to unavailability of data.
Several factors are causing the air quality to worsen in the state after the onset of winter. Wind—both heavy or dense cold—are making the air unfavourable for citizens. Denser cold air, which moves at a slow pace in comparison to warm air, holds the impurities or pollutants and makes them remain suspended in the same place for longer duration which is breathed by humans.

The deteriorating air conditions have sparked health concerns among residents, with many reporting issues such as difficulty breathing, eye irritation, and skin problems.
One resident shared their frustration, stating, ""It has been many days since this problem has been going on. It has deteriorated over the last few days. The labor workers have been suffering a lot because of this... the government has failed to take any step.. we want to get rid of the pollution.""

Another local spoke about the challenges of living in the city, saying, ""Our eyes are burning.. it is getting difficult to breathe with each passing day. The pollution has increased a lot. There is barely any visibility; it is becoming difficult to live here with every passing day.""
Thick smog was observed in various parts of the city, including Kalindi Kunj, India Gate, Akshardham Temple, and ITO Road, further underlining the severity of the situation.

The Delhi EV policy offers a range of incentives, including a 25% purchase subsidy (up to Rs 5,500) for e-cycles, Rs 30,000 for e-rickshaws and e-carts, Rs 5,000 per kWh of battery capacity (capped at Rs 30,000) for two-wheelers, and Rs 30,000 for e-light commercial vehicles.
Atishi claimed the latest decisions were part of her govt's effort to tackle the city's severe air pollution and encourage the adoption of clean transportation. The CM said, ""The policy has been extended until March 31, 2025. I urge all Delhi residents to purchase electric vehicles in large numbers so that we can fight pollution effectively. Delhi govt is committed to this war against pollution and the electric vehicle policy is a vital part of this effort.""

In order to increase the percentage of electric vehicles in Delhi to 25% by 2024, the EV policy was announced in Aug 2020. The policy was first introduced for a three-year period, but it was extended multiple times in the absence of a new one.
Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva said that before claiming success for her govt's schemes, Atishi should have done her homework to realise that her govt's doorstep delivery scheme was non-functional for the past six months. ""And the EV policy has failed, as people are not receiving cash incentives for vehicle purchases,"" he alleged. ""On the one hand, govt owes outstanding subsidies to EV buyers since Dec 2023, while on the other, there is no budget provision this year for further subsidy payments,"" he stated further.
Another decision approved was setting up a dedicated optometry training division at Guru Nanak Eye Centre, with plans to introduce a four-year bachelor's programme in optometry for aspiring students.

This season continued with the trend of biomass fires' decreasing contribution to the bad air. The bad days, however, aren't over yet. When the share of local and regional sources of pollution increases in Dec and Jan, the pollutants remain trapped, with dense fog, slow winds and low temperatures hampering the dispersion of pollutants.
An analysis of the Decision Support System's data done by the Centre for Science and Environment revealed that during the stubble burning season from Oct 24 to Nov 8 in 2022, the biomass burning was responsible for 14.5% to Delhi's PM2.5. In the same period, local sources accounted for 31% of the pollutants while NCR districts contributed 54.5%.
However, from Dec 1, 2022, to Jan 31, 2023, the share of stubble burning came down to almost nil, but the proportion of local pollutants and from NCR districts was, respectively, 33.6% and 39.8% in the period, with 26.5% being attributed to ‘other districts', which include the districts apart from the 19 in the NCR of Haryana, UP, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan and places across the border.
The Central Pollution Control Board's data shows that in Jan this year, there were three ‘severe' days and 27 ‘very poor' days in Delhi. The lowest AQI was 273 on Jan 10 in the ‘poor' range. Similar conditions prevailed in Dec 2023, with the month recording three ‘severe' days, including when the AQI touched 450 on Dec 23.

Among Delhi's local sources, the contribution of domestic burning of non-cleaner fuels to beat the cold and industrial pollutants was higher in Dec-Jan than in Oct-Nov.
Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, CSE, said, ""The character of the smog episodes changes during the later part of Dec and early Jan when the impact of biomass/stubble burning is nearly eliminated. Though the contribution of pollution from other sources outside Delhi continues to remain high, the relative share of the local combustion increases.""

She pointed out that while vehicles remained the top polluter, peripheral industry, domestic use of solid fuels and construction pollutants exist. This underscores the importance of prioritising vehicles, industry, solid fuels and all combustion sources for curbing. ""No city can meet the clean air target without minimising the regional influence on its air quality,"" said Roychowdhury. ""This requires upscaling of sectoral measures in the airshed to complement stringent local action.""
Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst, Envirocatalysts, said the air quality in Dec and Jan mostly hovered in the ‘poor' or ‘very poor' zone with the exception of a few days impacted by rain. Precipitation reduces the pollution concentration a bit for a few hours, thus reducing the daily averages.
""While lower temperatures, reduced wind speed, and formation of inversion layer traps the pollutant emissions near the surface and reduces dilution, the pollution level can still be tackled by reducing the emission load from contributing sectors. Transportation, power generation, industrial activities, construction, waste generation and biomass use for cooking and heating add to the high emission load,"" said Dahiya.
He added that the high pollution levels and the emission load could be reduced by regulating the operation of polluting industries and power plants as well as strict enforcement of laws and GRAP as short-term measures. ""Shifting the polluting energy sources for transport, power generation and industries to cleaner alternatives and using the most efficient pollution control technology at source in the longer term can ensure that we don't face the same hazardous air pollution year after year,"" he suggested."

On Thursday, Delhi saw the season's coldest night when the minimum temperature was 10.1 degrees Celsius, the lowest so far.
On Nov 21, the city recorded 10.2 degrees Celsius.
Forecasts indicate the minimum could fall below 10 degrees Celsius on Friday, before showing a slight increase of 1-2 degrees Celsius during the weekend.
Meanwhile, the air quality saw a slight deterioration over the day.
The AQI was 313 at 9am, which deteriorated to 324 by 3pm. The city's 24-hour average AQI reached 325 ('very poor') at 4pm, according to the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) daily national bulletin.

This was a deterioration from Wednesday's reading of 303 ('very poor').
Weather analysts noted consistent wind speeds of 10-12 km/hr during both days, but predict reduced speeds over the weekend due to an approaching western disturbance. ""The winds will slow down within the next two to three days, going calm. This will impact the air quality negatively,"" said an official from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
IITM's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi (EWS) has predicted: ""The air quality is likely to be in the Very Poor category from November 29, 2024, to December 1, 2024. The outlook for the subsequent six days: The air quality is likely to be in the Very Poor category.""
By 6pm, while most of the monitored air quality stations by CPCB were within the upper limit of the very poor category, Mundka was in the severe level with an AQI of 405.
IMD also reported shallow fog with minimum visibility of 600 metres at Safdarjung at 7.30am.
A notable decrease in minimum temperature has occurred over four days, influenced by cold northwesterly winds. Records show temperatures of 14 degrees Celsius on Nov 25, 11.9 degrees Celsius on Nov 26, and 10.4 degrees Celsius on Nov 27. Some stations registered even lower temperatures.
Lodhi Road recorded 9.2 degrees Celsius and Narela 9.8 degrees. Although Safdarjung typically experiences sub-10 degrees Celsius temperatures by the end of Nov, this year's decline arrived later, due to a delayed winter.
According to the records, Nov's lowest minimums were 9.2 degrees Celsius on Nov 23, 2023, 7.3 degrees Celsius on Nov 29, 2022, and 9.2 degrees Celsius on Nov 24, 2021, and 6.3 degrees Celsius on Nov 23, 2020.
Thursday's maximum temperature reached 27.3 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal and 0.3 degrees Celsius higher than Wednesday. Weekend forecasts suggest maximum temperatures around 25 degrees Celsius."

Various studies suggest that increasing levels of air pollution like particulate matter, dust, sulphur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide settle on the scalp and hair, which further results in breakage, damage and most importantly, hair loss.
How does pollution affect hair?

Pollution can have a detrimental impact on your hair in several ways. First, pollution particles are tiny but can accumulate on the scalp and hair, clogging pores and preventing the scalp from breathing. This buildup can interfere with the natural growth of hair. Additionally, pollutants contribute to oxidative stress, which can damage hair follicles, leading to hair loss. Pollution can also strip hair of its natural moisture, leaving it dry, brittle, and frizzy.

Mistakes to avoid,"Updated: Nov 30, 2024, 08:57 IST","Surprisingly a high percentage of the population suffers from vitamin D deficiency, despite India's abundant sunlight. This arises from a number of factors including lifestyle choices, environmental reasons and habits.
Exposure to sunlight is vital because it enables the skin to produce vitamin D, a nutrient essential for strong bones, a robust immune system, and overall health. Sunlight triggers the synthesis of vitamin D when UVB rays interact with the skin, making it a natural and efficient source of this crucial vitamin.

Beyond vitamin D production, sunlight boosts mental health by stimulating the release of serotonin, a hormone that enhances mood and combats depression. It also helps regulate the body’s internal clock, improving sleep quality. Sensible sun exposure for even a few minutes daily promotes physical and mental well-being.
A May 2024 cohort study from South India revealed the prevalence and patterns of vitamin D deficiency and its role in cognitive functioning
A cohort study published in Scientific Reports journal found that the urban adult population in southern India had an overall inadequacy of Vitamin D. "" Similar findings have been also observed in a previous study from northern India, where high levels of Vitamin D deficiency (91.2%) was reported in healthy adult population above 50 years of age,"" the researchers have said. The prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency ranges between 50 and 94% as reported from several community-based studies on Vitamin D in India, the researchers have said.
Case-control study done earlier this year at PK Das Institute of Medical Sciences, Kerala
A case control study of 50 women aged 30-34 years with lower back pain for more than 3 months found low levels of vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency diagnosed when Vitamin D level is <20ng/mL was found in 74% of cases and 48% of controls. Hence Vitamin D supplementation can be considered in women aged 30-40 years who come with complaints of chronic LBP. Also, Vitamin D levels should be measured in patients who come with such complaints, so that follow-up can be done regarding the same, the researchers suggested.
Here are a few common reasons why Indians lack in this essential nutrient
People do not spend time outside
Even in a land blessed with adequate sunshine, most Indians spend insufficient hours outdoors. Urbanization and indoor lifestyles have kept many indoors at home, office, or school for most of their day. And even if they do step out, they do so either during the early morning or late evening hours when UVB radiation that is vital for vitamin D synthesis is at a very low level.
Skin color
Individuals with darker skin, which is commonly seen among the Indian population, tend to have a reduced capacity to synthesize vitamin D. The presence of melanin, which offers protection from harmful UV rays, indicates that people with darker skin require a significantly longer duration of sunlight exposure in order to produce the same quantity of vitamin D that lighter-skinned individuals can generate in a shorter time frame.
Dietary habits
Vitamin D-rich foods are not a significant part of the traditional Indian diet. While fatty fish, egg yolks, and fortified foods are good sources, they are either consumed in small quantities or are not a staple for many Indians. Vegetarianism, common in India due to cultural and religious reasons, further limits dietary vitamin D intake.

Air pollution
Air pollution in many Indian cities blocks sunlight and reduces the UVB radiation reaching the ground. High levels of particulate matter in the air act as a barrier, making it harder for people in polluted areas to get sufficient vitamin D from sunlight.
Common mistakes to avoid to get more vitamin D from sunlight
Understand the role of sunlight
Many people underestimate the importance of direct sunlight for vitamin D synthesis. Spending time outdoors in the sun, especially between 10 AM and 3 PM when UVB radiation is at its peak, is crucial. However, excessive use of sunscreen or staying in shaded areas can negate the benefits. Balance is key—expose unprotected skin for 10–30 minutes several times a week, depending on your skin tone and location.

Some people stay indoors during peak sunlight hours or expose only small portions of their skin to sunlight. Effective sun exposure requires larger skin areas like arms and legs to be uncovered. Spending time outdoors during optimal hours can significantly improve vitamin D synthesis.
Use vitamin D supplements
People with limited sun exposure, particularly urban dwellers and the elderly, often fail to take vitamin D supplements. Regular check-ups and supplementation as prescribed by a doctor can help maintain optimal levels. Over-the-counter supplements should be taken cautiously to avoid overdose.

Vitamin D deficiency manifests in subtle yet significant ways, often impacting overall health. One of the most common signs is persistent fatigue and low energy levels, as vitamin D plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular energy and overall vitality.
Another prominent symptom is bone pain and muscle weakness. Vitamin D helps in calcium absorption, which is essential for strong bones. A deficiency can lead to soft, brittle bones and an increased risk of fractures, particularly in older adults.
Frequent illnesses and infections may also indicate low vitamin D levels, as it is vital for supporting the immune system. Individuals may find themselves falling sick often or taking longer to recover.
Additionally, mood changes, including depression, have been linked to low vitamin D. It influences serotonin levels, which regulate mood.
Finally, hair loss and slow wound healing could signal deficiency, reflecting vitamin D's role in cell repair and skin health.
How to maximise the exposure to sunlight
Aim for 10–30 minutes of sun exposure, preferably during midday. Expose larger skin areas like arms and legs without sunscreen during this time. Use sunscreen after achieving sufficient exposure to prevent skin damage.
Choose lighter, sun-friendly clothing during outdoor activities to maximize skin exposure.
Add items like fortified milk, cereals, mushrooms, egg yolks, and fatty fish to your diet. Vegetarians can focus on fortified plant-based alternatives.
If sunlight and diet are insufficient, consider taking supplements after consulting a doctor.
Check air quality in your area. Opt for outdoor activities in cleaner environments or take supplements if pollution is high.
Periodically test your vitamin D levels, especially if you belong to a high-risk group, such as the elderly, people with darker skin, or those living in polluted cities."

The Union ministry of environment has cleared several ethanol projects based on grain and sugarcane to support the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) programme. Most of the proposed plants in Telangana and Andra Pradesh are grain-based. According to Scientists for People, an environmental advocacy group, the environmental clearance documents for these projects list only boiler emissions from coal or biomass combustion, omitting process emissions from ethanol production itself.
Citing studies in the United States, retired chief scientist of Indian Institute of Chemical Technology Babu Rao, a key member of the group, said grain-based ethanol plants release hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) such as acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, acrolein and hexane. These chemicals, known to cause health issues ranging from respiratory irritation to cancer, were identified in research conducted by the University of Nebraska in 2019 and 2020. The studies used biotrickling filters (BTFs) to control emissions from ethanol plants and quantified the pollutants, he said.
He emphasised the risks posed by these pollutants, stating their low odour threshold values meant they can be detected even at minimal concentrations by nearby communities. He said that acetaldehyde is classified as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans"", formaldehyde as ""carcinogenic to humans"", and acrolein as ""probably carcinogenic to humans"", according to international classifications. Exposure to hexane can cause severe neurological effects, including numbness, tingling and weakness.

The group said the omission of these pollutants from environmental clearance reports in India exposes rural communities near ethanol plants to considerable health risks.
""The experts appraising these projects seem to lack full knowledge of the environmental hazards involved. Their decisions appear to be influenced by political agendas rather than scientific evidence,"" Rao said
The group also questioned the credibility of the Ethanol Blended Petrol policy, asserting that it relies on incomplete or flawed scientific data.

The highest AQI in Oct was 364 in the ‘very poor' category on Oct 23. The air quality is likely to hover within the ‘very poor' category till Wednesday. IMD has predicted that mist or smog conditions during the early hours of Monday to Wednesday.

Experts said the wind direction has been changing from north-westerly to south-easterly on Sunday, and wind speed dropped to zero during the transition phase.
Even the night temperature, which mostly remained at least 3-4 degrees above normal in Oct, has now started dipping in Nov. On Sunday, the city recorded the season's lowest minimum temperature at 16.5 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. It was a dip of around four degrees as the minimum temperature settled at 21.1 degrees Celsius on Oct 31.

""As the wind direction is changing to south-easterly, winds turned calm during the daytime, causing accumulation of pollutants. Variable winds blew in the city in the last 24 hours, but south-easterly winds are expected to prevail on Monday and Tuesday. Though south-easterly winds are unfavourable for the transport of emissions from stubble burning to Delhi, local winds are expected to be calm during the night and light during the daytime. Since local winds will not pick up in the next two days, it is likely to impact the air quality,"" Mahesh Palawat, vice-chairman of Skymet Meteorology, said.
As the winds turned calm during the daytime, the AQI spiked from 366 at 8 am to 382 at 4 pm based on the average calculated by CPCB of 39 stations out of a total of 40. The AQI reading surpassed 400 at 14 stations, placing them in the ‘severe' category. This included Anand Vihar, the most polluted with an AQI of 436, followed by Nehru Nagar at 430 and Punjabi Bagh at 425.
""Meteorological conditions are likely to be extremely unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants,"" the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi (EWS) said on Sunday. The EWS added that the air quality is likely to remain in the very poor range till Wednesday, but it is forecast to stay in the ‘very poor' to ‘severe' category during the subsequent six days from Nov 6 onwards.
The share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 was 14.96% on Saturday, according to the Decision Support System. However, as south-easterly winds are likely to blow in the city, the contribution of stubble burning is expected to decrease. Satellites detected 351 residue burning events on Sunday. Of these, 216 were in Punjab, 19 in Haryana, 16 in UP, 36 in Rajasthan, and 67 in MP, according to satellite data compiled by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute."

This uncommon kind of pneumonia, which is mistaken for a chronic flu or cold, is gaining attention due to its mild symptoms and links to worsening air pollution. Cities with poor air quality, such as Delhi and Mumbai, are experiencing an upward trend in cases, as doctors advise against neglecting long-term respiratory concerns. Here's all we need to know to understand walking pneumonia, its symptoms, and how to be safe during this health crisis.
What is walking pneumonia?

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the most frequent cause of walking pneumonia, frequently referred to as atypical pneumonia, which is a lung infection brought on by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The fact that those impacted are not restricted to their beds and may go about their daily lives is what gives it its name. This infection inflames your airways and fills the lung’s air sacs with mucus, leading to flu-like symptoms that are often mild but persistent.

Most cases occur in children aged 5-15 and adults under 40. Environmental factors, such as pollution, can worsen symptoms by irritating the lungs and making them more susceptible to infections. The higher the level of exposure to nitrogen dioxide the higher the risk of pneumonia.
How is walking pneumonia different from regular pneumonia?

Traditional pneumonia usually impacts only one side or specific areas of the lung which results in more severe symptoms such as high fever and substantial chest congestion. Walking pneumonia, on the other hand, has a patchy distribution across the lungs and produces milder symptoms.

But untreated walking pneumonia may lead to full-blown pneumonia, particularly when aggravated by factors such as poor air quality or decreased immunity.

What are the symptoms?

The symptoms of walking pneumonia are very much similar to those of a cold or flu, making it tricky to identify. Here are the common signs:
Low-grade fever (below 101°F)
Chest pain or tightness
Persistent cough
Fatigue and weakness
Sore throat
Headache
Chills
Occasional rash or sneezing

Treatment

If caused by bacteria, specific antibiotics are effective.
If it’s a viral infection, it’s self-limiting and usually requires symptomatic treatment like fever reducers and cough syrups.
Proper hydration, rest, and a healthy diet can aid recovery.
Patients with underlying conditions like asthma, COPD, or weakened immune systems may require more intensive care.
Is walking pneumonia contagious?
Yes, walking pneumonia is contagious. It spreads through droplets produced by an infected person coughing, sneezing, or even talking.
Bacterial pneumonia spreads by continued close contact.
Viral pneumonia is more contagious, lasting up to ten days.
Crowded environments and poor ventilation can hasten transmission, making masks and cleanliness essential."

MUMBAI: The city experienced a notable increase in air pollution Thursday, said an analysis by Respirer Living Sciences (RLS), a tech platform that monitors and analyses air pollution. “While most monitoring stations showed moderate increases, specific locations such as Sewri, Kandivli West, and Malad West recorded PM2.5 surges exceeding 70%,” it said.
The analysis covered data from 28 monitoring locations, mostly of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), in Mumbai using the AtlasAQ platform by RLS.
""There was a pronounced increase in both PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations across Mumbai, particularly in Mazgaon and Kherwadi, where percentage increases were exceptionally high. This could be due to Diwali celebrations, as these increases exceed standard daily variations, posing heightened health risks in affected areas. These findings suggest the need for targeted interventions to manage air quality, especially around festival times,"" the analysis stated.

“Diwali festivities undeniably highlight the impact of concentrated pollution sources on urban air quality. This year’s data underscores the need for proactive measures to mitigate such spikes, particularly in neighbourhoods with larger populations of vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, newborns, and the elderly. These groups particularly suffer during rapid increases in concentration as experienced during Diwali and a few days after that,” said Ronak Sutaria, CEO and founder of RLS.

""Mazgaon saw the most significant increase in PM2.5 levels, rising by a staggering 105.83% from Day 1 to Day 2, reaching 175.04 on Diwali. This was the highest recorded increase, showing how festive activities affected air quality. Kherwadi in Bandra East also experienced a substantial rise in PM2.5, increasing by 72.30% to 145.44 on Day 2, which is concerning given its already high baseline.

Navy Nagar in Colaba and Vile Parle West followed, with increases of 89.63% and 67.93% respectively, indicating a significant pollution spike in these areas.
Siddharth Nagar in Worli, though with a smaller percentage increase of 40.83%, still recorded a notable rise in PM2.5,"" it stated.
""Mazgaon again exhibited the largest increase in PM10 levels, with a remarkable 127.42% rise from Day 1 to Day 2, reaching 254.41. This spike reflects a critical degradation in air quality, likely influenced by Diwali activities. Kherwadi in Bandra East saw a 63.83% increase, with PM10 rising to 199.84, mar king it as another hotspot of pollution. Navy Nagar in Colaba experienced a 60.99% increase, reaching 216.32, consistent with its PM2.5 spike. In Vile Parle West, PM10 levels increased by 13.86%, showing a moderate rise compared to other locations, yet still significant. Shivaji Nagar showed a slightly higher increase of 5.12%, reflecting relatively stable but concerning pollution levels.”"

Jaipur: Like in past years, Diwali celebrations in Rajasthan have led to a significant rise in air pollution levels. The worst air quality was recorded at night in Bikaner and Jodhpur, where Air Quality Index (AQI) reached hazardous levels of 500.
On Thursday midnight, AQI peaked at 376 in Jaipur around midnight, though it improved to 244 by 9am on Friday due to the clear skies and strong sunlight. By 9am, different areas in Jaipur showed varied AQI levels: Adarsh Nagar, Raja Park, and Transport Nagar registered 181; Mansarovar, Ajmer Road, Gopalpura and Prithviraj Nagar had higher levels at 270; Sitapura, Vatika, Pratap Nagar and Jagatpura reached 323; Murlipura, Jhotwara, Kalwad Road and Niwaru Road reported 289. Shastri Nagar, VKI, Vidhyadhar Nagar and Ambabari recorded AQI levels above 224.
""On Saturday, too, AQI levels remained moderate and poor in many areas of Jaipur. Favourable weather conditions helped ease the pollution in the morning,"" said an official.
Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board (RSPCB) reported that AQI levels across the state, especially in cities like Jaipur, Ajmer, Bharatpur, Udaipur, Bikaner and Jodhpur, ranged between 400 and 500 by Thursday night, entering the ""severe"" zone. The air quality in the severe zone affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases.

The highest morning pollution levels were observed in areas near Delhi-NCR and Haryana, including cities like Sikar, Bharatpur, Bhiwadi, Jhunjhunu, Hanumangarh, Bikaner, Ganganagar and Jaipur, with AQI ranging from 200 to 350. Other cities like Udaipur, Bhilwara, Rajsamand, Kota, and Ajmer saw red-zone AQI levels at night, though these dropped to between 100 and 200 by morning, indicating moderate to poor air quality.

Medical experts warned of health risks, particularly for the elderly and those with heart or respiratory conditions. A senior doctor at SMS Hospital in Jaipur advised people over 65 and those with heart and COPD conditions to wear masks in the days following Diwali.
""The smoke from firecrackers and the dust from Diwali cleaning can lead to respiratory infections and exacerbate breathing issues. We recommend vulnerable individuals to stay indoors as much as possible during this period,"" he said."

According to official data, the particulate matter (PM) levels have seen an alarming spike of up to 100 times the recommended limits.
Localities worst affected are Gachibowli, Kokapet, Old City, Sanathnagar, Punjagutta, and Somajiguda.
The highest PM 2.5 levels in Sanath Nagar, for instance, reached 500 µg/m3 on Tuesday which is 100 times above the World Health Organisation (WHO) guideline of 5 µg/m3. Health experts likened this to smoking nearly 22 cigarettes a day.
Somajiguda recorded PM 2.5 levels of 280 µg/m3, while Kokapet, Kompally, and Ramchandrapuram reported levels exceeding 200 µg/m3.

""I have been living here for 15 years, but the winters have become worse. The air smells toxic, and I constantly worry about my kids' health, especially during their morning commute to school. Everyone in our house have either scratchy throat or cold,"" said Sameer Ahmed, a bank official and a resident of Sanathnagar
PM 10, another significant pollutant, has also been detected in hazardous quantities.
ECIL reported the highest PM 10 levels at 204 µg/m3, followed by Gachibowli (160 µg/m3) and Old City (158 µg/m3). These figures, environmentalists say, are worrisome considering WHO's recommended limit is just about 15 µg/m3.

PM 2.5 and PM 10 are fine inhalable dust particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less and 10 micrometres or less. A rise in their levels can lead to serious health implications.
""We avoid stepping out early in the morning because the smog is so thick. Even inside the house, we feel the air isn't clean. It's scary how this has become our reality not just in winter but all round the year now,"" said Kavitha Rao, a tuition teacher from Kompally.
‘Winter magnifying pollution problem'
This fear is amplified during the winter, say experts, explaining the phenomenon of ‘temperature inversion'. Padmaja K, a city-based air pollution expert said: ""At night, the ground cools rapidly, trapping cooler air under a warmer layer. This prevents pollutants from dispersing. Weaker winter winds further slow this process, allowing pollutants to accumulate. However, the winter season is only magnifying the city's persistent pollution problems.""
Experts suggest an array of measures to tackle the crisis. Strengthening public transport systems, promoting cycling and walking, phasing out old vehicles, and cracking down on adulterated fuels are key recommendations. Better traffic management and stricter monitoring of industrial waste are also essential.
""Construction activities, a significant contributor to air pollution, need tighter regulation,"" said environmentalist R S Tummala. ""Simple actions like installing curtains around construction sites and sprinkling water to reduce dust can make a big difference.""
Tummala also stressed the importance of recycling systems and efficient effluent treatment plants. ""We cannot eliminate pollution entirely, but we can control it. Enforcing existing laws and penalising violators can significantly curb pollution and slow down the effects of climate change,"" he said.
Pollution deaths on the rise
The rising PM level is taking a heavy toll on public health, with doctors observing a marked increase in respiratory illnesses such as asthma, lung infections, and chronic cough during winter. Pulmonologist Dr Tejas Jogi emphasised the severe health implications, noting, ""Pollution-related health issues are increasing year-round, but they double during winter. These conditions can lead to severe complications and even death.""
Highlighting the grim reality, he added, ""Between 2008 and 2020, Hyderabad recorded an average of 5,552 deaths annually due to air pollution. In 2023, the city witnessed 1,597 deaths attributed to toxic air, ranking it the sixth deadliest city in India for pollution-related fatalities.""
Children with their developing lungs are particularly vulnerable. ""PM 2.5 particles penetrate deep into the lungs, weakening children's immune systems and increasing their risk of respiratory infections like pneumonia and bronchitis,"" Dr Jogi explained."
285,Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/construction-ban-in-delhi-a-yearly-crisis-for-workers-and-industry/articleshow/115707848.cms,"Year after year: Construction ban a blow to industry, workers’ livelihood","Nov 27, 2024, 00:13 IST","New Delhi: Citizens heave a sigh of relief when construction activities in the city are restricted whenever air pollution reaches a high. But cessation of work affects both the building industry's financial health and the labourers' lives. The constant disruption in work schedules, coupled with the challenge of frequently assembling a workforce, causes the project cost to balloon. Industry professionals point out that the pollution restrictions are now a yearly hiccup, and without effective long-term solutions the sector will always have to bear the adverse consequences.
Ramesh Menon, founder-director, Delhi Consortiums, a think tank, said that if year-round, result-based measures to curb air pollution were implemented, about 2% of the losses incurred due to the ban on construction and related activities could be averted. ""The absence of a master plan for each implementing agency in Delhi is the key reason for the failure to mitigate the problem. Even after facing the same circumstances every year, we are least prepared. Simply banning activities one by one is at best a temporary move,"" said Menon, who noted that whatever short-term and long-term measures have been adopted have produced some results.
Menon said that with the GRAP norms formulated after taking all stakeholders into confidence, no one could question the enforcement of these guidelines. ""But the big question is why does it happen every year? It's because we have no effective pollution plan in place. Banning construction activities won't reduce the pollution caused by dust on roads. Similarly, if illegal or unregulated constructions go on disregarding the pollution norm year-round, naturally the situation won't improve.""
Hemant Jain, president, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that the ban on construction activities disrupted not only the real estate and construction developmental activity but also the overall economic situation because of falling demand for infrastructural items including cement, steel and bricks. ""As the construction sector is the second largest employment provider, the economic well-being of the workforce, including skilled, semi-skilled, and unskilled workers, is also impacted. Ideally, pre-planned construction activity shouldn't be halted, only new building activities should be paused,"" suggested Jain.

An IIT Delhi study said last month that dispersed sources of pollution like unpaved roads, garbage burning, and waste dumping were major causes of air pollution in Delhi and account for 25-40% of pollution in north India. The study recommended that urban local bodies adopt the Dispersed Sources Programme (DSP) to improve air quality. CAQM implemented DSP in partnership with urban local bodies, but people claim these steps haven't proved effective.

Sources, however, claimed that CAQM was holding sectoral meetings and issuing necessary directions throughout the year, considering that air pollution is a problem even in summer. ""And even before the onset of winter, GRAP comes into force and actions under the various stages are implemented in right earnest by all the agencies concerned and strictly monitored by CAQM's GRAP sub-committee,"" said a source
Builder Sandeep Soni despaired about work at his six construction sites faltering for the past 15 days. ""70% of my labourers have left town. Once the restrictions are lifted, it will take me 10 days to bring them back. Besides financial losses, we also face harassment from people, who complain to the authorities even when minor repair, painting or lift installation work is going on,"" said Soni. ""We don't know how much planned construction is contributing to pollution, but certainly, there are bigger factors that are causing pollution but remain unaddressed.""
Narendra Budhiraja, who lives in Safdarjung Enclave, argued that govt should take concrete steps to help the daily wagers engaged in the construction sector when GRAP measures are implemented and they lose their work. ""Though my house is under construction, we respect and comply with the Supreme Court's orders,"" he claimed. ""We don't mind halting work for some time to contribute to dust mitigation. But what about the labourers whose livelihood depends on everyday salary? Also, why are these long-term plans not implemented strictly and in a committed manner?"""

MCD identified 367 sites measuring less than 500 square metres that failed to implement the specified dust control measures. While three sites were issued closure notices, the others were levied environmental compensation charges for the violations. At sites exceeding 500 sqm, 53 were found non-compliant or had failed to register on the mandatory. One was given a closure notice while the rest were asked to pay environmental compensation charges.
""In total, we inspected 4,181 construction and demolition sites in the 500 sqm category and found violations at over 350 places. We also visited 1,368 plots bigger than 500 sqm and discovered 53 sites violating CAQM guidelines or following norms, which is why environmental compensation was imposed.

The Air Quality Index (AQI) was 383 at 11am, 369 at 1pm, 353 at 3pm and 334 by 5pm.
By the late afternoon, due to better ventilation, most of the areas were out of the ‘severe' category. However, despite the improvement over the day, a thin layer of smog was visible as the air quality still was ‘very poor'.
The average air quality index (AQI) was 334 against 349 a day earlier. The city continues to be under GRAP-IV restrictions. Educational institutions are operating in the hybrid mode.

Weather analysts said that as the city saw good wind speed towards the afternoon, the air quality improved. They also said that a drop in the wind speed is expected and a moisture spike could happen from Nov 28 onwards.
""The wind speed went up to 15 kmph from 11am onwards and throughout the afternoon. This led to improvement in the air quality. However, the speed again dropped towards the evening. A western disturbance is expected to impact the region around Nov 29. However, a cyclone over the Bay of Bengal may also impact the region, which will bring moisture, and the wind speed may also slow down from Nov 28 onwards. Under those conditions, the air quality may deteriorate again,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice-chairman of meteorology and climate change at Skymet.
On Tuesday, the PM2.5 levels hovered between 189.2 to 148.1 micrograms per cubic metre, against the 24-hourly standards of 60 micrograms per cubic metre. The PM10 levels hovered between 306.9 to 250.4 micrograms per cubic metre, against the national standard of 100 units and the advised WHO standard of 45 units.
The air quality early warning system by IITM has also warned of ‘severe' AQI soon. ""The air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor' category from Nov 26-27. The air quality is likely to be in the ‘severe' category from Nov 28-29."" For the next six days, the air quality is likely to be ‘severe' or ‘very poor', the air quality early warning system has warned.
For Wednesday, the city may see smog to moderate fog in the morning hours with a wind speed less than 4 kmph, which could increase to around 8 kmph by afternoon.
However, the wind speed may drop again to 4 kmph by evening. According to the decision support system (DSS), on Tuesday, stubble burning contributed 6.99% against 11.13% on Monday to the city's net pollution while local transport caused about 17.53%.
On Tuesday, however, the contribution of local transport emissions spiked, causing 22.27% of local pollution while residential emission contributed 5.4%, industries 4.2%, construction 3.2%, and waste burning 2% of the city's net emissions. Among other cities, Jhajjar contributed to 8.2%."

Kolkata: City residents woke up on Tuesday to a thick layer of smog that lingered until late morning, reducing visibility and disrupting transportation across the city. While the Air Quality Index (AQI) slightly improved as the day progressed from ‘very poor' (301-400) to ‘poor' (201-300) for the first time this season, the lingering health impact raised significant concern, especially for those over 50.
The continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMSs) at Ballygunge and Fort William reported ‘very poor' air quality in the morning. Although Fort William's AQI dramatically improved as the day went on, Ballygunge saw only minor relief, with air quality moving from ‘very poor' to ‘poor' only late in the evening. Victoria Memorial and Salt Lake followed closely behind, with air quality remaining in varying degrees of the ‘poor' category.
Health experts cautioned against strenuous physical activities outdoors, emphasizing the heightened cardiovascular risk posed by inhaling pollutants. Preventive healthcare expert Debasish Basu said, ""Kolkata's AQI is dominated by PM2.5 particles. Due to their small size, these particles penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream, carrying harmful chemicals that exponentially increase health risks.""
The PM2.5 particles, a key component of Kolkata's air pollution, pose a severe threat as they bypass natural defences in the respiratory system. Prolonged exposure can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular complications, with senior citizens being particularly vulnerable.

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) classify AQI into five categories based on health impacts — good (0-50: typically during summer and monsoon in Kolkata), satisfactory (51-100: common post-monsoon), moderate (101-200: common in Oct and early Nov), poor (201-300: emerges with falling temperatures in late Nov), very poor (301-400: prevails in Dec) and severe (401-500: rare in Kolkata, but Delhi currently struggles under this level).

Meteorological factors such as slow wind speeds (below 2 metres/second) and temperature inversion have contributed to the rise in pollution levels, said Kalyan Rudra, chairman of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board. ""A sustained cloud cover and low wind speed create conditions for pollution to accumulate. Moreover, the trans-boundary movement of pollutants from neighbouring regions adds to the challenge,"" Rudra added.
He emphasized the need for regional rather than city-specific mitigation measures, highlighting how inter-state coordination could better address pollution."

Bhubaneswar: The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has directed the secretary, ministry of environment, forest and climate change, to examine concerns regarding air pollution and adverse climate change impact in Odisha, Delhi and other states. The commission issued the directive following a petition lodged by advocate and rights activist, Radhakanta Tripathy. The petition claimed that owing to systemic failures and inaction by Odisha authorities, the present PM2.5 concentration in the state exceeds the WHO recommended limit by 2.2 times.
""Odisha faces concerning developments as six cities within the state rank among the nation's 102 most polluted. Cuttack, Bhubaneswar, Balasore, Angul, Talcher and Rourkela have not maintained the national ambient air quality standards established by the Central Pollution Control Board,"" the petitioner claimed.
Supreme Court in its judgement this March affirmed the right to protection from climate change impact as integral to the fundamental right to life (Article 21) and equality (Article 14) enshrined in the Constitution, the plea noted.
Tripathy contended that negligence and inaction by public authorities led to severe deterioration of air quality in Delhi, Odisha and other states, violating citizens' fundamental rights to life and health protected under Article 21.

It indicates that according to the complaint, Supreme Court recently acknowledged the right to a clean environment as crucial to fundamental rights, emphasising how environmental degradation affects health, water, and housing, while disproportionately impacting vulnerable communities.
""Despite govt initiatives, air pollution persists as a substantial concern, with crop burning, insufficient enforcement and industrial emissions. The complainant sought a comprehensive environmental, legal, social and health assessment, coordinated by expert institutions, to evaluate and address the ongoing impact of air pollution on human rights,"" the NHRC noted in its order.

The decision was made with the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) II norms in place, as the air quality level dropped to the ‘very poor’ category on Tuesday.
According to the decision, NDMC parking fees (off-road and indoor parking lots) were doubled from the existing fees for parking managed by NDMC until the revocation of stage-II of the GRAP. Off-road parking lots are those located on the side of main carriageways, such as at Connaught Place. Further, indoor parking refers to those located in the covered area of a complex, such as Palika Bazaar, Shivaji Stadium, and Baba Khadak Singh Parking, said an official.
The enhancement of parking charges will not be implemented for monthly passes and on-street parking lots where the fee is already high due to heavy footfall, such as Pandara and Bengali Market. The increased fee includes raising the fee for four-wheelers from Rs 20 to Rs 40 per hour, Rs 10 to Rs 20 for two-wheelers, and Rs 150 to Rs 300 for buses. In comparison, at indoor parking lots, the fee was increased from Rs 10 to Rs 20 for four-wheelers and Rs 5 to Rs 10 for scooters.

'Hybrid mode'
Following a Supreme Court order and the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) directive, Delhi schools are operating in a hybrid mode (both online and in-person). ]
The CAQM stated, ""State governments in the NCR shall ensure that all classes up to 12th Standard are conducted in a 'hybrid"" mode, i.e., both in ""physical"" and also in ""online"" modes, wherever online mode is feasible in the territorial jurisdiction of the NCT of Delhi and the districts of Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, and Gautam Buddh Nagar in the NCR."" The Delhi Directorate of Education instructed all schools under its jurisdiction to comply.

The Supreme Court, in the case of MC Mehta vs. Union of India, directed CAQM to review its restrictions, noting their impact on education.
The court raised concerns about students missing mid-day meals, lack of online learning resources for some students, and the limited availability of air purifiers in homes, stating, ""A large number of students are being deprived of the facility of mid-day meals as schools and anganwadis are closed.""
""A large number of students do not have the facilities to take advantage of online education. Many educational institutions do not have the facilities to provide online education.

By Suresh Ramasubramanya Iyer, The Energy and Resources Institute in New Delhi
Better airshed management can tackle Delhi’s persistent air pollution.
The air pollution crisis in Delhi stems from a complex interplay of multiple sources. Together they contribute to an annual crisis, with the Indian capital often ranking among the world’s most polluted cities.
For the residents of Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR), the choice is clear: continue down the path of ""death-by-breath"" or strive for a future with a fundamental right to clean air.

Cleaner air over Delhi-NCR is achievable, but the path is fraught with several policy challenges. While measures like the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) and the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) have been introduced to mitigate air pollution, these provide only short-term relief.
Implementing long-term solutions requires substantial financial investments. Political differences can hinder administrative coordination across states. Data gaps, especially in accurately identifying pollution sources, can limit the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. And encouraging behaviour change on a large scale can be a formidable task.

The findings from a 2018 study by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) on Delhi-NCR air quality offer valuable insights into sources of pollution, breaking down their contributions to concentrations of inhalable particulate matter (less than 2.5 micrometre in diameter or PM2.5).
Vehicular emissions are responsible for approximately 24 percent of the city’s particulate matter levels. Industrial activities, particularly from neighbouring states, account for 23 percent of the PM2.5 pollution, fuelled by outdated technologies and lax enforcement of emission standards.
Residential biomass burning in rural areas surrounding Delhi adds another 18 percent, especially during winter when biomass is used for heating and cooking. Dust from construction activities and poorly managed roads contributes 27 percent to particulate matter levels.
These sources are compounded by additional pollution from seasonal crop residue burning in Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, which spikes during October and November.
Frequent temperature inversions during winter trap pollutants close to the surface, turning the city into a pollution hotspot. While pollutants like nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide generally remain within permissible limits, PM2.5 and PM10 levels consistently and severely exceed these limits. Therefore, targeted, long-term solutions to address particulate matter pollution are essential.
A promising approach to tackling Delhi’s persistent air pollution is the concept of airshed management, which views air pollution as a regional challenge.
TERI’s study reveals that Delhi’s emissions contribute, on average, only 36 percent to the city’s inhalable particulate matter concentrations in winter and 26 percent in summer, with the rest originating outside the city.
Activities in neighbouring states — Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan — significantly influence Delhi’s air quality. For instance, the widespread burning of crop residues in Punjab and Haryana during the post-monsoon season is a major factor behind Delhi’s infamous winter smog.
The root causes of crop residue burning are policy incentives to grow rice in this arid region, originally intended for the purpose of food security, but no longer necessary.
Further, a policy diktat by Punjab and Haryana banning rice sowing till the monsoon begins, without a proper hydrological study on the actual impact of pre-monsoon sowing on the groundwater table, leaves no time for farmers to properly harvest and utilise the crop waste. This leaves them with no option but to burn crop waste.
However, farmers are an important political constituency, and these perverse policy incentives must be replaced with others that leave the farmer no worse off.
Effective airshed management requires collaboration across these regions to monitor and control emissions, recognising that pollutants transcend state boundaries.
Building a comprehensive emissions inventory for the entire airshed and conducting source apportionment studies can help identify pollution hotspots and guide targeted interventions.
Equally important is the transition to cleaner energy sources.
Delhi has reduced its reliance on coal by shutting down thermal power plants. However, the city and its surrounding regions must further accelerate their shift toward renewable energy sources such as solar and wind.
Expanding Delhi's fleet of electric buses and providing incentives for electric vehicles can also reduce vehicular emissions. Charging infrastructure must be scaled up to support the growing adoption of EVs, while stringent emission norms for petrol and diesel vehicles should be enforced.
Another critical area is urban planning and infrastructure development. Poorly managed construction activities generate significant amounts of dust, exacerbating air pollution. Adopting best practices such as covering construction sites, using water sprays over dust, and enforcing strict waste disposal regulations can help mitigate this problem.
Urban greenery also plays a vital role in absorbing pollutants and regulating the local climate or “micro-climate”. Expanding green spaces and creating green belts around the city can provide a natural buffer against air pollution.
More technological interventions are also necessary. Advanced air-quality monitoring networks capable of providing real-time data are essential for tracking pollution levels and implementing timely mitigation measures.
Artificial intelligence and machine learning can predict pollution episodes and identify high-risk areas, enabling authorities to take pre-emptive action. Smog towers and large-scale air purifiers, while not a panacea, can serve as supplementary tools in areas with persistently high pollution levels.
Public participation is a cornerstone of any successful long-term strategy. Campaigns encouraging the use of public transport, carpooling, and segregation of wet and dry waste can significantly reduce air pollution.
Community-based initiatives, such as citizen science projects for air-quality monitoring, can foster a sense of responsibility and empower individuals to advocate for cleaner air.
Incentivising industries to adopt cleaner production processes and renewable energy can reduce their environmental footprint without compromising economic growth.
Moreover, creating job opportunities in green sectors such as renewable energy, waste management, and sustainable transport can strike a balance between economic development and environmental sustainability.
Addressing Delhi’s air pollution also requires policy reforms at the national and state levels.
Fiscal measures, such as subsidies for cleaner technologies and penalties for polluting practices, can steer both businesses and individuals toward more sustainable choices. Additionally, better coordination between various government agencies is critical for ensuring that air quality management efforts are not fragmented.
Delhi can also draw inspiration from cities around the world that have successfully tackled air pollution. Beijing implemented strict vehicle emission standards, transitioned to natural gas for heating, and invested heavily in public transport. Los Angeles, once infamous for its smog, adopted stringent air quality regulations and promoted the use of electric vehicles.
Controlling air pollution is not an insurmountable problem.

Gurgaon: After recording the cleanest day of the month, the city's air quality rapidly deteriorated on Monday as winds died down, leaving behind a hazy winter day.
The city's 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) fell shy of ‘very poor' but touched 295 on Monday. It was 207 on Sunday, the cleanest day recorded in Nov so far, because brisk winds washed away pollutants.
Of the four monitoring stations in the city, Gwalpahari recorded the highest average AQI at 315 (very poor) on Monday, followed by Vikas Sadan (287) and Teri Gram (265) – both ‘poor'. The station at Sector 51 did not record any readings. The concentration of PM2.5 – tiny pollutants that can get absorbed into the bloodstream – was the highest at Gwalpahari station, at 343 µg/m³. It was followed by Teri Gram (276 µg/m³) and Vikas Sadan (234 µg/m³).
PM10 levels were 398 µg/m³ at Gwalpahari and 265 µg/m³ at Teri Gram. Vikas Sadan and Sector 51 stations did not record this data.

These figures far exceed the safe limits set in India -- at 60 µg/m³ for PM2.5 and 100 µg/m³ for PM10.
According to the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), unpaved and damaged roads, traffic jams, illegal waste dumping and open waste burning are key reasons for high pollution at these locations.
""Along with enforcement of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), the state pollution board had directed civic bodies to follow the winter action plan to curb air pollution. It includes sprinkling of water, mechanical sweeping of roads, and work to repair roads and drains,"" an HSPCB official said on Monday.

According to the Met department's forecast, temperatures are likely to hover in the same range, and moderate to dense fog will persist in the region.
""Dense to very dense fog is likely to occur in isolated areas of south Haryana due to high moisture ratio and inability of low-speed winds to disperse it. Dense fog will be predominantly present in the late night and early morning hours of the day,"" an advisory by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. Central govt's forecasting agency SAFAR also said average wind speed in Delhi-NCR will be less than 10kmph, allowing pollutants to remain suspended in the air.
""The ventilation index lower than 6000 m2/s with average wind speed less than 10 kmph is unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants. The air quality is likely to be in the severe to very poor category,"" SAFAR said.
Morning did not show the day to Delhi, on air quality at least.
Monday began with poor air quality — 285 at 9am — and by night the AQI in the city had progressively turned very poor — 369 by 6pm. By 8pm, several stations had severe readings.
The average air quality index (AQI) of the city was 349 on Monday, compared to 318 a day earlier."

The apex court asked air management panel on Monday to take a call on relaxing the order on mandatory online classes under GRAP stages III and IV, noting that many students would miss out on the benefit of mid-day meals, many of them didn't have facilities to take online classes and many educational institutions too didn't have facilities to provide online education. The court also noted that the ""residences of many students do not have air purifiers, and therefore, there may not be any difference between the children sitting at home and the children attending school"".

Meanwhile the schools in the city geared up for the new challenge. Sunita, principal, Ravi Shankar SKV in Bawana, said, ""We won't probably opt for hybrid, but if it happens, we will need to reorganise our timetable and teachers' work because we will require teachers to be available for both modes simultaneously. We will have to combine sections for lessons on similar subjects, especially in online mode. Offline mode will depend on classroom strength.""
Rooma Pathak, principal, MM Public School, Pitampura, stated, ""It's difficult to function like this. We tried the hybrid mode once but it proved ineffective for the students. A camera recorded the teacher taking classes as usual. Students at home could watch this footage.""
On November 14, chief minister Atishi had announced that all primary classes were to shift to the online mode in the wake of the city's air quality reaching ‘severe' levels. Three days later on Nov 17, CAQM ordered the implementation of GRAP Stage IV, which, in respect of school education, gives govt the option to shift more classes to online mode.
And then as the air quality kept on worsening, the Supreme Court stepped in and on Nov 18 — the most polluted day of the current winter season — directed all the classes to be held online. The court had also kept the GRAP Stage IV restrictions intact until further orders. On Monday, with AQI having moved out of the ‘severe' zone in the past few days, it said CAQM could consider the order on compulsory online classes in schools."

AQI of the city was 349 on Monday, compared with 318 a day earlier.
The city continues to have GRAP-IV restrictions in place.
Moderate consistent winds over the past 24 hours had helped in lightening the burden of pollutants in the city's air on Sunday, taking the AQI out of the ‘severe' category.
On Monday, the air quality early warning system expects the AQI to deteriorate again to ‘severe' levels within a week. The city saw a clear sky during most of the morning hours, but a thin shroud of smog was visible by late afternoon.

On Sunday, the hourly PM2.5 level saw drastic improvement, and by 4pm, it had reached 69 micrograms per cubic metre, close the national permissible 24-hourly reading of 60 micrograms per cubic metre. However, Monday noon, the PM2.5 level spiked to 294 micrograms per cubic metre, almost five times the safe standards.
According to the weather department, the city saw winds during the morning hours. However, the winds slowed down to 6 kmph by evening. The IMD also expects the city to see dense to moderate fog soon. A yellow alert has been issued for Nov 28 and 29 for the fog.
Meanwhile, the air quality early warning system by IITM also expects the AQI to turn ‘severe' over the next three to four days. ""The air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor' category from Nov 26-27. The air quality is likely to be in the ‘severe' category on Nov 28,"" the air quality early warning system stated. Regarding the outlook on the next six days, the system has warned of ‘severe' to ‘very poor' category air quality.
For Tuesday, there is a forecast for smog or shallow to moderate fog in the morning with winds at 8 kmph, which will increase further to less than 12 kmph by the afternoon, but decrease by evening, causing the formation of smog again.
According to the decision support system (DSS), on Monday, stubble burning contributed 11.1% (against 19.5% on Sunday) to the city's net pollution. On Monday, local transport caused 16.5% of the city's pollution, while Jhajjar contributed 6.5%, Delhi's residential emissions were 4%, and peripheral industries contributed 3%."

The kidney is particularly vulnerable to toxic effects from environmental pollutants owing to its filtration functions; environmental and occupational exposures to pollutants remain common causes of kidney disease worldwide, especially in developing countries. Up to 22% of the global burden of disease and 23% of deaths are attributable to environmental pollution; the general public is inevitably exposed to environmental pollutants.
There is no good community data from India. However studies from other parts of the world have shown that long-term exposure to particulate matter <2.5 μm in mean aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) is associated with increased risk of membranous nephropathy and more rapid decline in renal function. Membranous Nephroptahy is a kidney disease which happens because of damage to kidney filters resulting in massive leakage of protein in the urine. It is believed that thus damage is due to the particulate matter. In a research study published recently in th the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology air pollution has been implicated in the increasing risk of new cases of kidney disease, and quicker progression of CKD to dialysis .This study evaluated 2.5 million veterans who did not have kidney disease when they were screened in 2003 and 2004. Their cases were “followed” across the country for an average of 8.5 years and compared to air pollution levels across the country being monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). For accuracy, researchers also took into account recent improvement in air quality in the U.S., and patients’ kidney disease risk factors (age, race, sex, heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, and poverty).
The study found that for every increase in pollution of 10 micrograms per cubic meter of air, there was a 25 to 37% increase in the number of veterans with new kidney disease, a 36% increase in rapid loss of kidney function, and a 31% increase in risk of kidney failure followed by dialysis. The study also estimated that pollution, could have caused about 45,000 new cases of CKD and 2438 patients starting dialysis during the time of the study. Similarly studies in Taiwanese and Korean adults have also observed associations between higher PM air pollution levels and reduced renal function, an increased risk of developing CKD, In a study done in Europe short-term exposure to elevated air pollution levels was associated with a decrease in eGFR. The main pollutants affecting the kidneys were PMs and SO2. In medium-term an increase in annual concentration of PM2.5 and NO2 resulted in an increased number of patients with chronic kidney disease.

The toxicity of air pollution has become a concern among neighbors as well. Bhutan will have to endure less pollution if pollution level is low in India, Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay said on Monday asserting that India becoming an advanced nation will ensure cleaner air for his country as well.

Delhi's air quality dropped to the 'very poor' category on Tuesday, with an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 385 recorded around 8:00 am, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). A thick layer of fog was seen in areas like Anand Vihar, Kalkaji, Nehru Place, and Akshardham Temple as the city's air quality continued to deteriorate. According to the Central Pollution Control Board, an AQI in the 'Severe' category can affect healthy individuals and seriously impact those with pre-existing health conditions, while 'Poor' and 'Very Poor' levels can cause respiratory discomfort and illnesses with prolonged exposure.


Delhiites are struggling with respiratory illnesses earlier this year
""This time Delhi is witnessing respiratory illnesses earlier than used to be recorded in November. We are seeing the pollution rising earlier than November this year. Due to this, there is a 10-15 per cent rise in the number of patients suffering from respiratory diseases,"" Dr Rajesh Chawla, a senior consultant on Respiratory Diseases at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital told news agency ANI.

Yes

""Air pollution is like slow poison. It affects children in developing age and elders. Action should be taken at a personal, government, and national level. If you want to prevent the effects of air pollution, then using an N95 face mask is essential,"" he said.
Special OPD services for air pollution patients open
With symptoms like watery eyes and cough increasingly seen among patients, city based hospital Ram Manohar Lohia has started running special OPD services for pollution patients. ""Right now we are seeing patients of respiratory, eyes, and skin complaints, major in our OPDs. We have seen the increased number of patients in our chest OPD now, with the vision of our medical superintendent, Dr Ajay Shukla, we have started this pollution-related illness clinic every Monday from 2 to 4 pm,"" Dr Ajit Jindal from the respiratory department told the media. ""Today, we saw patients coming with the cough, sneezing, cold, itching in the throat, watering eyes, and some of the patients with burning in the skin. These are the main symptoms which patients are coming with,"" he explained.
How serious is Delhi's air pollution?
""The air pollution in Delhi is a serious health hazard, particularly in the winter when vehicle emissions, industrial pollutants, and stubble burning all contribute to high smog levels. A lower life expectancy, heart disease, and respiratory problems are among the major concerns associated with the city's sometimes ""hazardous"" air quality. Children, the elderly, and people with pre-existing medical issues are particularly vulnerable to long-term exposure,"" said Dr. Kuldeep Kumar Grover, Head of Critical Care & Pulmonology, CK Birla Hospital Gurugram.

""Air pollution is bad for your physical and emotional wellbeing. In terms of health, it causes immune system weakness, heart issues, and respiratory disorders. Long-term exposure is associated with mental health issues such anxiety, depression, and cognitive decline. Nitrogen dioxide and PM2.5 are two examples of pollutants that can exacerbate stress, set off mood problems, and even alter brain function, raising the risk of neurodegenerative illnesses,"" he adds.
Air pollution poses significant health risks, affecting millions of people globally. The inhalation of pollutants like particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), and ozone can cause both short-term and long-term health issues.

In the short term, air pollution can trigger respiratory problems such as asthma, bronchitis, and chronic cough. Individuals with pre-existing conditions, like asthma or cardiovascular diseases, are particularly vulnerable to worsening symptoms when exposed to polluted air. Even healthy people may experience irritation in the eyes, nose, and throat, along with difficulty breathing during high pollution episodes.

Long-term exposure to polluted air has more severe consequences. It can lead to chronic respiratory diseases, lung cancer, and heart disease. Studies have also linked prolonged exposure to reduced lung function and premature death, especially in children, the elderly, and people with compromised immune systems. Additionally, air pollution has been associated with increased risks of stroke, cognitive decline, and pregnancy complications, including low birth weight.
Are we doing enough to stay safe from the pollution?
As per Dr. Pratibha Dogra, Senior Consultant- Pulmonology and Sleep Medicine, Marengo Asia Hospital Gurugram, ""even though people are aware of the risks posed by air pollution, not enough is being done to stay safe. Long-term fixes like cutting emissions, encouraging renewable energy, and tightening laws are falling behind, even though some people use masks and air purifiers. Additionally, there are not enough people using public transportation, planting trees, and driving less to have a long-lasting effect.""
Khaasi aur Qawwali: When Delhi's pollution inspires musical talents

The doctor stressed the effect of pollution on kids and senior citizens. ""- Children are especially vulnerable to the negative effects of air pollution because they have weaker lungs, respiratory infections, and worsening cardiac issues. Limiting outdoor activities during periods of high pollution, using air purifiers indoors, making sure kids wear masks outdoors, and promoting a nutrient-rich diet to strengthen immunity are all ways to keep them safe,"" Dr. Dogra explains.
Pollution hotspots in Delhi
13 hotspots have been identified in Delhi as pollution hotspots: Narela, Bawana, Mundka, Wazirpur, Rohini, R.K. Puram, Okhla, Jahangirpuri, Anand Vihar, Punjabi Bagh, Mayapuri, Dwarka. As per the Department of Environment, the hotspots have been identified depending upon the annual average of PM10 exceeding μg/m3 and for PM2.5 more than 100 μg/m3. This is based on data of the nearby located (in radius of 2km) continuous air quality monitoring stations established by DPCC.
Breathing polluted air is a serious health hazard- Stop believing these myths

To control air pollution, the Department of Environment is planning to implement several points like identification of plastic & garbage dump and its removal, identification and repair of road patches and potholes, de-congestion of congested traffic points, mechanical road sweeping, water sprinkling of roads and night patrolling to check violations with respect to bio-mass burning, C&D waste dumping etc.
How is smog dangerous to human health?

To protect yourself during periods of high air pollution, stay indoors as much as possible, especially during peak pollution hours. Keep windows and doors closed to reduce indoor exposure, and use air purifiers if available. If you need to go outside, wear a mask, such as an N95, to filter out harmful particles. Avoid outdoor exercise or strenuous activities that increase breathing rate. Drink plenty of water to help flush out toxins, and consider using a saline nasal spray to clear airways. Stay informed by monitoring air quality levels and taking precautions accordingly.

In a recent social media post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Kamath argued that Delhi's air pollution crisis shouldn't be seen as an isolated issue but as a national problem with far-reaching consequences.
The proposed link between air quality and property prices is meant to incentivise a collective effort towards cleaner air. By tying economic value to environmental health, Kamath suggests homeowners and communities will have a stronger reason to advocate for cleaner air policies and take action to reduce pollution.
Kamath bolstered his argument by sharing data highlighting the devastating impact of air pollution on public health. He pointed out that the economic burden of pollution is enormous, with the potential to offset any potential gains from inflated property prices.

Maybe a property price discount for the quality of air and water is the solution. If economics accounted for this, maybe we would all figure this out. Essentially the air and water quality determines the rate for the property.
Also, this would probably turn a property owner into the owner of the place, and better odds of fixing it if working as a group. For example, if I went from owning a property in JP Nagar and caring for it to caring for my layout in JP Nagar and then the whole of JP Nagar, it could have a better outcome.

Meanwhile in Delhi, the air quality index receded to the poor range on Sunday, aided by consistent winds and less moisture, after a Saturday with a 'severe' AQI score.
The air quality index (AQI) was 348 at 11am, fell to 323 by 3pm and was 308 by 6pm. By 9pm, it was 297.
The average AQI of the capital was 412 on Saturday.
Sunday's reading, though poor, is the best Delhi has managed to get on the AQI scale in November.
On Sunday, the capital saw relatively clear skies and better wind conditions compared with the previous fortnight. Delhi got winds reaching up to 15 kmph. ""The region received westerly winds, which are dry. The speed hovered between 10-15 kmph, starting late Saturday night, thus cleaning up the air quality. The wind speed is likely to be good for the next 2-3 days, with no possibility of fog, which means that the air quality may improve further,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of climate change and meteorology at Skymet.

According to the air quality early warning system by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Monday may see predominant surface wind less than 8 kmph during morning hours, along with smog or shallow to moderate fog. The wind speed will increase thereafter, becoming close to 12 kmph from the northwest direction during the afternoon. It will decrease thereafter, becoming less than 8 kmph from the northwest direction during the evening and night, along with smog or shallow fog towards evening or night. The IITM expects the AQI to remain very poor.
""The air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor' category from Nov 25-27. The outlook for the subsequent 6 days: The air quality is likely to be in the very poor to severe category,"" IITM's air quality early warning system said."

BAKU: The air pollution crisis in Delhi was discussed here on the sidelines of UN climate talks COP29 on Monday, with experts from the global health community urging India to chart a future that is not dependent on fossil fuels. They also called for reforms to ensure climate policies prioritise people, not polluters, by transitioning towards renewable energy and strengthening public transport infrastructure in cities.
In the context of vehicular pollution and emissions from coal-based power plants that pollute cities round-the-year, they underlined that there is broad consensus among health communities on the need to phase out fossil fuels sooner than later, redirect health-harming subsidies from the sector, and apply some of the lessons learnt from tobacco control to check fossil fuels use. They discussed the severe health impacts of fossil fuel pollution and emphasised the need for urgent policy changes.
Speaking about how fossil fuel use is escalating the air pollution crisis in many parts of the globe, Enkhun Byambadorj, co-founder, Breathe Mongolia, said, ""The narrative in support of fossil fuels focusses on strong economic development and growth as the only parameter of success. We need to reframe this narrative and discourse. The air we breathe is a choice we make as a society at the expense of our young children and the future of everyone.""
Aarti Khosla, director, Climate Trends, said, ""We are all gathered here to talk about bigger issues that affect our climate and countries are dragging their feet so much when the lives and health of millions are at risk. We need to be urgently responsive to the realities of climate change that the world is facing today.""

The air pollution rates right now are extremely high which is a matter of concern. It is crucial to understand the impact of such low air quality on the lungs of the elderly to better the health of these older residents.
Human lungs, as we age, naturally tend to lose the elasticity they have during the younger ages, the air sacs and the airways stiffen up and the immunity drops thus making the elderly more prone to catching respiratory infections.
These natural changes in the human body make the elderly more prone to being a victim of the adverse effects of air pollution. The PM which is the particulate matter is way more than a healthy rate according to World Health Organization’s safety guidelines in Delhi, which makes Delhi a particularly dangerous zone. Such open exposure to pollutants such as PM2. 5 and nitrogen dioxide pushes the decline in the lung function and also ultimately makes a person more prone to having COPD which is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Through recent studies it was observed that the elder population in Delhi is more prone to facing respiratory complications due to extreme pollution. In a study done in 2020 it was reported that over 30% of Delhi's elder population face some form of chronic respiratory issues most of these cases are directly tied to being exposed to polluted air for too long.
Practical tips to combat air pollution in Delhi
Stay Hydrated: One of the simplest yet most effective ways to combat the effects of air pollution is to maintain adequate hydration. Hydration helps improve liquification, secretions in the nose, oral cavity, and respiratory passages. It makes it easier for the body to clear out pollutants and reduces their harmful impact.

Nasal Barrier Protection: An unconventional yet effective method to protect against pollutants is the application of a small amount of edible oil inside the nostrils. Any household edible oil can serve this purpose. This creates a barrier that traps pollutants, which are then swallowed and processed by the digestive system rather than entering the lungs. This method can significantly reduce the amount of harmful particles entering the respiratory tract.
Increase Indoor Humidity: Enhancing the humidity levels in your living environment can also help reduce the presence of airborne particulate matter. Devices like tabletop fountains or humidifiers add moisture to the air, causing dust and pollutants to settle rather than remain suspended. Increased humidity can improve air quality indoors and help alleviate the dryness associated with polluted air, providing comfort to the respiratory system.
Include Indoor Plants: Incorporating indoor plants into your home can serve as a natural air purifier. Plants such as spider plants, peace lilies, and snake plants not only enhance the aesthetic of a space but also have the ability to absorb pollutants like formaldehyde and benzene. By introducing these plants into your living areas, you can naturally improve air quality and create a healthier living environment.
Indoor Air Purifiers: Utilizing indoor air purifiers can be an effective way to combat indoor pollution. Air purifiers equipped with HEPA filters are especially effective in capturing a wide range of particulate matter, including pollen, pet dander, dust mites, and tobacco smoke. For those living in highly polluted areas like Delhi, air purifiers can provide an additional layer of protection, ensuring cleaner indoor air and reducing the risk of pollution-related respiratory issues.

The analysis was conducted at two of Pune's busiest intersections — University Circle and Shivajinagar. It mapped out a ‘pollution pathway' through the respiratory system, revealing how different-sized particles affect various parts of our respiratory system.
""These particles make their way through three main regions of our respiratory system — the upper airways (extrathoracic region), the middle airways (tracheobronchial region) and the deep lung tissue (alveolar region). We found that the largest particles, known as PM10, mainly get stuck in our upper airways, with about 85% of them being caught in the nose and throat area. The medium-sized particles (PM4 and PM2.5) manage to travel deeper, with PM4 showing a particular preference for the tracheobronchial region — the airways leading to our lungs. These particles deposit heavily in this part, with PM2.5 particles showing the highest deposition rates of 39% in this region, followed closely by 33% in the deepest parts of the lungs,"" said PG Satsangi, professor and study researcher from SPPU.
Akshay Kale, one of the authors of the study, said the analysis does not directly test pollution effects on human subjects. Instead, researchers used a well-established scientific model called International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) to calculate how pollution particles would affect different parts of the respiratory system. This model is based on decades of previous research and experimental data about how particles move through human airways.

The analysis found that pollution levels spike by 50%-62% during morning hours compared to evening. It means, people's morning walk or commute might be exposing them to more harmful particles than evening activities. The analysis also recorded pollution levels ranging from as low as 0.02 microgram per minute to as high as 2.24 microgram per minute for the largest particles (PM10) at the two junctions, with varying levels for smaller particles.

This underscores a dual crisis: an environmental emergency and a public health catastrophe, costing India over a million lives and 1.6%-1.8% of its GDP annually. Globally, 9 in 10 people breathe air that fails to meet WHO standards.
For India, the critical challenge is advancing development while mitigating the impacts of air pollution. The solution lies in science-based actions, inspired by global successes and tailored to India’s unique needs.
You can’t fix what you can’t measure

Identifying pollution sources is essential for effective solutions. Research from the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) pinpoints key culprits: vehicular emissions, industrial pollution, crop burning, and construction dust. Countries like the UAE and the US use emission inventories to track pollutants; Beijing’s Clean Air Action Plan cut PM2.5 levels by 35% in just five years. India’s National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) aims for a 40% reduction in PM 2.5 and 10 levels by 2026. We need stronger data (pollutants and emissions at source), clear regulations, ambitious targets and accountability to drive real change.

Air pollution is a ‘glocal’ problem—global in reach but local in solutions. So, what are the strategies we can adopt?
1. Greening Urban Mobility: India’s transportation sector accounts for 2.9 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Lessons from Norway, where 54% of new cars are electric, and Copenhagen, with 62% cycling daily, show the way. India’s EV sales surged 42% in FY24, but more must be done — expand the FAME scheme, incentivise EV adoption, and ramp up public transport and cycling infrastructure.

2. Cleaner Industry and Energy: Industrial pollution contributes 30-35% of India’s CO2 emissions, with coal power plants responsible for 60% of this. China’s ‘War on Pollution’ reduced urban emissions by 40% by shifting to renewables and enforcing stricter pollution controls. India must phase out coal, retrofit factories, and empower regulators to enforce standards.
3. Agriculture and Stubble Burning: Stubble burning releases harmful pollutants like CO2, CO, and particulate matter. In India, it contributes to 149 million tons of CO2 annually. In Argentina, Brazil, and Bolivia, large agribusinesses have shifted to no-burn methods and residue management techniques like mulching and the use of biochar. This success was driven by a combination of stringent environmental regulations and farmer subsidies. India must incentivise farmers to adopt clean technologies (developed by ICAR and others), expanding crop residue management schemes.
4. Citizen Power: Clean air requires collective action. India’s SAFAR platform offers real-time air quality updates, empowering citizens. South Korea has taken this further with ‘citizen inspectors’ and drones to monitor pollution. India must innovate, creating participatory platforms where citizens become changemakers in the fight for cleaner air.
5. Sustainable Financing: Global funding for air pollution is limited, with less than 1% of international climate finance allocated to it between 2015 and 2021. However, the Indian govt allocated Rs 948 crore to pollution control in the 2023-24 Union Budget, a 64% increase from the previous year. We need to ensure these funds are used effectively, leveraging innovative financing models like green bonds to support public transport, urban greening, and renewable energy projects. The World Bank has committed $1.5B for the Indo-Gangetic plain states and the UP cabinet has just approved setting up of a Clean Air Management Authority which aims to reduce PM 2.5 to < 45 ug/cu.m in five years.
6. Clean Energy for Cooking, Heating: Over 76% of Indian households have access to LPG, but many still rely on traditional cooking methods. The Ujjwala scheme has connected over 8 crore households to cleaner cooking fuels, but we must continue expanding access, learning from programs like Mexico’s solar cooking and Kenya’s clean cookstoves.
7. Forests as Our Saviours: Between 2001 and 2022, India lost 2.1 million hectares of forest, releasing 1.56 gigatons of CO2. But forests can be powerful allies in the fight against pollution. China’s ‘Great Green Wall’ and Costa Rica’s reforestation programs offer valuable lessons. India’s efforts, such as its Green India Mission and CAMPA (Compensatory Afforestation), could adopt these strategies, combining community-driven efforts with technology to track forest health and carbon sequestration.
Air pollution costs the world 1.2 billion workdays and $8.1 trillion in health damages annually—6.1% of global GDP. It’s time to treat clean air not just as an environmental or health issue but as an economic asset. With countries in the Indo-Gangetic plain working towards an AQI target of 35 by 2035, India can lead the way. The time is now for parliamentarians, policymakers, civil society, academia, and the private sector to unite in this mission.

Jaipur: Inhaling polluted air has become an inevitable challenge, with escalating health concerns becoming more concerning daily. The situation appears dire and stifling when observed in the NCR region, while Jaipur also experiences unfavourable conditions.
The polluted air is not only worsening conditions for those with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but is now being associated with increasing lung cancer cases where smoking is not a factor.
""Lung cancer to a large extent a preventable disease and 50-60% of patients are because of smoking. But, there are lots of emerging studies in which we can see lung cancer in non-smokers and non-passive smokers too. Many experts now believe that it is because of air pollution,"" said Dr Hemant Malhotra, director, oncology services at Mahatma Gandhi Hospital.
Malhotra said, ""The carcinogenic effects of air pollution on the lungs are mediated through multiple mechanisms, including oxidative stress, inflammation, genotoxicity and immune dysregulation. PM 2.5 and other airborne pollutants can penetrate deep into the respiratory tract, which induces oxidative stress and inflammation, leading to DNA damage and activation of oncology pathways. Furthermore, certain air pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and benzene, possess direct genotoxic properties, promoting the initiation and progression of lung cancer.""

Research studies consistently show a correlation between extended exposure to air pollution and heightened lung cancer risk. ""Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter has been particularly implicated, with a meta-analysis reporting a significant association between PM 2.5 particulate matter exposure and lung cancer incidence. Additionally, nitrogen dioxide, a common component of traffic-related air pollution, has been linked to elevated lung cancer risk, especially in urban areas with high vehicular traffic density,"" said Dr Malhotra.
Air pollution consists of various elements, including particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, ozone, volatile organic compounds, and heavy metals from human activities and natural origins. ""Mitigating the impact of air pollution on lung cancer requires concerted efforts at the individual, community, and policy levels. Individuals can reduce their exposure to air pollution by avoiding outdoor activities during peak pollution hours, using air purifiers indoors, and adopting sustainable transportation options,"" he said.
The new cases of lung cancer emerging every year have become a cause of concern for the health authorities and doctors. ""Air pollution is a cause of poor health, lung diseases including COPD and lung cancer. This is more so a problem for the northern parts of India, especially Delhi, Rajasthan, and Haryana. With the quality of air getting worse, the health impact is even more severe. Every year 65,000-70,000 new cases of lung cancer are registered in India due to air pollution,"" said Dr Sheetu Singh, Director, Lung Center, at a private hospital.
The health department has also started looking at air pollution as an emerging challenge for them. A senior health department official said, ""We are spreading awareness on tobacco control and encouraging people to quit smoking to reduce the burden of lung cancer, but air pollution is now becoming a challenge for us as a lot of oncologists and doctors are now suspecting a link between air pollution and lung cancer."""

Particulate matter, along with NO₂ and SO₂ due to Diwali, always increases, observed during the late night hours, peaking between 7 PM - 1 AM. Its the time when fireworks are used almost everywhere. This emits high levels of pollutants in the air that cause severe disruption to our respiratory system. While many of us experience short-term effects like coughing, wheezing, and irritation, the long-term health risks are often not taken seriously.
Immediate vs. Long-Term Health Effects
The harsh reality of air pollution brings symptoms that range from mild irritation to severe respiratory distress in the immediate period of Diwali. People with conditions like asthma, bronchitis, or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD) become sensitive to increased symptoms around Diwali. The extreme levels of pollution is highly harmful to the health of children, the elderly, and individuals with compromised immune system.
Yet, the reality is that even healthy people are at good risk of long-term diseases. Particles in polluted air are easy enough to pass through the lungs and even into the bloodstream, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. Over time, exposure to such particles can gradually contribute to the development of chronic conditions such as:

Chronic Respiratory Diseases: Chronic exposure to polluted air may lead to long-term diseases such as asthma and COPD even in previously healthy individuals. High-pollution events, like Diwali, are particularly risky.
Cardiovascular Problems: Airborne particles can do more harm than one thinks to the lungs. Studies have consistently demonstrated that air pollution is linked with the hardening of the arteries, raising the risks of heart attacks, strokes, and other
cardiovascular problems.
Lung Cancer: Similarly, polluted air has long been associated with increasing the risk of lung cancer. If smoking is on top in this regard, carcinogenic elements breathed in through polluted air are equally deadly, especially over the years.
Prevention: What Can be Done?
While it's nearly impossible to completely avoid air pollution during and after Diwali, there are several steps you can take to reduce your exposure and protect your health:
Limit Outdoor Exposure:
Avoid spending a long time outdoors, especially when it's the peak hours of firecracker activity. If you have to go out, it is advised to use a N95 mask to filter out harmful particles.
Use Air Purifiers:
Investing in a good air purifier can make a big difference, especially with young children or elderly members at home. Keep windows and doors closed to prevent polluted air from entering your home.
Hydration and Nutrition:
Staying hydrated helps your body flush out toxins, while a diet rich in antioxidants can boost your immune system to combat the effects of pollution. Include fruits, vegetables, and omega-3-rich foods to support lung health.
Practice Breathing Exercises:
Simple breathing exercises like Anulom Vilom helps strengthen the lungs and improve respiratory function. This seems to even benefit individuals with asthma or other chronic respiratory conditions.
Monitor Air Quality:
Pay attention to air quality index (AQI) updates during the festive season. If the AQI is high, it’s best to stay indoors as much as possible.
The Road Ahead
While individual contributions go a long way in decrease the impacts of pollution, saving people from its chronic health effects requires systemic changes on a larger scale. This calls for a reduction in the use of firecrackers and making the celebration of Diwali an eco-friendly affair. Such initiatives by the government aimed at cutting down pollution, especially during the festive seasons, are very vital in safeguarding public health in the future.
This is a time for joy, but not at the expense of our health. Equally important is the need to keep alive the awareness of the dangers lurking beneath air pollution. By being aware of the risks and taking proactive measures to reduce long-term effects on health, we ensure a safer, healthier future for all.

As a haze of pollution blanketed the region, schools across NCR have been closed and classes turned to online mode for many. Offices have also turned to implementing work from home so employees can avoid stepping out under these circumstances.

According to the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), air quality is likely to remain in the 'very poor' category for the next six days.
Meanwhile in Delhi, the air quality relapsed to 'severe' by Friday evening after staying in the 'very poor' range till afternoon. AQI was 373 at 10am. In the absence of strong winds, it saw deteriorated to 401 by 6pm.
On Friday, the capital got variable winds from westerly, north-westerly and easterly directions, with speeds ranging from 2-6 kmph, accompanied by shallow fog and smog in the morning. These conditions, coupled with low temperatures - 11 degrees Celsius at the minimum and 27.2 maximum - led to accumulation of pollutants through the day.
While the city continues to be under GRAP-IV restrictions and the fog layer has moved out, the share of most of the pollution sources re mained almost the same.

The alteration comes at a time when there is an increasing prevalence of respiratory disorders associated with pollution and various pulmonary conditions in many parts of the country, especially in the national capital and neighbouring areas.
Medical experts have criticised National Medical Commission's justification for reducing the academic load on MBBS students, noting it as an unreasonable stance, given the growing need for primary physicians to address the surge in respiratory conditions.
Dr GC Khilnani, director of respiratory medicine at PSRI Hospital and ICS (north zone) chair, highlighted India's position among the world's most polluted nations. He pointed out that PM2.5 exposure exceeds WHO safety guidelines for over 99% of Indians, requiring urgent action to reduce pollution and strengthen medical facilities.

The health consequences are significant, with respiratory and cardiovascular conditions worsening when the air quality index turns hazardous, particularly affecting vulnerable groups. The Poseidon study, published in The Lancet in 2015, showed respiratory symptoms constitute over half of all medical consultations in India.
Dr Khilnani stressed the need for systematic improvements, particularly in developing comprehensive respiratory healthcare infrastructure, to address pollution-related medical challenges.

As the chairman of respiratory medicine, critical care and sleep medicine at Saroj Superspeciality Hospital and Jaipur Golden Hospital, and vice-president of ICS, Dr Rakesh Chawla emphasised how respiratory medicine departments are essential for diagnosing and treating complex breathing disorders while backing broader health initiatives.
He cautioned that removing these specialised departments would severely impact patient care, particularly in managing tuberculosis (TB), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pollution-related illnesses. Such actions would impede India's efforts to eradicate TB, he added.
Dr Chawla further noted that hospitals lacking dedicated respiratory units faced substantial constraints in providing thorough healthcare services and meeting the broader medical needs of the community.
WHO's Global TB Report 2024 highlights India's significant tuberculosis burden, revealing that the country represents 26% of the worldwide active TB cases. In 2023, India recorded the highest worldwide share of multidrug-resistant TB cases at 27% while also accounting for 26% of TB-related fatalities globally.
Dr Manoj Goel, principal director and head of the department of pulmonary medicine at Fortis Medical Research Institute, Gurgaon, also stressed the crucial requirement for accessible, high-quality respiratory healthcare services in the present circumstances."

While the city continues to be under GRAP-IV restrictions and the fog layer has moved out, the share of most of the pollution sources remained almost the same. On Thursday, stubble burning contributed 17.9% to the net pollution, while local transport caused 18.2%, turning out to be the highest polluter.
According to the air quality early warning system by IITM, Saturday may see predominant surface wind from the west direction with speeds less than 4 kmph during morning hours, thus allowing the formation of smog or shallow fog in the morning, evening and night. The wind speed will further increase to 6 kmph from the northwest direction during the afternoon and again decrease to less than 4 kmph from the northwest direction during the evening and night.

The IITM expects AQI to remain very poor. ""The ventilation index lower than 6,000 m2/s with average wind speed less than 10 kmph is unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants. The air quality is likely to be in the very poor category from Nov 23-25,"" IITM said. In the subsequent 6 days, too, the AQI is likely to be very poor.
The PM2.5 level in the city on Thursday until 7pm oscillated between 160.9 and 196.8 micrograms per cubic metre, against a 24-hour national standard of 60 micrograms per cubic metre, and 15 units according to WHO standards.
The PM10 levels hovered between 281.7 and 327.2 micrograms per cubic metre, against a national standard of 100 units and 45 units as per WHO standards.
Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai has written to the Delhi chief secretary asking him to personally ensure that GRAP measures are adhered to properly.
""All the departments must submit daily reports on their actions and progress in implementing GRAP guidelines. This data will be critical for monitoring the effectiveness of measures and identifying areas requiring additional focus. The enforcement mechanisms being followed by various departments must be further intensified. Strict penalties should be imposed on violators of pollution control norms, including unauthorised construction and demolition activities, open burning of waste, burning of Parali, and other activities contributing to air pollution,"" Rai wrote.
Gurgaon's air quality, meanwhile, slipped into 'very poor' zone after staying in the 'poor' category for a day.
Experts attributed the deterioration to low wind speed, which did not allow the dispersal of pollutants.
Gwalpahari station recorded an AQI of 354, marking it as the most polluted area. This station covers the Gurgaon-Faridabad road, Golf Course road, and several highrises.

Like every year, this year also, Delhi's air pollution is being linked to the burning of stubble, popularly known as ‘Parali’ in Hindi. This is believed to be a traditional practice, most common among the farmers in Punjab, Haryana, and parts of Delhi, greatly impacting the environment and the health of humans and animals.
What is stubble or parali?

Stubble, in simple terms, is the remaining portion of rice plants after harvesting.

Farmers cut the rice while leaving the roots and stalks behind. Modern harvesting practices commonly leave longer and massive amounts of stubble, which is of no use to farmers. As an immediate and easy way to clear their fields to start growing the next crop, many farmers choose to burn their dry leftovers, leading to air pollution.

Legal actions and government response
The National Green Tribunal (NGT) of India banned the harmful practice of burning stubble in 2018, to safeguard the environment. The law presents fines for farmers who burn stubble- - Rs. 2,500 for small lands and Rs. 5,000 for larger farms. The tribunal also advocates for the government to offer rewards for farmers who think of and practice other ways to manage crop waste, comparatively safer for the environment, such as composting machines.
Significant health impacts of stubble burning

The practice of burning stubble emits severely harmful and toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, which facilitate air pollution. This can cause serious health problems, including skin irritation, respiratory issues, and even more severe diseases such as cancer and asthma.
Economic consequences for farmers
Burning stubble is indeed a quick and simple method of clearing fields, but it’s not all positive. Other than the health concerns and environmental damage, this practice can also potentially pose a threat to farmers financially. The burning destroys essential nutrients in the soil gradually. Poor quality of soil can lead to lower field productivity, putting farmers in a difficult position.
Safer alternatives to stubble burning

There are a few safer ways to handle this significant problem. Some machines can help assimilate stubble back into the soil, but the concern here is that they can be greatly expensive for many farmers. Increased and consistent support from the government, such as affordable machinery and equipment, or financial aid is crucial. Moreover, creating biofuel plants that convert crop waste into energy can offer farmers an alternative way of income, while also eliminating the need to burn stubble."

Why detoxing our lungs is important

Your lungs play an important role in keeping us healthy by supplying oxygen to our body. Exposure to air pollution, smoking, and certain illnesses can overload them with toxins and irritants. This can lead to:
Increased mucus or phlegm buildup.
Constant coughing.
Difficulty breathing and decreased lung capacity.

Detoxing the lungs helps them clear out accumulated toxins and improve overall respiratory health.

Jaipur: Concerned over air pollution levels reaching alarming levels in the state, police headquarters on Thursday reissued strict orders to all station house officers (SHOs) to ensure that crop residues are not in areas burnt within their jurisdictions.
The directive warns that SHOs will be held personally responsible for any such incident and face departmental action if violations occur. The orders come as a continuation of earlier instructions issued by the home department on Nov 8. These instructions authorise SHOs across the state to prevent crop residue burning, which is a major contributor to air pollution.
The state govt has also asked district collectors to form committees at the sub-divisional level under the chairpersonship of sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs). These committees will comprise nayab tehsildars, block development officers, tehsildars, and assistant agriculture officers. The committees' primary aim is to ensure crop residues are destroyed onsite in the fields rather than being set ablaze.

SHOs have also been directed to coordinate closely with these committees to enforce preventive measures effectively. The order aligns with a Supreme Court of India directive issued last year, which called on states adjacent to Delhi—Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh—to stop crop burning immediately. The apex court stressed the need of holding SHOs accountable under the supervision of the respective state DGPs and chief secretaries."

A local resident stated that pollution in the city was worsening and action needed to be taken
The resident said ""The pollution in the city is getting worse. There are new cars and bikes everyday which are worsening the situation further. We need to take action on time, so that we can help the future generations.""
Sanjay Kathuria, another resident said that pollution was increasing daily and emphasized that measures needed to be taken by the public to address the issue

""The situation of pollution is worsening every day. It's not just in Mumbai but all over the country. It's going to get worse after Diwali and even taking a morning walk is becoming difficult now. We citizens should take proper measure to prevent the situation,"" said Kathuria.
On October 27, the city experienced its most severe air pollution, with an Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of 202, which falls under the 'poor' category.
According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the 'poor' AQI category, ranging from 201 to 300, can cause breathing discomfort for most people when exposed for an extended period.
On Sunday, various other monitoring stations across the city reported AQI levels falling within the 'moderate' category.
The 'moderate' AQI range, spanning from 101 to 200, has the potential to cause breathing discomfort for people with pre-existing lung, asthma, or heart conditions.
A visitor to Marine Drive expressed concern about the rising dust and pollution levels in the area.""This pollution is due to ongoing construction work here; it wasn't like this before. It's causing health issues. I come here daily because it feels refreshing, but now the dust and pollution have increased,"" the visitor said.
The air quality in several regions of Mumbai, including Byculla, Chembur, Chhatrapati Shivaji Intl. Airport, Deonar, Ghatkopar, and Kandivali West, was classified as 'moderate' based on the recorded Air Quality Index (AQI) levels. This category indicates a slightly elevated level of air pollution that may cause breathing discomfort for some individuals, particularly those with respiratory sensitivities.
On the other hand, air quality monitoring stations located in Colaba, Kandivali East, Mulund West, and Powai reported AQI levels falling under the 'satisfactory' category. An AQI ranging from 51 to 100 is considered satisfactory, suggesting that the air quality in these areas is generally acceptable."

Gurgaon: Low-grade fever to shortness of breath, chronic fatigue to palpitation — doctors in the city are increasingly getting complaints of acute respiratory illness from patients as the region has been grappling with air pollution and the onset of winter.
Not just the patients with comorbidities but also those with no prior health issues are presenting with symptoms such as low-grade fever, shortness of breath, fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, stomach pain, dizziness, and loose motions unrelated to digestion.
Health department data reveals a concerning trend. Between Nov 1 and 11, as many as 4,652 emergency cases of breathing issues were recorded in Gurgaon, of which 244 were acute respiratory illnesses. Among these, 192 patients required nebulisation.
In Oct, the city saw 16,016 emergency cases, with 636 related to acute respiratory illnesses. Of these, 488 patients required nebulisation, 353 needed hospital admission, 27 required non-invasive ventilation, and nine were put on invasive ventilation.

The data indicates a persistent and concerning presence of respiratory illnesses, likely exacerbated by environmental factors. Health officials have urged residents to take preventive measures, such as wearing masks and using air purifiers, to mitigate the impact of poor air quality on respiratory health.
The data indicates that respiratory illnesses persist at concerning levels, likely driven by environmental factors. Health officials recommend using masks and air purifiers to mitigate the impact of poor air quality.

Chief medical officer Dr Virender Yadav highlighted the seasonal surge in pneumonia cases, especially among children. ""We have launched the Social Awareness and Action to Neutralize Pneumonia Successfully (SAANS) program. Many patients with pre-existing respiratory issues are now being diagnosed with pneumonia and admitted to hospitals. There is a spike in lung ailment cases during winter when pollution levels are rising. New patients are primarily experiencing upper respiratory issues, which can progress to lower respiratory problems if not treated promptly. These symptoms may persist for two to three weeks and require medical attention,"" he said.
According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-V), around 65% of Indian children are exposed to unclean fuels, doubling their risk of pneumonia.
Doctors are also seeing a rise in atypical pneumonia cases. Dr Kuldeep Kumar Grover, Head of Critical Care and Pulmonology at CK Birla Hospital, explained, ""Typical pneumonia presents with clear signs like fever and yellow phlegm. Atypical pneumonia, however, manifests subtly, with symptoms such as chest pain, abdominal pain, or loose motions unrelated to digestion."""

Dr GC Khilnani, director of respiratory medicine at PSRI Hospital and ICS (north zone) chair, highlighted India's position among the world's most polluted nations. He pointed out that PM2.5 exposure exceeds WHO safety guidelines for over 99% of Indians, requiring urgent action to reduce pollution and strengthen medical facilities.
The health consequences are significant, with respiratory and cardiovascular conditions worsening when the air quality index turns hazardous, particularly affecting vulnerable groups. The Poseidon study, published in The Lancet in 2015, showed respiratory symptoms constitute over half of all medical consultations in India.

Dr Khilnani stressed the need for systematic improvements, particularly in developing comprehensive respiratory healthcare infrastructure, to address pollution-related medical challenges.
As the chairman of respiratory medicine, critical care and sleep medicine at Saroj Superspeciality Hospital and Jaipur Golden Hospital, and vice-president of ICS, Dr Rakesh Chawla emphasised how respiratory medicine departments are essential for diagnosing and treating complex breathing disorders while backing broader health initiatives.
He cautioned that removing these specialised departments would severely impact patient care, particularly in managing tuberculosis (TB), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pollution-related illnesses. Such actions would impede India's efforts to eradicate TB, he added.
Dr Chawla further noted that hospitals lacking dedicated respiratory units faced substantial constraints in providing thorough healthcare services and meeting the broader medical needs of the community.
WHO's Global TB Report 2024 highlights India's significant tuberculosis burden, revealing that the country represents 26% of the worldwide active TB cases. In 2023, India recorded the highest worldwide share of multidrug-resistant TB cases at 27% while also accounting for 26% of TB-related fatalities globally.
Dr Manoj Goel, principal director and head of the department of pulmonary medicine at Fortis Medical Research Institute, Gurgaon, also stressed the crucial requirement for accessible, high-quality respiratory healthcare services in the present circumstances."

According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) bulletin, Nagpur's overall AQI was in the poor category at 238 on Thursday. This was worse than cities like Mumbai, Pune, and Nashik, which were all in moderate category (below 200 mark).
At 7pm on Thursday, the continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS) at Ram Nagar showed highest AQI of 272, followed by Civil Lines 242, Mahal 238, and Ambazari 202. The average of all four stations is taken to estimate the city's overall air quality.
Particulate matter 2.5 levels in some areas covered by four air quality monitoring stations reached 300 and above in last couple of days. The city administration prepared a graded action response plan (GRAP), but little impact is seen on ground.
Worsening air quality also led to a spike in respiratory illnesses, with people allergic to dust and smoke, facing breathing difficulties and continuous coughing. Hema Deshpande, regional officer, MPCB, said ambient air quality dropped in the last couple of days due to a fall in temperature along with other polluting factors. ""Construction and demolition waste close to the monitoring station has affected air quality at Ambazari. Similarly, these activities elsewhere too are contributing to air pollution. We will review the situation and take suitable action,"" she said.

Nagpur municipal officials blamed it on increased vehicular and industrial pollution along with dust and smoke. ""Sanitary workers are regularly removing dust from roads and penalties are levied for open burning of waste,"" they said.
Paediatrician Dr Vivek Charde said respiratory illnesses went up in the last week. ""The drop in temperature since last few days, poor air quality, and viral infection are responsible for the spike. Children, especially with underlying asthma and other chronic lung problems, have an increased tendency to get infected. Asthmatic children need to be restarted on usual medications like inhalers as temperature will drop further,"" he said.

Lucknow: National Green Tribunal (NGT) guidelines are being ignored at several construction sites across Gomtinagar Extension, Kanpur Road and parts of the old city leading to rise in air pollution, reveals a reality check by TOI on Thursday.
Experts said this negligence was endangering public health.
As per NGT rules, construction materials like sand, bricks and cement must be covered to prevent dust, and measures like water sprinkling, dust barriers and proper waste disposal are mandatory. The rules also include usage of eco-friendly materials while vehicles leaving construction sites must be cleaned to avoid spreading dust on roads. Inspections and penalties are key to ensuring compliance.
However, the reality check revealed widespread violations.

In Gomtinagar Extension, particularly around Omaxe City, and in areas like Transportnagar, Chowk, Khadra, Balaganj and Thakurganj these measures were being ignored. Poor road conditions in some areas were further worsening the situation.
Residents are increasingly worried about the health impacts of unchecked pollution.
Vishal Sahu from Gomtinagar Extension said: ""Dust from construction is causing respiratory issues, especially for children and the elderly.""

Rajnarayan Singh from Transportnagar said: ""Life has become difficult with constant pollution. The govt must impose strict penalties on violators.""
Experts echo these concerns.
Prof Venkatesh Datta from BBAU's environmental sciences department called for stricter enforcement. ""Ignoring NGT guidelines is a grave issue that demands action. Public involvement is also crucial to ensure compliance,"" he said.
Prof RAS Kushwaha from KGMU's respiratory department said, ""Fine dust particles can cause respiratory problems like asthma, bronchitis and chronic lung diseases. Residents and workers must use protective masks, and construction sites must urgently implement dust control measures,"" he said.

Out of the Rs 199 crore spent, 72% was used to control and prevent road dust, followed by 14% on construction and demolition activities, 6.6% on vehicular emission, 4% on biomass burning, and 2.2% on awareness programmes. The three other Karnataka cities chosen for the programme are Davanagere, Hubballi-Dharwad, and Kalaburagi.
Admitting its inability to fully utilise the sanctioned amount, the state govt is said to have cited Covid-19 pandemic-induced restrictions, elections to the legislative assembly in 2023, and the parliamentary polls in 2024 as reasons for the underutilisation. In a detailed submission to the National Green Tribunal's southern zone bench,
Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) regional director J Chandra Babu said, ""According to the feedback from the local bodies of these four cities in Karnataka, the Covid-19 restrictions in the initial years, model code of conduct due to elections to the state assembly in 2023 and Lok Sabha in 2024 have impacted the progress in the utilisation of funds.""
CPCB also said the utilisation of funds under the NCAP programme is the responsibility of local bodies, including BBMP, with regular follow-ups by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board to ensure compliance as per the protocol under the national programme.
""It is not that the environment department has failed to use the allocated funds. We are only the channel as the funds are given to the urban development department through us.

Karnataka better than many other states: CPCB
Addressing the rising levels of air pollution across India, CPCB listed out 130 non-attainment and million-plus cities in 24 states and union territories. Any city that exceeded the PM10 concentration of 60µg/m3 for five consecutive years was identified as a non-attainment city (NAC), and four cities in Karnataka were considered as NACs. The NCAP objective is to reduce the PM10 concentration in these cities by 40% by 2025-26 from what it was in 2019-20.
Even though Karnataka failed to fully utilise the allocated funds, CPCB noted that the state's air quality standards are better than those of many others."

In a shocking report, WHO has estimated that air pollution is responsible for approximately 7 million premature deaths annually. Poor air quality has also reduced life expectancy by 4-5 years in Southeast Asia. The World Bank has estimated that economic losses in trillions of dollars will occur due to reduced health longevity caused by air pollution. As these figures send shockwaves amongst the entire population, it is imperative to understand the root cause of this problem.
In the past two centuries industrialization and urbanization have accelerated air pollution. Anthropogenic activities impact the atmosphere directly as they can reduce the environment's ability to provide ecosystem services and heal itself. These activities can be non-malicious like land use change, irrigation that can negatively impact soil properties, mining, building roads, vegetation removal. Intentional activities like deforestation, releasing industrial waste into air, vehicular pollution and other human development activities lead to intense air pollution. Delhi NCR becomes a gas chamber October onwards due to crop burning (parali) by farmers of nearby states. As the temperature drops, these pollutants mix with the air and stay on the surface causing a thick layer of smog, leading to hazy days and polluted air.

These anthropogenic activities are the main cause of air pollution. The increasing levels of pollutants like PM 2.5, NO2, sulphur dioxide, methane, and CO2 negatively impact human health. In the short term it leads to discomfort like itchy nose, throat and skin. It can also cause dizziness, headache, nausea etc. While many people complain of wheezing and difficulty in breathing, eye irritation is also a common complain. People suffering from bronchitis or pneumonia find it difficult to breathe, and show acute symptoms early on. Cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, cancer, mental health issues, and neurological diseases have risen due to poor air quality, and comprise of the long-term impact of air pollution. Children, senior citizens, people with respiratory or cardiovascular diseases and pregnant women are amongst those who are most impacted. Thus, pollution is not just lessening life expectancy but also worsening the quality of life.

In the past decade China faced a similar problem of increased pollution levels in Beijing. It actively worked on campaigns and took quick action to immediately curb pollution. It has reduced usage of coal, emphasizing on renewable energy sources, cutting down on plastic and took action to reduce PM 2.5 pollutants. In India too, Smart City projects aim to address air quality issues, as they build infrastructure based on sustainable resources and use sustainable sources of power like solar energy to run the city. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), implemented across 131 cities in 24 states since 2019 has played a crucial role in trying to curb the increasing pollution. The Air Quality Early Warning System is also in place and Cleaner Air and Better Health (CABH) Project too aims to create evidence based model. The Online Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems (OCEMS) keeps an eye on the changing pollution levels. To conclude, we can say that replicating such solutions across the country will ensure that the rising pollution levels can be kept under control.

Central govt’s Land and Development Ofﬁce (L&DO) razed numerous structures in Khyber Pass on Aug 4. The ravaged area bears a postapocalyptic look three months later.

Ramesh Talukdar, a motorcyclist who passes the locality daily on this way to work at Azadpur, wondered, “Why hasn’t the debris been cleared, particularly since it is adding to already severe pollution these days?” Two shopkeepers claimed they had to clean their establishments of the excessive dust twice every day.


Neither the prescribed protective nets or green construction sheets cover the dusty remnants of houses and shops, broken cement blocks and myriad bricks. No water sprinkling to settle the dust takes place. Even passers-by are at risk of accidents since no barricades have been put up to prevent the rubble from falling and injuring them.

Some people were rummaging through the waste for usable bricks. They said they lived in Majnu ka Tila nearby and were foraging for material to build their shacks. Keval Kisan and Hema Bhandari, who lost their home in the demolition, weren’t happy, saying bricks were being pilfered from the site for three months now.

With the air quality readings at the ‘severe’ levels and with GRAP-IV in force, most construction and demolition activities have been suspended. Restrictions have been imposed on diesel-powered medium and heavy goods vehicles (BS-IV or below) registered in Delhi, except those carrying essential items.

In the midst of these regulations, a continuous dust cover lingering over a north Delhi stretch appears to have gone unnoticed by civic authorities."

The Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi was recorded at 379 on Thursday morning. Several areas within the city, including Chandani Chowk, IGI Airport, and Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, reported 'very poor' air quality with AQI readings ranging from 338 to 394. However, some areas like Anand Vihar and Wazirpur remained in the 'severe' category with AQI readings exceeding 400.
The improved air quality brought some relief from the thick smog, although visibility remained low in several parts of the city.

Justin, a tourist from the USA, shared his experience: ""I'm from the USA and it's my second day in India. Before I came here, my friends from India warned me of 'smog' and pollution, but in spite of that, I wanted to visit New Delhi because it is such a beautiful city... with a rich history...Therefore I came here...I hope Delhi will overcome this pollution issue soon...""
Local residents expressed concern over the impact of pollution on their health and daily lives, urging the government to take action.


The severe air pollution has also impacted train schedules, causing delays and reschedulings.

Air pollution is regarded as causing impacts that would lead to the deterioration of respiratory and cardiovascular health, but recent research continues to claim that pollution increases the risk of stroke. While strokes are mostly associated with high blood pressure, cholesterol, and unhealthy lifestyles, the current available evidence is building to show that air pollution increases exposure to these situations and conditions that might lead or contribute to stroke.
How does air pollution affect the body?
Air pollution consists of numerous hazardous particles and gases. These include particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), and carbon monoxide (CO), which can all find entry pathways into the human body through the lungs and bloodstream. Of especial interest are the high concerns over particulate matter, especially PM2.5 because of their small size and thus possibility to penetrate deep into lung tissue and even blood flow. When these particles enter the blood, there can be inflammation and oxidative stress that are more capable of causing obstruction and even becoming hardened in blood vessels.

Recent studies have been made to establish a relationship between air pollution and stroke. Air pollution may not only disrupt the lungs but could also be pressurizing the cardiovascular system, resulting in high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, and hardening of arteries over time. All these contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including ischemic stroke, which is caused by a blood clot blocking the flow of blood to the brain.

The rate of developing stroke, especially the most common form of ischemic stroke, increases among residents who live in air pollution-designated areas according to a study published in The Lancet recently.
Short-term exposure and long-term exposure
Air pollution may cause immediate or short term and long effects on risks for stroke. The very short- term exposure like spending a few hours in a very polluted area, causes acute health effects especially to people who have pre-existing cardiovascular or respiratory disease; while the longer-term effect is the cumulative effect wherein after being presence within the body, continuously causing inflammation and oxidative stress to the blood vessels in the body which increases the risk for a stroke over time.

Air pollution is a broad problem that affects most people, but some groups are more vulnerable to it. Older adults, for example, have increased risks of having a stroke if exposed to air pollution because they might have pre-existing cardiovascular diseases or respiratory diseases. Highly polluted areas in the city where people stay also increase their risks of having a stroke because of air pollution. Also at risk are children and pregnant women. Pollution may adversely influence the development of the fetus and increase risks for developmental problems.

Prevention
Reducing exposure to air pollution is essential to reducing the risk of stroke. People can take personal measures such as wearing a mask on high pollution days, using air purifiers indoors and avoiding outdoor activities during peak pollution times. Governments and policy makers also play an important role in implementing stricter emissions standards and promoting green urban spaces.

Platforms must now remove firecracker listings, disable services for Delhi customers, and implement location-based restrictions to block sales and deliveries within the city.
They must also publish notices informing users about the ban and ensure delivery partners do not handle firecracker-related shipments.
This action follows a recent Supreme Court order on November 11th, mandating a firecracker ban to address rising air pollution.

The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) had already imposed a complete ban on the manufacture, storage, and bursting of all types of firecrackers in Delhi from October 14th, 2024 to January 1st, 2025.

In Nov so far, Delhi has witnessed seven severe days. Of these, the city has been reporting consecutive days of severe days since Nov 16, including two 'severe plus' days on Nov 18 and 19. With an AQI of 494, Nov 18 was the second most polluted day on record. In contrast, Nov last year saw nine severe days, but the longest consecutive streak was of four days. Dec 2023 saw three consecutive severe days. In 2022, Nov and Dec recorded a total of three and two severe days.

""Dry westerly and north-westerly winds are blowing in the region. These winds have thinned the layer of fog in north-west India, causing a rise in maximum temperature. The sun's rays were able to break through the sky, which reduced the smog conditions and hence, there was a slight improvement in the air quality,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice president at Skymet Meteorology. Central Pollution Control Board's data showed the AQI showed slight improvement throughout the day. It was 426 at 9 am and reached 419 at 4 pm but touched 405 at 8 pm.
The share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 was 19.82% on Monday, according to the Decision Support System. The lowest visibility of 600 metres was recorded at Palam at 8.30 am, which improved to 700 metres at 9 am. It further improved to 1,200 metres at 12.30 pm. The maximum temperature rose to 26.8 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal, on Wednesday. The minimum temperature dipped to 11.2 degrees Celsius, one degree below normal, making it the season's lowest so far."

But research suggests that increasing pollution has amplified some of these meteorological factors over the past few decades - which, in turn, may intensify smog further.
This pollution-weather loop is likely contributing to the current extreme haze in Delhi and other parts of the Indo-Gangetic plain, say experts. A study published last year showed that soot, black carbon and other kinds of aerosol pollution is magnifying the 'temperature inversion' effect often seen in winter, in which warm air traps colder air on the surface below, preventing pollution from dissipating. That's because these aerosols have a warming effect on the lower troposphere - the lowest part of the atmosphere - while cooling the air on the surface below.
Aerosol pollution raises the stability of the lower troposphere and aggravates the temperature inversion that is happening naturally, said Ritesh Gautam, a senior researcher at Environmental Defence Fund in the US, who led the study along with NASA researchers. ""This amplification effect seems to be strengthening decade on decade,"" Gautam said. The study found a nine-fold increase since 1980 in the number of days when visibility is less than 500 metres during Nov. There was a five-old increase in such days in Dec-Jan, including in Delhi.

Researchers looked at data over four decades to understand the interaction of pollution and atmosphere over the Indo-Gangetic plain. They found aerosol pollution in Nov increased by around 90% between 2002 and 2019, likely due to the rise of crop burning. Exceptionally high aerosol pollution rose in Dec-Jan, too, by around 40%.
Those two decades saw a correspondingly large warming of the lower troposphere. The stability in this layer also showed an increase, with the height of the planetary boundary layer dropping since 1980. This layer acts like a dome confining the pollution to the ground, so any increase in its stability or decrease in its height would prolong or intensify smoggy conditions on the ground.

""The stability does not allow air to move out,"" said S N Tripathi, a senior scientist at IIT Kanpur. Another factor is increased relative humidity, perhaps due to increased irrigation. More moisture in the air means more droplets of fog or smog can form. The study found a 20% rise in surface humidity since 1980.
All these factors are coming together to create a ""multiple whammy"" for Delhi and other parts of north India, said Gautam. ""You can't control the weather, but you can control the amount of pollution that is combining with the weather to produce this severe smog,"" he said.
The physics of this feedback cycle between pollution and atmospheric stability is known, but Gautam's study provides evidence of its effect over time, said Tripathi, who was not involved in that study. The long-term rise in lower tropospheric stability and relative humidity is also due to climate variability, said Chandra Venkatraman, an aerosol specialist at IIT Bombay. How much this meteorological change contributes to extreme smog is unclear.
Emissions remain the main driver of pollution, she noted. ""Unabated emissions and increased secondary aerosol production under high stability and relative humidity conditions is leading to the extreme PM2.5 conditions over north India and Pakistan,"" she said. Transboundary pollution may also be playing a role in Delhi's current crisis, said Tripathi, adding that there seems to be a large pollution spike over Lahore."

Individuals afflicted with COPD endure prolonged illness and potentially face mortality due to disease-related complications. COPD is predominantly preventable and manageable. The condition manifests through persistent respiratory difficulties resulting from alveolar anomalies caused by sustained exposure to airborne harmful particles. This precipitates breathing complications for affected individuals. The condition may lead to pulmonary inflammation, cardiac ailments, and bronchogenic carcinoma. These patients face elevated risks of pulmonary infections, influenza, pneumonia, lung cancer, and cardiac complications.
Healthcare institutions' counselling and awareness initiatives emphasised that COPD primarily stems from smoking and atmospheric pollution. Whilst incurable, the condition can be regulated through smoking cessation, pollution avoidance, lifestyle modifications, and consistent medical intervention. COPD manifestations include respiratory distress, persistent cough, and fatigue."

Lucknow: UP registered an alarming jump of 25% in the incidents of stubble burning in the current fiscal year, contributing significantly to the rise in air pollution in north India, especially in and around Delhi and the NCR region.
According to The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) data (updated till Nov 19), the state recorded 3,308 incidents of stubble burning, which was almost 25% more than in 2023 when 2,649 incidents were reported. Data shows that Maharajganj district registered the maximum number of 284 incidents of stubble burning, followed by Aligarh, where 173 incidents were reported.
In fact, Maharajganj saw the number of incidents of crop residue burning skyrocket from 89 in 2023 to 284—a jump of around three times.
The other districts where incidents were reported include Jhansi (167), Fatehpur (133), Shahjahanpur (127), Hardoi (122), Kanpur Dehat (119), and Etawah (118).

A senior official in the agriculture department affirmed that the number of incidents of stubble burning certainly grew. He, however, maintained that the incidents also involved the burning of agricultural waste. ""We are monitoring the situation on the ground closely and imposing fines accordingly,"" he said.
Madhya Pradesh happens to be at the top of six states being monitored by satellites in the matter of stubble burning.
Punjab is in second place, amid a strict stance adopted by the Supreme Court.
Satellite data shows that since Oct 28, the incidents of stubble burning increased in these six states. This resulted in thick smoke spreading over a large area of north and central India. On Nov 19, satellites detected 1,394 residue burning events. This included 664 incidents in MP, followed by 368 in UP, 270 in Punjab, 35 in Haryana, and 57 in Rajasthan. Not a single incident of stubble burning took place in Delhi.
Satellite monitoring of stubble burning incidents in fields started on Sep 15. During the period between Sep 15 and Nov 19, a total of 28,713 incidents of stubble burning were reported in these six states.
The report, prepared by the Consortium for Research on Space Monitoring and Modelling of Agro-ecosystems (CREAMS) Laboratory, reveals that Punjab and Haryana effectively stopped the incidents of stubble burning to a large extent.
Whereas incidents of stubble burning increased in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan in the same period.
The situation came to the fore despite the govt adopting a hard stance against the menace. It was earlier this month when the Centre decided to double the penalty on stubble burning.
The Centre is already extending financial support to the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and NCT of Delhi to address air pollution in Delhi & National Capital Region due to stubble burning.
During the current year, so far, funds amounting to Rs 275 crore have already been released to the states, out of a total allocation of Rs 600 crore.
The issue of stubble burning has been attaining political overtones, with Delhi CM Atishi Marlena categorically blaming the BJP-led central govt for doing politics over the issue of pollution but taking no step to check stubble burning in states like Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh—all ruled by the saffron party."

""As part of the curbs, all Delhi govt offices, barring essential services, will operate at 50% capacity. Private offices are also being directed to implement work-from-home for the convenience of employees,"" Rai said, adding that govt offices had already implemented staggered office hours to ease road congestion. An advisory is being issued to revise the hours in private offices too, he said.
He said, ""However, if Delhi acts alone while the BJP-ruled states in the neighbourhood ignore their responsibilities, clean air will remain out of reach.""

Eighteen essential and emergency services will work at full capacity, among these being medical services, solid waste management, cleaning and sanitation, community and public toilets, fire service, power, water supply and sewerage and public transport. This has been done to prevent inconvenience for the public.
On Wednesday, Rai held a meeting with govt departments and representatives of industry associations such as CII, Assocham and Ficci on implementing the work-from-home programme, staggering office timings and reducing vehicular use.
""We have issued advisories to industry associations, private companies and offices urging them to have 50% staff working from home and staggering their office timings to reduce peak-hour traffic,"" the minister said, pointing out that municipal offices now start in Delhi at 8.30am, central govt offices at 9am and Delhi govt offices at 10am and accordingly finish half an hour apart. ""In a similar manner, private offices should start operations at 10.30am or 11am to ease vehicular congestion on the roads,"" said Rai, also suggesting that private organisations could consider shuttle bus services for employees to reduce reliance on private vehicles.
He claimed that while Delhi govt was actively addressing the pollution problem, north India, with BJP govts in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana and at the Centre had failed to take adequate anti-pollution measures. ""If Delhi's AAP govt is working tirelessly to counter pollution levels but all six BJP-led govts around Delhi — five state govts and the central govt — work only to increase pollution, then it will likely be extremely difficult to fight pollution,"" he said. ""Therefore, my appeal is that all govts work jointly and swiftly on this issue."""

Earlier this year, Public Works Department (PWD) had started working on a new foot overbridge just beside the existing one to cater to the huge footfall in the area and the irreparable condition of the existing bridge, which is likely to be demolished after the new one is ready. The incomplete work is now leading to congestion on this section of Ring Road before the Wazirabad area.
The road stretch between the Majnu Ka Tila red light and Wazirabad flyover was being revamped for the last two years. To decongest the area in front of the monastery, changes were to be made to the road divider and reduce its width to make way for an extra lane.

The Air Quality Index(AQI) of the city shows no sign of relief anytime soon. On Wednesday, as per reports, the AQI across various areas reached 'Hazardous'. The Delhi Government has already implemented stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), as a response to this crisis.
Delhi's air pollution reached a hazardous level on Monday (November 18), with the city's AQI averaging 494, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). This marked the second-highest AQI recorded since the index was introduced in 2015. At the same time, international platforms like IQAir reported AQI values surpassing 1,600, leaving residents in a state of confusion: Which reading is correct? The answer, technically, is both.

In India, the AQI scale is capped at 500 and anything beyond that is classified as 'severe plus'. In an interview with the TOI, Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB's Air Laboratory Division informed, ""In our AQI scale, values from 451 to 500 fall in the ‘severe plus' category, which is considered the highest level of air emergency and corresponds to the strictest anti-pollution measures envisaged so far."" On the other hand, the Swiss company IQAir uses a US-based AQI model that lacks an upper limit and thus can report figures exceeding 500.

The US and Indian Air Quality Indexes (AQIs) calculate air quality using different formulas, which results in varying scores even when based on the same pollutant data. This makes direct comparisons between the two indexes difficult. Additionally, the measurement methods differ: IQAir’s AQI relies on sensor-based data, while India’s is analyzer-based, making the latter more accurate. IQAir’s data merges readings from its own sensors with those from government monitoring stations, highlighting the severity of the air quality crisis.

What is AQI?
AQI, or Air Quality Index, is a numerical scale used to communicate the quality of the air and its potential health impacts. It measures the concentration of various air pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. The AQI scale typically ranges from 0 to 500, with higher values indicating worse air quality and greater potential for health risks. An AQI value of 0 to 50 indicates good air quality, while values above 300 are considered hazardous."

Patna: Doctors have warned that bad ambient air quality on account of many factors, including emissions from thermal power plants, is toxic for human health that can lead to severe health complications. They say that children and elderly people are more at risk as their immunity is weaker in comparison to the younger adult population.
Executive director of Mahavir Arogya Sansthan, Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, says air quality in general and SO2 (sulphur dioxide) in particular have disastrous impacts on human health, especially children below 10 years and the elderly people.
""Children are mostly affected because their respiratory system, along with other body parts, are still in preparatory stage, while the elderly people's organs are more compromised because of old age. These pollutants hammer hit their vulnerable bodies,"" says Singh, adding continuous exposure to such polluted air for over 30 days may start impacting elasticity of lungs, as it has to struggle a lot to pump in more of pure oxygen needed by blood.
Former president of Indian Medical Association (Bihar), Dr Ajay Kumar, echoes Dr Prasad: ""Pollutant gases like SO2 are extremely damaging to human lungs and prolonged exposure could even lead to respiratory failure. These pollutant gases are obviously more dangerous for the children and elderly people, but the entire population is at risk. Besides directly affecting lungs, these impurities present in the air also affect normal brain functioning, may also lead to asthma and gastrointestinal abnormalities affecting digestion among humans,"" says Kumar.

Director of respiratory and sleep medicine at a private hospital in Patna, Dr Saket Sharma, says lungs are one of the most exposed and vulnerable organs to environmental pollution and the interrelationship results in respiratory morbidity. ""Air pollution due to presence of SO2, hydrocarbons, PM 2.5 and other pollutants are directly responsible for lung ailments, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, worsening of asthma and airway hyper reactivity, and may even lead to lung cancer,"" says Sharma.
He adds indirect impact is visible in form of compromised defence system of lungs, making them more susceptible to various viral and bacterial infections, which may further aggravate the underlying condition."

According to the data, published earlier this week, the thermal power plants in Bihar emit 181 kilotonnes of SO2 annually, which is around 10 times more than the 17.8 kilotonnes emitted by burning of 8.9 million tonnes of paddy straw in Punjab and Haryana.
The FGD is a set of technologies that remove SO2 and other sulphur compounds from exhaust gases produced by fossil fuel power plants. An analyst at CREA, Manoj Kumar, said SO2 eventually gets converted into sulphate, secondary particles which are a major component of PM2.5, affecting the air quality. These secondary particles also have a longer lifetime and pose serious health risks.
According to the report, had the FGD system been fully implemented in the six plants, SO2 emissions could be reduced by an estimated 62%, from 181 kilotonnes per year to 68 kilotonnes per year. Plant-wise analysis showed that emissions from Barh thermal plant could be reduced by around 80%, from 63 to 13 kilotonnes per year. Similarly, at Nabinagar Super Thermal Power Project, SO2 could be reduced by 66% from 43 to 15 kilotonnes per year.
The CREA also compared the data of SO2 in Bihar with other states like Punjab and Haryana, which are always in limelight for paddy straw burning.

""While paddy straw burning causes seasonal spikes, thermal power plants represent a larger, persistent pollution source year-round, underscoring the need for stricter control on thermal power plant emissions,"" read a part of the report.
State environment, forest and climate change department minister Prem Kumar said he will call for a review meeting on air pollution, which several cities in the state are facing, around November 25. ""The lack of an FGD system will also be scrutinised. If it is not present in the thermal power plants, then authorities have to answer why they are missing and what action has been taken so far. Also, the state pollution control board will have to present its action plan to tackle the air crisis the state is facing. Environment plays an important role in one's health, and this issue of air pollution needs to be resolved,"" said Kumar."

The research focused on Shahid Smritivan, a 19,000 sq. ft. green space established in 2019 by environmentalist Viral Desai. The study recorded a notable reduction in particulate matter, with PM10 levels dropping by 18.85% and PM2.5 by 10.66% in the surrounding areas over a three-month period.
""Cities grappling with poor air quality can replicate such initiatives to tackle pollution and mitigate urban heat,"" Desai remarked, emphasizing the importance of urban forests as sustainable solutions for urban environmental challenges.
The forest, which houses over 1,500 native trees, has transformed into a thriving ecosystem, attracting birds, insects, and reptiles. According to researcher Yugmi Patel, the success stems from using native species known for their adaptability and environmental benefits.

As Delhi-NCR battles dangerous air quality levels with AQI crossing 450, air purifiers have shifted from luxury to necessity. In the capital region's fight against toxic air, these devices offer a crucial defense for indoor spaces. However, the urgency to protect family health often leads to rushed purchases and expensive mistakes.
Before you invest in an air purifier, it's essential to understand what makes these devices effective. From choosing the right size to understanding filtration technology, several factors determine whether your purchase will actually clean your air or just clean out your wallet. Here are the critical mistakes to avoid while buying an air purifier.
Getting the size wrong and ignoring room dimensions

The most common mistake someone could make is choosing an air purifier without considering room size. In the rush to combat pollution, many buyers pick units that are either too small to effectively clean their space or unnecessarily large for their rooms. A small unit will struggle continuously and never achieve optimal air quality, while an oversized one wastes energy and money. Before purchasing, measure your room's square footage and match it with the purifier's coverage area. For Delhi's heavily polluted air, experts recommend choosing a purifier rated for a slightly larger area than your actual room size to ensure effective cleaning.

Falling for marketing gimmicks and HEPA-like claims

In Delhi's competitive air purifier market, many brands use clever marketing terms like ""HEPA-type"" or ""HEPA-style"" filters. These terms are red flags – they indicate filters that don't meet true HEPA standards and can't effectively combat Delhi's dangerous PM2.5 pollutants. True HEPA filters, certified to remove 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns, are essential for Delhi's pollution levels. Don't compromise on this feature, even if it means paying a bit more.

Overlooking technical specifications and CADR ratings

Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) is crucial, yet often ignored in favor of brand names or attractive features. In Delhi's severe pollution, a higher CADR rating is essential for rapid air cleaning. Look for models with CADR ratings above 200 m³/hour for medium-sized rooms. Remember, Delhi's air quality can deteriorate rapidly, and your purifier needs sufficient power to respond effectively.
Underestimating long-term costs and maintenance

Many Delhi residents focus solely on the purchase price, forgetting the significant running costs of air purifiers. Factor in regular filter replacements (especially frequent during peak pollution months), electricity consumption, and maintenance costs. Calculate the total cost of ownership over at least two years, including peak pollution season requirements. Some cheaper models actually cost more in the long run due to frequent filter replacements and higher energy consumption.
Poor placement and setup mistakes

Even the most expensive air purifier won't perform effectively if poorly placed. Avoid tucking units into corners or behind furniture. Proper placement is critical - keep the purifier at least 2 feet away from walls, away from furniture obstacles, and in rooms where you spend most time. For Delhi homes, consider placing units near but not directly under air conditioning vents, as this helps with air circulation while avoiding direct interference with the purifier's airflow.
Noise considerations and 24/7 operation

Given Delhi's pollution levels, your air purifier needs to run continuously. Many buyers overlook noise ratings, leading to disturbed sleep and everyday discomfort. Look for units that operate below 50 decibels on normal settings, and ensure they have a quiet night mode. Test different speed settings before buying, as you'll be living with this sound around the clock during pollution seasons.
Inadequate filtration systems for Delhi's complex pollution

Delhi's air contains a complex mix of pollutants - from PM2.5 to gases, smoke, and seasonal allergies. Single-filter systems often prove inadequate. Look for purifiers with multiple filtration stages: a pre-filter for larger particles, True HEPA filter for fine particles, and activated carbon for gases and odours. Some advanced models also offer anti-bacterial treatment, particularly useful during Delhi's smog seasons.
Missing air quality monitoring features

Without real-time monitoring, you can't gauge your purifier's effectiveness as Delhi's air quality fluctuates. Choose models with PM2.5 indicators, air quality monitoring, and auto-mode functionality. Smart connectivity features, while not essential, can help you track air quality trends and adjust settings remotely.
Neglecting filter maintenance schedules

Many users continue using expired filters, severely compromising air purification. Delhi's high pollution levels mean filters may need more frequent replacement than manufacturer standards suggest. Keep track of filter life, maintain a replacement schedule, and clean pre-filters regularly. Consider keeping spare filters during peak pollution seasons when demands on the purifier are highest.
Price-based decisions without research

Either choosing the cheapest option or assuming the most expensive model is best - both are mistakes common during Delhi's pollution emergencies. Set a realistic budget between ₹8,500 to ₹65,000, but focus on getting the right features for your specific needs. Consider the manufacturer's service network in Delhi-NCR, warranty terms, and verified user reviews from local users who understand the unique challenges of Delhi's air quality.
Remember, an air purifier is a crucial health investment in Delhi's battle against air pollution. Take time to research and choose the right model rather than making panic purchases during severe pollution episodes. Combine your air purifier with proper room sealing, regular maintenance, and other protective measures for the best results in Delhi's challenging air quality conditions.
FAQs: Air purifier buying guide

Do I need to run my air purifier 24/7?

For optimal air quality, yes. Air purifiers work best when operated continuously, as indoor air is constantly being contaminated by new particles. However, you can run them at lower speeds during quiet hours to reduce noise and energy consumption. Modern units are designed for continuous operation and typically consume minimal electricity - about 1/40th of what an air conditioner uses.
How do I know when to replace the filters?

Most modern air purifiers come with filter replacement indicators that light up when filters need changing. As a general rule:
HEPA filters: Replace every 6-12 months
Carbon filters: Replace every 3-4 months
Pre-filters: Clean monthly and replace every 6 months However, if you live in a highly polluted area or have pets, you might need to replace filters more frequently.
Can one air purifier clean my entire home?

No, air purifiers are most effective in single, closed rooms. Their effectiveness decreases significantly in open floor plans or when trying to purify multiple rooms. For best results, place air purifiers in rooms where you spend the most time (like bedrooms and living rooms) and consider multiple units for larger homes.
Will an air purifier help with allergies and asthma?

Yes, air purifiers with True HEPA filters can significantly help allergy and asthma sufferers by removing common triggers like pollen, pet dander, dust mites, and other airborne allergens. However, they should be used as part of a comprehensive approach that includes regular cleaning and controlling allergen sources.
Do air purifiers remove smoke and cooking odours?

Air purifiers with both HEPA and activated carbon filters can effectively remove smoke particles and cooking odours. The HEPA filter captures the smoke particles, while the activated carbon filter absorbs odours and gases. However, for best results with strong cooking odours, ventilation (like range hoods or open windows) should be used in combination with air purifiers.
What's the difference between ""True HEPA"" and ""HEPA-type"" filters?

True HEPA filters are certified to remove 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns, following strict testing standards. ""HEPA-type"" or ""HEPA-like"" filters are marketing terms for filters that don't meet these certification standards and may be significantly less effective. Always look for ""True HEPA"" certification when choosing an air purifier for the best performance."

A proposed solution to Delhi's severe air pollution crisis,"Nov 20, 2024, 12:26 IST","As Delhi faces an escalating air pollution crisis, the idea of cloud seeding, or artificial rain, has been proposed as a potential short-term solution to improve the city's hazardous air quality. The air quality index (AQI) in Delhi has remained in the ""severe plus"" category for several days, with AQI readings consistently surpassing 450, signalling extreme pollution levels.
In response to this, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai has called on the Central government for assistance, urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to facilitate the use of cloud seeding to help mitigate the growing pollution problem. The Delhi government has been exploring cloud seeding as a possible method to reduce the harmful effects of air pollution.

What is cloud seeding or artificial rain?

Cloud seeding is a weather modification technique designed to increase precipitation by introducing specific substances into clouds, encouraging the formation of rain or snow. Common materials used in the process include silver iodide, potassium iodide, and dry ice. These substances act as nuclei around which water droplets can form, potentially enhancing precipitation.

Cloud seeding can be carried out using various methods, such as aircraft, ground-based generators, or even rockets. In the context of air pollution, the primary goal is to ""wash away"" pollutants from the atmosphere. The theory is that increased rainfall could help settle dust, particulate matter, and other airborne pollutants, providing temporary relief from the city's dangerous air quality.
The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur has proposed a cloud seeding project to the Delhi government, estimating the cost of the initiative at about Rs 1 lakh per square kilometre.

Is artificial rain effective?

The effectiveness of cloud seeding in improving air quality remains a point of debate among scientists. Some studies suggest that cloud seeding can modestly increase rainfall, but the impact on air pollution is less clear. While it may help temporarily reduce particulate matter in the air, it does not address the root causes of pollution, such as industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and construction dust.
Experts caution that cloud seeding should not be viewed as a permanent solution to Delhi’s air quality issues. The technique is not universally effective and depends on certain atmospheric conditions, such as the presence of clouds with sufficient moisture. Given Delhi's current weather patterns, experts note that the likelihood of successful cloud seeding operations may be limited.
Additionally, there are environmental concerns about the long-term effects of introducing chemicals into the atmosphere. Some experts argue that cloud seeding may have unintended consequences and that efforts should be focused on reducing emissions and enforcing stricter pollution control measures rather than relying on technological fixes.
Future of cloud seeding in Delhi

As Delhi continues to search for ways to combat its persistent air pollution, cloud seeding remains an area of interest, though its role in providing lasting solutions is uncertain. While it might offer short-term relief by temporarily clearing the air, experts emphasise that addressing the root causes of air pollution through long-term strategies is crucial for sustainable improvement in the city’s air quality.

Even the Decision Support System (DSS), which forecasts Delhi's AQI and calculates the contribution of stubble burning in the city's PM2.5, changed the data of the past few days. For instance, it estimated that the share of farm fires was 37.5% on Friday, the highest this season, but it was later changed to 21.5%. Officials said the model did not factor in the high number of weddings in Delhi-NCR, leading to the bursting of firecrackers. The data since Nov 12 for stubble contribution was, therefore, revised considering the raw data on marriage ceremonies and emissions from firecrackers, they added.

Both DSS and Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi (EWS), which forecasts air quality, have been developed by Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (ITM) and use the same model.
An analysis of EWS forecasts reveals that from Nov 13 to Nov 19, the forecasts were wrong on five days out of seven. Stage III of Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) was also not imposed on Nov 13 when air quality turned 'severe', as AQI was predicted to improve to 'very poor'. The decision to impose stage III was taken only on Nov 14.
Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Research and Advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said, ""A severe episode has started, but we lack the much-needed reliable forecasts. It impacts our preparedness for emergency action. GRAP's stage IV was imposed after AQI turned 'severe plus'. We need a stronger forecasting system for efficient decision-making.""
Another official also attributed the inaccurate forecasts to the wedding season which started on Nov 12, and said the figures for contribution of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 have since been revised.
""The model was unable to capture the additional emissions from firecrackers due to the ongoing wedding season. According to news reports, about 50,000 weddings took place on Nov 12 in Delhi. However, there was no drastic increase in other sources. Even the meteorological conditions did not show any significant changes. We estimated that air quality was impacted as marriage ceremonies led to the bursting of firecrackers,"" said a senior scientist in the know of the matter.
The scientist added that they estimated that on an average, about 50 crackers were burst in one wedding. ""We also removed false fires recorded due to fog. We re-ran the model from Nov 12 onwards, considering firecrackers, and revised the contribution of stubble burning,"" the scientist said, adding that they plan to consider wedding seasons and firecrackers in future calculations.
Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst, Envirocatalysts, said, ""The air quality forecast for Delhi is based on the 2021 emission inventory, which is outdated. Episodic events such as stubble burning are changing in nature and intensities, leading to wrong forecasts. There is a need to refine the methodology and base data, if forecasts are to be more accurate and meaningful.""
Dahiya added that events such as firecracker bursting during weddings can't be predicted well to be incorporated into air pollution forecasts, which will always lead to minor deviations in actual versus predicted levels, but all other sources can be predicted fairly accurately using the latest data and methodologies.
""Please be aware that the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi's PM2.5 concentration for the day is determined using active fire count data from the VIIRS satellite-based instrument received until the previous evening. The estimates of the contribution from stubble burning for Nov 13, 14, and 15 are revised by taking into account the emissions from the bursting of firecrackers in Delhi (as part of wedding celebrations), which were not taken into consideration earlier,"" stated a disclaimer on the DSS website."

Immediate relief unlikely, GRAP-IV to stay in force at least till Monday
Delhi’s average AQI was 484 at 9am on Tuesday, which by noon had improved to 473 and to 464 by 3pm.

According to weather analysts, Delhi had seen dense fog on Monday, leading to intensive trapping of pollutants as the fog cover persisted for a longer time.
Al though the fog moved towards to west UP, pollution levels may see no significant change due to low wind speed and high moisture in the air. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Safdarjung saw a minimum visibility of 600m while Palam saw 1000m on Tuesday.
“City saw north-westerly and westerly winds up to 6-8kmph on Tuesday. On Monday, the dense fog layer entered the city from Punjab and Haryana, which made dispersion difficult. The fog has shifted though the city still saw shallow fog and mist, so there is no significant improvement in AQI for now.

The minister emphasized that govt of the neighboring states should sit together to tackle this alarming situation without involving in politics.
""It is becoming difficult to live in Gurgaon; how will people survive in such high AQI?"" he said, suggesting that authorities must use artificial rain to deal with the high pollution. Stubble burning, Narbir, said is a major cause that contributes to the pollution.

Lauding the state govt for providing incentives to farmers to avoid stubble burning, he attacked the Punjab govt saying, that no such scheme has been implemented by AAP govt.
""I don't want to blame anyone, but we are also responsible; our farmers are burning parali in Punjab, and many districts of NCR are getting affected by pollution,"" said Narbir.
After forming govt in Delhi and Punjab, aam aadmi party leaders are now blaming Haryana and UP. Earlier, they used to blame Punjab for pollution in Delhi, he said. ""If this continues, then the lifespan of our coming generation will be reduced,"" said Narbir.

""NCR will see exodus if the pollution continues to remain this,"" said Narbir, adding that Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi need to work together.

One of the leading causes of this deadly lung condition is air pollution itself-a carrier of harmful particulates and gases-presented in vast quantities into the atmosphere.
What Is COPD?
COPD is a chronic respiratory disease that causes air flow obstructions and entails symptoms like breathlessness, persistent cough, and frequent respiratory infections. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are some of the conditions comprising COPD. Smoking has historically been regarded as the primary cause of COPD; however, environmental factors and in particular air pollution, have recently gained relevance in this regard.
The major threat to people suffering from COPD is polluted air. Even short exposures to pollutants can cause exacerbation, the worsening of symptoms, increased hospital admissions, and progression of the disease. Long-term exposure will cause irreparable damage to the lungs, making treatment much harder.
What can be done?
To alleviate the influence of air pollution on COPD, immediate steps need to be taken. Governments have to bring tougher air quality standards while promoting cleaner energy and investing more in green infrastructure. Individual efforts also include using air purifiers, wearing masks, and avoiding outdoor activities when levels are at a pollution peak.

The air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 332 at 1pm on Tuesday, comparable with cities like Mumbai. An AQI of 332 is considered as ‘severe’ on the pollution scale. Over the last month, even during other times of the day, the average AQI has been around 103, still classified as ‘poor’.
AQI India noted that “breathing the air in this location is as harmful as smoking 3.0 cigarettes a day”. The Goa pollution control board attributed the reason for the capital city’s choking to rapid urbanisation, which is putting strain on its once-untouched environment.
Even interior areas of Curchorem and Loutolim recorded ‘poor’ air quality.
“The AQI of Goa is not at alarming levels. It is well below the permissible limit. The AQI of Panaji is high, it can be attributed to vehicle-generated pollutants, construction works and winter season (lack of windspeed and moisture in air),” said Mahesh Patil, chairman of the board.

“Breathing may become slightly uncomfortable, especially for those with respiratory issues,” the AQI India website said of the poor air quality in Panaji on Tuesday. During the night hours in Goa over the last one month, the AQI did drop to 95 or lower, which is still considered moderate, rarely recording ‘good’ levels.
According to GSPCB’s own data, AQI in Panaji records on Oct 11 and Nov 11 show an increase in pollution levels in the area, with both PM10 and PM2.5 levels having gone up. These are tiny particles in the air that we can’t see, but they can hurt our lungs. On Oct 11, the PM10 level was 97 and PM2.5 was 63. By Nov 11, these numbers went up to 104 for PM10 and 71 for PM2.5. These are above safe levels.

NOx (Nitrogen Oxides) come from cars and factories. They went up from 32.3 to 38.4 in just a month. These gases make air dirty and can cause breathing problems.
“In all these years, we have never seen so much dust in Panaji. The smart city project, which includes extensive digging of sewage chambers and repeated roadwork, could be a contributor to dust and air pollution surge,” said environmental activist and Panaji resident Avertino Miranda.
“Besides, there is a rise in carbon monoxide emissions from the density of vehicles in the city which includes the locals entering the city as well as tourists exploring Panaji. There is no control over commercial vehicles coming to Panaji either. We are not regulating or imposing restrictions on the vehicular population in the city, which will lead to the collapse of the carrying capacity of Panaji,"" he added."

NOIDA: Toxic smog, which triggered near zero visibility at many places and pile-ups on highways, hung over the city on Tuesday even though the overall air quality index slipped to the upper levels of the ‘very poor' zone at 370. In Ghaziabad too, the smog curtain persisted through the day due to calm wind conditions and pollution levels kept soaring as the day passed to settle at 434 (severe).
The two NCR cities of UP had recorded the season's first ‘severe' smog on Monday. While Noida's AQI touched 423, Ghaziabad's was 438. This was just a shade better than Delhi's 494 and Gurgaon's 469. Delhi's average AQI on Tuesday was 460 and Gurgaon's 402 (severe). Greater Noida's AQI was 372 on both days.
According to weather analysts, Delhi-NCR had seen dense fog on Monday, leading to intensive trapping of pollutants as the fog cover persisted for a longer time. Although the fog moved towards west UP, pollution levels may see no significant change due to low wind speed and high moisture in the air.
""On Monday, the dense fog layer entered Delhi from Punjab and Haryana, which made dispersion difficult. The fog has shifted, though the city still saw shallow fog and mist, so there is no significant improvement in AQI for now. The weather conditions will also be the same for the next few days,"" said Mahesh Palwat, vice chairman, Climate Change and Meteorology, Skymet.

Meanwhile, air quality at the Sector 62 monitoring station in Noida, that covers industrial and commercial areas off the DME, continued to be recorded at ‘hazardous' levels. At 4pm, its average 24-hour AQI was 448 even as the PM 2.5 concentrations had reached 500 µg/m³. The average AQI at Sector 1 station, which also covers several industrial sectors, was 335. In sectors 116 and 125, it was 366 and 332, respectively.

In Ghaziabad, the average air quality in Loni was 476, the worst in the district, while Vasundhara logged 444, Sanjay Nagar 440 and Indirapuram 375. Residents also complained of a sharp and pungent smell throughout the day. Videos shared on social media by residents, especially from condominiums in Raj Nagar Extension, showed buildings shrouded in a thick layer of smog.
""A fire has been raging for the last three days on a vacant plot located near Brave Hearts Society in RNE. The resulting smoke, combined with smog, has engulfed the entire township. The situation remains unaddressed,"" RNE resident Deepanshu Mittal said.
The civic corporation, however, claimed they were actively working on complaints related to garbage burning. ""The department has filed several complaints, seeking stringent action against individuals involved in burning garbage. We have also shut down 21 tandoors at various eateries,"" a GMC official said.
NK Chaudhary, GMC chief engineer, said the corporation had implemented stringent measures against construction materials left exposed across all five zones and collected Rs 94,000 in fines.
Noida Authority, meanwhile, said water was being sprinkled by its five tankers on 100 to 125 km stretches every day to check road dust — a key source of pollution — and it would be amped up further. Grap 4 measures continue to be in force since Monday."

Earlier this year, he often felt breathless. After a few scary bouts, he saw a pulmonologist who diagnosed the condition as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Now, Parmar not only wears a mask while going out, but has also reduced his travels to GIDC. One of the major reasons for Parmar, a non-smoker, developing the condition was the air he was breathing.
On World COPD Day, observed annually on Nov 20, city pulmonologists reported that non-smokers constitute 20% of total COPD cases.
Dr Tushar Patel, former president of Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA) and a pulmonologist, said that air quality is one of the major contributors today to the condition in urban areas where commuters are exposed to both fumes and particulate matter.
""Breathlessness and incessant coughing are often associated with long-term smokers. COPD classically was a disease that set in after the 50s and 60s. But now it is not uncommon to see patients in their early thirties with the symptoms of what we call ‘smoker's lungs',"" said Dr Shachi Dave, a pulmonologist with a city hospital.

Dr Nikita Rajguru, a pulmonologist, said that prolonged exposure to pollution and fumes, even those in indoor environments, can cause lung injuries and inflammation. ""Pollution in Delhi has put the air quality in sharp focus, and we do see aggravated conditions or onset of COPD due to prolonged exposure. It depends on several factors, though,"" she said, adding that wearing face masks can help reduce exposure.

Though smoking is still the most common cause of lung cancer, epidemiological evidence now indicates that air pollution, particularly PM2.5, also significantly contributes to the incidence, even among non-smokers.
Dr. Sudhir Palsaniya, Consultant Medical Oncologist, Shalby Jaipur, explains that prolonged exposure to PM2.5 can trigger inflammatory reactions in pulmonary cells, which might subsequently lead to the development of cancer. This scenario is pretty alarming for people staying in urban areas with higher vehicle and industrial pollution levels.
The Science Behind the Connection
Exposure to air pollution damages lung tissue while promoting tumor growth. PM2.5 refers to fine particulate matter that has a size of less than 2.5 micrometers. The penetration level of this matter within the respiratory system is quite very high. These particulates work like promoters, which brings cell mutations to become malignant cancerous cells. Doctors Shalby Hospital, Jaipur, says ""Even nonsmokers have fallen prey to it. That is to say, air pollution has gone to such a level that whether you are a smoker or a nonsmoker doesn't matter.""

A Growing Concern in India
India is one of the worst countries for increasing pollution. Major cities like Ahmedabad, Mumbai, and Delhi often record an unsafe air quality index. Industrial emissions, car exhausts, and biomass combustion have increased respiratory and cancer disease cases. The fine particulate matter, mainly from vehicles, industrial activities, and dust from construction materials, enters the lungs, causes further inflammation, and increases the chances of oncogenic changes. With a fast-growing urban population and little emission control, the scenario demands emergency action through stricter laws, public awareness, and robust healthcare infrastructure to reduce its effects.

Early Detection Is Important
Symptoms most often common to lung cancer- persistent coughing, chest pain, and dyspnea- often coincide with symptoms of other respiratory conditions. Shalby Hospital explains how early diagnosis is significant: High-tech diagnostic imaging, such as low-dose computed tomography, can improve the prognosis of patients. Advanced diagnostics such as LDCT scans allow improving patients' survival chances.
Taking Action
While it is great to support clean air initiatives, personally taking action matters the most, recommends Dr. Sudhir Palsaniya, Consultant Medical Oncologist, Shalby Jaipur.
⦁ Reduce outdoor activities during periods of pollution.
⦁ Using air purifiers indoors.
⦁ Advocate for stringent emission control and sustainable development in cities.
At Shalby Hospital, we dreamed of an awareness for air pollution and its association with lung cancer. We continue to strive to reduce the burden of disease with advanced diagnostic tools and excellent care.

The move has left countless passengers stranded and has severely disrupted the state's road transport network.
Over 400 buses from Garhwal and Kumaon divisions operate daily on the Delhi route. However, with the ban on BS-IV diesel vehicles in the Delhi-NCR region, UTC suspended operations for these buses, leaving only 269 vehicles—comprising 180 CNG, 12 BS-6 Volvo, and 77 BS-6 ordinary buses—to operate on the route.
""The reduction in services to Delhi will inconvenience passengers, especially those travelling from rural areas. To mitigate this, BS-VI buses operating on local routes are being reassigned to the Delhi route,"" said Pawan Mehra, general manager (operations), UTC.
Meanwhile, private operators took advantage of the reduced services, hiking fares significantly for stranded passengers. UTC Employees' Union president Ashok Chaudhary accused private operators of exploiting the situation, running luxury buses illegally under All India Carriage permits. ""These buses cannot carry individual passengers, and their online ticket booking is completely illegal, yet they operate with the connivance of senior officials,"" he said.

Chief secretary Radha Raturi directed UTC to implement a short-term action plan, including increasing bus frequency to Delhi, particularly on weekends. Coordination with Uttar Pradesh for additional services to Kaushambi and Mohan Nagar in Ghaziabad is also being explored.
The transport department has been instructed to expedite the operation of 100 CNG buses, with 30 already received. Proposals to purchase 175 new buses are under consideration. Buses meeting pollution control standards will continue to Delhi, while others will terminate at border points like Kaushambi and Mohan Nagar.
Before the ban, 504 daily services operated on the Delhi route, contributing over 60% of UTC's revenue. With only 310 buses now running, officials estimate a daily revenue loss of Rs 30 lakh.
Passengers, however, continue to bear the brunt of the reduced services. Depots across rural areas witnessed chaos, with overcrowded buses and long wait times.

As per the CPCB, an AQI above 200 can cause breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure, while the ""severe"" air quality can affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases.
Nabin, meanwhile, emphasised the need for increased sprinkling of water and plantation efforts.
""A joint meeting of urban development and housing department, and environment and forest department, was held a few days ago to discuss the rising levels of air pollution, when the PMC was instructed to properly implement and monitor central and state climate action plans.

In light of the escalating air pollution crisis in Delhi, the Public Transport Forum Delhi (PTF) and Greenpeace India have called on the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to implement a ""Clean Air Concession"" to make metro fares more affordable during periods of severe air pollution. This initiative is aimed at reducing dependency on private vehicles and encouraging citizens to opt for the Delhi Metro, a cleaner and more efficient mode of transport.
Delhi’s air quality has reached alarming levels, with AQI often crossing into hazardous categories. Different studies suggest that transport emissions are one of the major contributors to the air pollution crisis in Delhi. Private vehicles contribute to 51.5% of Delhi's locally generated emissions, exacerbating the particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels.
According to a recent report by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), public transport users face substantially higher journey costs compared to private vehicle users, largely due to hidden costs such as time spent waiting and interchanges, especially for bus journeys. The comparative cost per kilometer for different modes reveals that buses cost Rs. 40/km and the metro Rs. 47/km, while two-wheelers and cars cost Rs. 16/km and Rs. 35/km respectively. Moreover, approximately 50% of public transport users spend 18% of their annual income on transportation, while private vehicle users spend just 12%.

“As Delhi is grappling with high pollution levels, the role of Delhi metro becomes essential in providing affordable public transportation to the people of Delhi. Reduced fares, increase in frequency and extension of peak hours during high pollution days in Delhi will encourage more people to use the Delhi metro and subsequently reduce the reliance on private vehicular transport”, said Aakiz Farooq, Campaigner, Greenpeace India.

The proposed “Clean Air Concession” outlines measures to make public transport more accessible and appealing. It recommends reducing metro fares by 20-30% during periods of severe air pollution to encourage a shift from private vehicles. Increased train frequency and extended peak travel hours on high-pollution days are also suggested to handle the anticipated rise in ridership and improve passenger convenience.
The need for more affordable public transit options to address environmental challenges keeping in view the economic context of the city is critical. Currently, travel in buses is free for women and there are discount passes for students, physically disabled and senior citizens in Delhi. “Our study on the impact of free buses for women shows that one in four women have started using buses more often after the scheme. So, making public transport more affordable or free clearly has direct benefits of increasing its use. Sadly, no such concessions exist for Delhi Metro which is even less affordable for a large section of regular commuters in the city. At least, in this season of hazardous air quality, Metro can reduce its fares to incentivise people to use metro rather than cars and motorcycles.”, said Nishant, one of the coordinators of the Public Transport Forum, an independent collective of citizens and civil society organizations.
Improving first and last-mile connectivity is another priority. The proposal urges DMRC to reintroduce and expand metro feeder bus services and collaborate with initiatives like the Delhi Government’s Mohalla Bus scheme to ensure better access to metro stations, especially for underserved areas. Additionally, it advocates for a fully integrated public transport system in Delhi, enabling seamless travel between buses, metro, and paratransit systems to eliminate commuting barriers.
Public awareness campaigns by DMRC could also play a vital role in inspiring citizens to choose environmentally friendly transport options. Finally, the proposal emphasizes the importance of maintaining healthy indoor air quality in metro stations during high-pollution days to ensure safe transit for passengers.
The organizations emphasized that the Delhi Metro, as the lifeline of the city, is uniquely positioned to play a transformative role in addressing the air pollution crisis. Adopting these measures would not only enhance mobility but also align with Delhi's vision for a sustainable, livable urban environment."

NEW DELHI: As Delhi faces severely polluted air for a second consecutive day, BJP MP Manoj Tiwari distributed N95 masks to the public at Rajiv Chowk metro station on Tuesday. The city's air quality remained in the 'severe plus' category, prompting concerns about public health.
Tiwari, along with other BJP members, handed out masks to commuters and even helped an official wear one. The action aimed to provide immediate relief from the hazardous air, categorised by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) with an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 488 as of 8 am.
Commenting on the situation, Tiwari criticised the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for its handling of the pollution crisis, saying:
""This is like imposing Emergency. Mistakes have been made by AAP and Arvind Kejriwal's govt but the consequences are faced by the people of Delhi. I think we all need to wake up now. We are trying to create awareness of wearing masks but there needs to be a concrete solution which only BJP can give.""

Stage-IV GRAP measures enforced to combat serve pollution

The Supreme Court discussion comes as Delhi-NCR enforces Stage-IV (Severe+) measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), following an announcement by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Sunday. The measures took effect at 8am on Monday, November 18, in response to critical air quality levels and the approaching winter season, which exacerbates pollution.
Key restrictions under Stage-IV

1. Education
Delhi CM Atishi announced the suspension of physical classes for all students, except those in Classes 10 and 12, directing schools to transition to online lessons until further notice. The Delhi government had also advised shifting students in Grades VI to IX and XI to online learning. However, later, physical classes for Classes 10 and 12 were also moved to the online mode.

2. Workforce management
Authorities also urged public, municipal, and private offices to implement a 50% work-from-home policy, with the remaining workforce operating remotely.
3. Vehicle restrictions
Only trucks carrying essential goods or using clean fuel (LNG, CNG, BS-VI diesel, or electric) are permitted entry into Delhi.
Non-essential light commercial vehicles registered outside Delhi, excluding EVs and CNG or BS-VI diesel vehicles, are prohibited."

In a post on X, the Congress MP called it “unconscionable” that authorities have allowed Delhi to become the most polluted city in the world, recording air quality levels four times above the hazardous threshold. “This city is essentially uninhabitable from November to January and barely liveable the rest of the year,” he wrote, adding that despite his efforts since 2015 to bring experts and stakeholders together, “nothing seemed to change, and no one seemed to care.”

Delhi's air quality has reached alarming levels, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) recorded at 488 on Tuesday morning, placing it in the 'severe plus' category. Residents have been grappling with thick smog, drastically reduced visibility, and hazardous conditions that pose serious health risks, particularly to children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions.

Supreme Court Criticises Delay in GRAP-IV Implementation
The Supreme Court earlier on Monday, criticised the Delhi government for delays in implementing GRAP Stage IV measures, emphasising the need for strict enforcement. The court noted that restrictions must remain, even if AQI drops below 450.
Notably, 15 of Delhi's 39 monitoring stations recorded the AQI at 500. Speaking to TOI earlier, Dipankar Saham former head of the CPCB’s Air Laboratory Division had said, ""In our AQI scale, values from 451 to 500 fall in the'severe plus' category, which is considered the highest level of air emergency and corresponds to the strictest anti-pollution measures envisaged so far.""
The Supreme Court has issued important orders on physical classes and GRAP compliance, including a proposal that all NCR states consider suspending physical activities up to Class 12. The Court has also ordered the construction of monitoring teams to guarantee compliance with GRAP Stage IV actions, the establishment of a complaint mechanism for reporting violations, and the documentation of state governments' GRAP Stage IV implementation choices prior to the next hearing.

AQI likely to remain 'severe' till Nov 21
According to CPCB's bulletin, Monday's 'severe plus' Air Quality Index was surpassed only by the reading of 497 recorded on November 6, 2016, and matched the measurement from November 13, 2019.
The day was characterised by poor visibility and grey conditions across Delhi. The maximum temperature fell to the season's lowest at 23.5 degrees Celsius, four degrees below normal and 3.7 degrees lower than Sunday. The minimum temperature registered 16.2 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal.

The Air Quality Early Warning System, under the Union ministry of earth sciences, indicates that air quality will likely remain 'severe' until November 21, with AQI staying above 400. However, uncertainty remains about whether the AQI will exceed 450, reaching 'severe plus' levels.
CPCB data reveals that the AQI, measuring 441 at 4pm on Sunday, reached 'severe plus' levels by 6pm at 452. It increased to 468 by 10pm Sunday, reaching 485 by 9am Monday and 495 by 7pm. Fifteen of Delhi's 36 air monitoring stations recorded maximum AQI of 500, whilst others approached similar extreme levels.
AQI maxes out at 15 stations
On Monday, fifteen air monitoring stations across Delhi, including Ashok Vihar, Bawana, Dr Karni Singh Shooting Range, and several others, recorded maximum Air Quality Index readings.
According to Central Pollution Control Board measurements, which utilise a 0-500 scale, 33 out of 36 monitoring stations registered AQI values exceeding 490. The remaining stations also showed critically high readings, with locations like Mandir Marg recording 499.
Whilst individual stations like RK Puram had previously reached the maximum index of 500 on November 3 in past years, Monday's situation proved particularly severe. Most stations either reached 500 or showed readings of 498-499. Throughout the day, an increasing number of monitoring stations reached the maximum reading.
The monitoring station at Dwarka Sector 8 reached maximum levels at 9am on Monday, maintaining this reading throughout the day.
Delhi's various areas showed concerning PM2.5 concentrations. At Mundka, hourly PM2.5 levels reached 1,193 micrograms per cubic metre at 1pm on Monday, according to Delhi Pollution Control Committee data. This measurement exceeded the national ambient air quality standard by 20 times and surpassed WHO's daily safe guideline by 80 times.
15 Delhi-bound flights diverted
Heavy fog conditions at IGI Airport disrupted flight services on Monday. Flights headed to Delhi were rerouted, with fifteen aircraft landing at alternative airports in Jaipur and Dehradun. Flightradar24 reported that 349 flights experienced delays during the day.
The India Meteorological Department reported visibility dropping to 100 metres between 1 am and 8 am on Monday. ""A total of 15 flights were diverted between 8.30 am and 3.30 pm on Monday. Of these, 13 were diverted to Jaipur and one each to Dehradun and Lucknow due to captain minima (an operating procedure used when low visibility conditions do not meet the criteria for landing),"" stated an official at Delhi Airport.
Despite visibility improving as the day progressed, numerous flights faced delays due to the earlier disruptions. The visibility at IGI Airport reached its peak at 700 metres by 5 pm."

It also ordered that these restrictions would continue till further orders from the court, even if AQI drops below 401, the 'severe' category threshold.
The judicial crackdown came on a day when Delhi suffered a dystopian nightmare with a thick layer of pungent smoke filling the air. The day's average AQI was 494 at the highest end of 'severe-plus', the worst in eight years and the second-worst on record. The 24-hour average AQI maxed out at 500 at 15 stations at 5pm and citizens were left coughing and teary-eyed even on short exposures to the toxic fumes.
The bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih slammed the ""wait and watch"" approach of the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in enforcing Grap measures. Noting that grade III measures were enforced 48 hours after AQI level crossed 400 level, it directed that commensurate measures must be enforced immediately after the AQI level crosses the threshold and the commission should not wait for improvement in quality of air on the basis of the met department's forecast. SC administration also issued a circular in the evening advising all, including lawyers and judges to wear masks.

Pleading for closure of all classes in schools, senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan brought to court's notice that Delhi govt was allowing physical classes for classes 10 and 12, and contended that same number of school buses were running on roads to ferry them. The court, thereafter, ordered, ""States should take an immediate call to stop physical classes of all standards up to class 12.""
Meanwhile, UP govt told the SC that it had invoked Grap-4 measures from 8am onwards on Monday.


'Provide for more stringent actions under GRAP III, IV'
We direct all govts of NCR to strictly implement stage 4 of Grap. All states will immediately constitute teams for monitoring implementations of actions required under stage 4. NCR governments and the Centre will have to immediately take a call on actions provided in clauses 6 (allowing public, municipal and private offices to work on 50% strength and the rest to work from home), 7 (decision on permitting Central govt employee work from home) and 8 (closure of educational institutions, non-emergency commercial activities and plying of vehicles on odd-even basis etc) of stage 4 and place the decision taken on the record before the next date,"" the bench said.
The bench also directed CAQM to incorporate more stringent actions in stages 3 and 4 of Grap, and not leave its implementation to the discretion of the government or local authorities. SC said that CAQM's should be preemptive and it should not wait to enforce measures, after senior advocate Aprajita Singh, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, said that AQI had breached 400 in November 12 itself but Grap 3 measures were enforced after 48 hours.
""From the submissions made across the bar and from minutes of the meeting dated November 13, 2024, we find that the approach adopted by the sub-committee of the commission is contrary to what is observed in paragraph three of this court's order dated October 29, 2018. The direction was to EPCA to take preemptive steps under Grap. The approach adopted by the commission seems to be that they have decided to wait for improvement of AQI and therefore implementation of stage 3 and stage 4 was delayed. This is completely a wrong approach,"" the court said.
It also directed the states to create grievance redressal mechanisms to enable the citizens to lodge complaints of violation of actions under stage 4 and ordered them to file an affidavit on compliance of all its directions by Thursday and posted the case for further hearing on November 22."

Pollution board officials in the three cities denied any lapses on their part to rein in violations at a time GRAP IV was in force across NCR.
""In the past three days, we received only three complaints related to pollution in Noida. But when our team went to check these locations, they found no violation. The major cause of pollution across NCR is mostly meteorological. Any work that can possibly lead to pollution has been stopped. So, there is nothing from our side that is spiking up the level of pollutants in the air,"" said Utsav Sharma, regional officer of the pollution board in Noida.

As air quality deteriorated, there was a marginal drop in temperature as well in the past 24 hours. While the minimum temperature in Noida was 16.2 degrees Celsius, it was 16 degrees in Ghaziabad.
The toxic air quality prompted an emergency meeting of the environment committee headed by Noida district magistrate Manish Kumar Verma. He asked officials to ensure restrictions under GRAP IV were being properly implemented.
""A joint task force of officials from various authorities, like the pollution control board, district administration and police will be formed to monitor if guidelines of GRAP IV are being followed or not. Instructions have been issued to conduct surprise checks at construction sites and take appropriate legal action wherever necessary,"" said Verma.
In Greater Noida, Knowledge Park 3 recorded an AQI of 388, while Knowledge Park 5 logged 357, both in the ‘very poor' category.
Pollution department officials said they had recommended a fine of Rs 50 lakh on a builder project for continuing construction activity despite the ban.
""See, we can't control air coming from other cities. Our teams are inspecting construction sites late into the night. On Sunday, we found construction activities going on at a site at 1.30 in the night. The next day, we recommended a hefty fine on the developer,"" said DK Gupta, the pollution board officer in Greater Noida.
Three stations in Ghaziabad registered ‘severe' air quality. The average AQI in Loni was 475, the worst in the district, while Vasundhara logged 453, followed by Sanjay Nagar at 428. Indirapuram, on the other hand, recorded 395.

The advisory said long exposure to smog can cause wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, eye irritation and infection.
The city on Monday recorded its minimum temperature at 15.7 degrees Celsius, almost the same as the previous day. But the maximum temperature fell over three notches in 24 hours to settle at 22.9 degrees Celsius on Monday – the lowest this season.
Experts said the chamber of smog blocked out most of the sun's heat from piercing through.

""Lower temperature is leading to formation of tiny water droplets that are suspended in the air, causing fog, which is mixing with pollutants in the air. Smog is preventing sunlight from penetrating through,"" an IMD official said.
Other than Gurgaon, maximum and minimum temperatures across Haryana are in the range of 25-27 degrees Celsius, and 9-15 degrees Celsius. Winds are calm, blowing at 6-12kmph. Bhadra Choudhary, a data analyst, said he struggled to reach office on Monday morning.
""Driving on the road was like navigating a dense cloud. I could barely see a few meters ahead. It was nerve-wracking, and I was constantly struggling to catch any signs of the path and other vehicles on the road. I had to drive much slower than usual to ensure my safety,"" he said."

However, many people are using surgical masks, made ubiquitous by the Covid pandemic, because it is very affordable though they aren't effective in shielding people against respirable pollutants. Opposite AIIMS at Safdarjung Medicos, shopkeeper Javed said. ""People are opting for cheaper surgical masks. We don't recommend its use, but it is cheaper,"" the shopkeeper said. ""More awareness about masks is required."" Here, as on Aurobindo Marg, which is lined with chemist stores, the shop workers were all seen wearing
pollution masks.

But demand for the N95 mask is slowly gathering strength. ""Our supply is short,"" admitted a salesman at Chawla Chemist in Yusuf Sarai, where medical shops abound due to the area's proximity to AIIMS and Safdarjung Hospital. ""People are asking for N95 masks, but our stocks have been hit by the supplier having some problems. Some people are also bringing doctor-recommended prescriptions to fight pollution.""
At Khan Market, catering to an upscale clientele, Ishwinder, owner of Preet Medicos, said ""We have registered rising sales in masks for the last two to three days in tune with the pollution level soaring. We sell 25-30 masks every day and have ordered more N95 masks because we expect customers will want to buy them.""
In the market, not everyone had their mouth and noses protected. ""People are asking for allergy, cough and throat irritation medicines, but only the aware seem to also want to buy N95 masks,"" said Chandan at another chemist shop.
At Khanna Market, medicine sellers reported a pickup in sales of pollution masks. Mukesh Rawat, owner of MSP Pharmacy, said, ""There is definitely a demand for masks. We are selling around 30 pieces a day at Rs 50. We also expect the demand to go up."""

Under the pilot project, 14 electricity poles on the central verge have been retrofitted with 30 nozzles each to spray mist for 24 hours on the stretch.
Lieutenant governor V K Saxena, who monitored the trial run, said if the operation proves to be effective, it will be replicated in four other places in the area, and he would also advise Delhi govt to adopt it in the entire city.
""Pollution is increasing in Delhi and people are very troubled by it. DDA has done a successful experiment. In the past three-four days of testing, I was informed pollution has reduced by 20-25%. If efforts are made to gradually install such systems in the entire city, there can be a lot of difference in the pollution levels,"" he said.
A DDA official said the mist spray operation in Dwarka is Delhi's first ‘static' anti-smog drive. ""The comprehensive setup is designed to maximise pollutant reduction and enhance air quality in the area.""

Four large water tanks, each with a capacity of 5,000 litres, have been installed to support the operation. The tanks supply RO-treated water to ensure purity of the mist generated. Additionally, the system incorporates sustainable practices by utilising the wastewater from the operation for roadside plantation efforts, contributing to the area's greenery.
""To evaluate the efficacy of the anti-smog system, DDA has roped in NEERI to conduct an in-depth study. It will assess the impact of the misting technology on the ambient air quality, providing valuable data to inform future environmental strategies and expansions across Delhi.

Data from the Central Pollution Control Board, which monitors AQI on a scale of 0-500, showed that 33 of the city's 36 stations logged AQI surpassing 490 at 33 stations. Even those that did not max out came close, with Mandir Marg, for instance, recording an AQI of 499.
Some stations such as RK Puram on Nov 3 last year, had seen AQI reaching the index max of 500 in previous years. However, the situation on Monday was grave as the majority of the stations showed AQI at 500 or were at the extreme end with an AQI around 498 or 499. The number of monitoring stations recording an AQI of 500 kept increasing throughout the day.
The station at Dwarka Sector 8 hit the max at 9am on Monday and recorded the same AQI for the entire day.

Several areas in Delhi recorded alarming levels of PM2.5 concentrations. The hourly PM2.5 levels shot up to 20 times over the daily national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) of 60 micrograms per cubic metre at Mundka on Monday at 1pm with a concentration of 1,193 micrograms per cubic metre, according to data from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. It was 80 times higher than the WHO's daily safe guideline of 15 microgram per cubic metre.

Najafgarh, which recorded an AQI of 500 throughout the day, saw an hourly PM2.5 concentration of 1,117 micrograms per cubic metre at 2pm. This was 19 times higher than the national standard and 74 times higher than WHO's standard. The hourly PM2.5 levels rose to 1,083 micrograms per cubic metre at Ashok Vihar on Monday afternoon against the safe national norm of 60 and WHO's guideline of 15. Punjabi Bagh, Rohini and Nehru Nagar saw hourly PM2.5 concentrations of 1,038, 1,022 and 1,009 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively.
However, according to IQAir, which uses different parameters, AQI at Dwarka Sector 8 was 1927 at 12pm. Experts said IQAir's raw data on pollutant concentration is the same, but it uses a different formula and break-even point (the point for the shift from one pollution category to another).
Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst, Envirocatalysts, said, ""The same raw data is used by both CPCB and IQAir for calculating AQI. However, they have different formulas and break-even points, leading to differences in AQI figures. For instance, the United States categorises the 'good' category when AQI is 0-9, while CPCB defines AQI of 0-50 as 'good'."""

Many people complained of a sharp and pungent smell in the air throughout the day. It was a day when Delhiites were compelled to breathe toxic air. Many of them complained that even short-term exposure to the air caused watery eyes and headaches. The AQI on Monday was 494 on a scale of 500 at 4pm, the worst reading this season and the second highest since AQI began to be recorded in 2015.
According to the Central Pollution Control Board's bulletin, Monday's ‘severe plus' AQI was only lower than 497 logged on Nov 6, 2016, and identical to the reading of Nov 13, 2019.
As Delhiites stayed indoors or wore masks to avoid inhaling toxins, Dr Arvind Kumar, chest surgeon and founder of Lung Care Foundation and Doctors for Clean Air and Climate Action, India, warned, ""Polluted air is an invisible killer. With every breath we take, it quietly wreaks havoc on our health. From triggering asthma attacks in children to fuelling heart disease, lung cancer and cognitive decline, the impact of emissions transcends generations, leaving vulnerable communities to bear the brunt.""
Many described the day as ""gloomy"". With a grey haze hanging over the city, Delhi recorded poor visibility throughout the day. As the sun's rays were unable to penetrate the thick cover, the maximum temperature dropped to the season's lowest at 23.5 degrees Celsius, four below normal. It was also 3.7 degrees lower than Sunday's maximum. The minimum temperature stood at 16.2 degrees Celsius, four above normal.

There will be no sunshiny days for some time with the air quality likely to remain above 400 till Nov 21. The Air Quality Early Warning System, the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, has predicted that the air quality is likely to be ‘severe' till Nov 21. However, there was no clarity on whether AQI will be in the ‘severe plus' level (AQI above 450).
CPCB's data shows that AQI, which was 441 at 4pm on Sunday, entered the ‘severe plus' category at 6pm with a reading of 452. It surged to 468 at 10pm on Sunday and continued its upward trend, logging 485 at 9am on Monday and 495 at 7pm. AQI at 15 of the city's 36 air monitoring stations maxed out at 500, with the others also touching the extreme end of the scale.

Experts said a combination of factors — high local and regional pollution levels, harvest stubble fires, unfavourable meteorological conditions, including calm winds, dense fog, low temperature and inversion — caused AQI to spike. On Monday, Punjab reported 1,251 new farm fires, making it the season's highest tally in a single day. The count was 36 in Haryana, 133 in UP, 152 in Rajasthan and 639 in Madhya Pradesh. The contribution of stubble burning to Delhi's PM2.5 was 25.1% on Saturday, but data was unavailable for Sunday and Monday.
Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, ""The current situation, which is at a risk of building up to a severe air episode, is a result of a combination of elevated local and regional pollution aggravated by adverse meteorological conditions. The pollutants are trapped. We need more reliable forecasting systems to enable preventive measures. Also, durable and sustained action will require much stronger attention.""
There was dense fog in the morning. Palam recorded the lowest visibility of 100-150 metres from 11pm on Sunday to 11am on Monday before improving to 900m at 5pm. Safdarjung, the city's base weather station, logged visibility of 150m on Monday morning. The best visibility of 200m was recorded at Safdarjung at 5pm. IMD has issued an ‘orange' alert (be prepared) for dense fog for Tuesday, with ‘yellow' (be aware) for Wednesday."

Instead of addressing the crisis, BJP-led central govt is focused on political blame games, she alleged.
Hitting back, Delhi BJP chief Virendra Sachdeva said, ""On a day when Delhi expected drastic pollution relief measures, all CM did was a most irresponsible press conference on pollution to defend Punjab govt."" He added, ""She should note that the total number of 1,655 stubble burning incidents were recorded in Punjab on Nov 17 and 18 alone.""
Atishi alleged that north India was choking because of central govt's inaction. Stubble burning incidents escalated in the BJP-run states like Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, while AAP-governed Punjab registered a decline, she claimed.
Stating that the people of Delhi are in great distress and need help, CM said, ""I received phone calls throughout last night. Some needed to admit their elderly parents to hospitals due to breathing difficulties while others had to rush to get asthma inhalers for their young children late at night.""

She claimed that the official data on the reduction in stubble burning in AAP-run Punjab highlighted effective governance, unlike the approach seen in the states governed by BJP.
Delhi's air quality worsened to the ‘severe-plus' category on Monday, with the city recording an average air quality index of 484, accompanied by dense toxic smog that caused visibility to drop sharply through the day. The air quality is likely to stay ‘severe' till Nov 21.

Criticising central govt's handling of the situation, Atishi said, ""The people of Delhi are struggling to breathe, with the elderly and children requiring medical support due to the severe pollution. Instead of taking action, central govt is busy playing politics, pushing the entire region towards a health crisis.""
She questioned why central govt had not taken steps similar to those implemented in Punjab. ""If Punjab govt can reduce stubble burning, why can't BJP-run states do the same? The rising pollution levels across north India highlight the failure of central govt's policies,"" Atishi claimed.
In response, Sachdeva said the data on stubble burning clearly showed that as of now, Punjab was the biggest offender because its govt had not provided the machinery to farmers to help them alternatively clear the stubble from fields."

The minister, who held a review meeting on Monday, said: ""The health department has been directed to form a special task force to ensure the treatment of pollution-related patients."" He said the idea was to ensure pollution-related cases are handled separately.
Other restrictions put in place as part of GRAP Stage IV include a ban on light commercial vehicles registered outside Delhi from entering the capital and a ban on the plying of Delhi-registered BS IV and lower medium goods and heavy goods vehicles. Asked about the odd-even scheme, Rai said Delhi govt was taking all necessary steps at this level. ""We are monitoring the situation closely.

He also criticised the BJP-ruled Centre for failing to control pollution in north India. ""The entire north India has now fallen into the grip of severe pollution.

He pointed out that despite AAP's consistent efforts, central govt's negligence was worsening the situation.

This event will focus on fostering equity and inclusivity in sustainable mobility solutions. It aims to spotlight the challenges faced by marginalised groups, such as women, children and the elderly, while promoting their active participation in shaping urban transport systems that cater to their needs. Founding director of Climate Agenda Ekta Shekhar said the convention seeks to align with and support existing govt initiatives like the smart cities mission and FAME. By identifying unique regional challenges such as inadequate infrastructure and informal transit systems, the event aims to offer actionable solutions tailored to these states. With a focus on electrifying public transport fleets, the convention will present a roadmap to accelerate adoption and set the foundation for future collaborations, ensuring that the region contributes significantly to India's climate goals while fostering sustainable urban growth.
She said convention will be an opportunity to launch a first-of-its-kind collaborative platform aimed at knowledge-sharing, demand generation and joint action in UP, Bihar and Jharkhand.
This platform will promote the electrification of public transport, foster collaboration across sectors and support a transition to cleaner, more sustainable urban mobility solutions.

She mentioned that the convention will be attended by research scholars, academicians, policymakers, technical and subject experts, representatives from development agencies, and grassroots civil society organisations. With India on the path to becoming one of the major global economies, its energy consumption is also projected to increase exponentially. Decarbonising transportation and reversing the current trend of GHG emissions will require a transformative approach.

She further stated that India's policy and programmes for decarbonising its cities will have a significant impact on global greenhouse gas emissions. According to a 2020 report by ‘Climate action tracker: Decarbonising the Indian transport sector pathways and policies', India's transport sector is responsible for 13.5% of the country's energy-related CO2 emissions, with road transport accounting for 90% of the sector's final energy consumption.
She noted that while transport emissions have been steadily increasing in the backdrop of growing demand for internal combustion engines, policy interventions, investments and initiatives by central and state govts are playing a pivotal role in enabling and expanding green public and private mobility in urban areas. These large-scale public initiatives to decarbonise cities and transport are supported by public, private, and development sectors. Home to the world's largest population, India's action will significantly impact global emissions, especially around transport.
The Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), encompassing Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand, remains one of India's most polluted and climate-vulnerable regions. Decarbonising urban mobility here is crucial for addressing the dual crises of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions."

School Closure in NCR: The Supreme Court of India issued a landmark directive mandating the closure of schools in Delhi and across the National Capital Region (NCR) in response to the alarming levels of air pollution. With the Air Quality Index (AQI) in the ""severe"" category, the apex court ordered the implementation of stringent anti-pollution measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) Stage IV. The court's intervention underscores the urgency of the crisis, as the toxic air in the region continues to pose a significant threat to public health, especially to vulnerable groups such as children and the elderly.

Supreme Court’s Firm Stance on Air Quality Measures
In a ruling that reflects the gravity of the situation, a bench led by Justices Abhay S. Oka and Augustine George Masih directed all governments in the NCR to immediately enforce GRAP Stage IV measures, regardless of whether AQI levels drop below the critical threshold of 450. The bench expressed dissatisfaction with the delay in implementing these measures, noting that the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) had failed to act promptly. The court emphasized that the CAQM should have initiated these protocols as soon as the AQI breached the “severe” category, rather than waiting for improvement.

In its ruling, the court made it clear that the implementation of GRAP Stage IV would continue until further orders, even if AQI readings fall below 450. The court has also mandated the states and central government to submit a compliance affidavit by November 22, 2024, outlining the measures taken to curb pollution in the region.
Intensified Measures for Air Quality Control
The GRAP framework involves various stages of action, with Stage IV restrictions implemented when air quality deteriorates to hazardous levels. Under these measures, industries may be asked to reduce or halt operations, construction activities could be suspended, and restrictions could be imposed on the use of private vehicles. The court has ordered that all state governments in NCR set up monitoring teams to ensure strict compliance with these measures, and to formulate additional strategies to mitigate the pollution.

The top court also pointed out that it is the constitutional duty of the state and central governments to ensure a pollution-free environment for the citizens. This statement reflects the urgency of taking immediate action to protect the health and safety of those living in the NCR.
Delhi Schools Move to Online Classes
In Delhi, Chief Minister Atishi announced the closure of all schools for physical classes, citing the severe pollution levels and visibility issues that have dropped to just 200 meters. While students in Classes 10 and 12 preparing for board exams are allowed to attend physical classes, all other grades have transitioned to online learning indefinitely. The decision is aimed at safeguarding the health of students, who are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of toxic air.

While students in Classes 10 and 12 preparing for board exams are allowed to attend physical classes, all other grades have transitioned to online learning indefinitely. The decision is aimed at safeguarding the health of students, who are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of toxic air.
Haryana has declared holidays for primary school students up to Class 5 in both government and private schools, with local Deputy Commissioners empowered to extend holidays or shift to online classes based on AQI conditions. In Punjab, although AQI levels are in the ""unhealthy"" range, authorities are monitoring the situation closely and may consider temporary school closures. Meanwhile, in Uttar Pradesh, regions like Ghaziabad, Noida, and Meerut are facing severe AQI levels, but no official decisions on school closures or online classes have been made yet, with local discussions ongoing.

The Way Forward: Collective Responsibility to Tackle Pollution
As the situation continues to evolve, the focus will remain on both immediate relief and long-term solutions to combat pollution in Delhi and NCR. The Supreme Court’s intervention has highlighted the need for immediate and coordinated efforts by all stakeholders — from government authorities to local citizens — to address this environmental crisis. With pollution levels forecast to remain hazardous for the coming weeks, it is crucial that stringent measures be enforced and that efforts to reduce emissions are ramped up in earnest.
The ongoing school closures and the shift to online learning are just some of the precautionary measures being taken to protect public health. However, more comprehensive actions, including improvements in public transportation, industrial regulations, and green infrastructure, will be essential to bring long-term relief to the region's air quality.

It also ordered that the penalty amount for causing pollution be increased.
A bench of Justices Abhay Oka, Ahsanuddin Amanullah and Augustine George Masih said govts weren't taking effective measures to curb pollution and there was hardly any penal action by states against farmers for stubble-burning. It said that Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), instead of prosecuting officers for inaction, was only issuing showcause notices. The Centre too had failed to frame rules for penalising people for violating the Environment (Protection) Act.
""Time has come to remind the Union of India and state govts that there is a fundamental right vesting in every citizen under Article 21 of the Constitution to live in a pollution-free environment.

‘Centre, states need to coordinate on pollution’
Asking the govts not to look at the litigation on pollution problems as adversarial, the SC bench said better coordination was needed between Centre and states. It said the court was left with no option but to be harsh in passing orders on environmental matters, otherwise the situation will only worsen.
Addressing the problem of lack of mechanism to punish violators of the Environment Act, additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Centre, assured the court it will be done within two weeks and adjudicating officers will also be appointed to enforce the law.

It also pulled up Haryana and Punjab govts for their “pick and choose” policy in taking penal action against farmers and imposing fines.
“We find that selective action is being taken. In some cases, govts are claiming that they have recovered compensation and in few cases they are claiming that they have registered FIRs. The environmental compensation recovered is minimal. The manner in which action is being taken by states is reflected in the figures given across the bar. For example, this year there are 1,084 identified cases of stubble burning in Punjab. However, compensation has been recovered from only 473 persons. In Haryana, there are 419 cases identified but FIR has been lodged only against 93 wrongdoers and nominal compensation has been recovered from 328 wrong doers. Prima facie it appears to us that the penal provisions are not being consistently implemented by both the states,” the court noted in its order.
In compliance with its order, chief secretaries of both the states were present in court. Haryana claimed that 5,153 nodal officers had been appointed, leading to a significant reduction in fires, while Punjab claimed to have appointed more than 9,000 nodal officers.
CAQM in its affidavit told the court that it issued notices to various officers of both states including additional chief secretaries of agriculture and environment and member secretaries of the State Pollution Board to explain as to why action should not be initiated under Section 14 of the Commission for Air Quality Management Act which makes non-compliance of its order an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend up to five years or with fine which may extend up to one crore rupees or with both.

This situation reflects the incompetence of the AAP govt.""

South Delhi MP Ramvir Singh Bidhuri echoed similar sentiments, criticising the AAP for the public transport system in the city. ""We have consistently raised this issue inside and outside the Delhi Assembly.
The public transport system has completely collapsed, whether under Kejriwal's leadership or now under Atishi's. An improved public transport network could reduce the reliance on private vehicles, which are major contributors to air pollution,"" Bidhuri said.
The toxic smog led to a significant drop in visibility on Monday morning, prompting authorities to implement stricter pollution control measures, including a ban on truck entry and suspension of construction activities at public sites."

Amalaki (Amla) Juice
Amla, or Indian gooseberry, is rich in Vitamin C, which helps neutralise the harmful effects of pollution on the body and strengthen the body's defence system. Drinking fresh amla juice or eating one amla daily boosts immunity, supports respiratory health and protects your skin from pollution-related damage. This small addition to your routine can make a big difference in strengthening your body’s defences.

Oil Pulling Technique
Oil pulling is an ancient Ayurvedic practice that involves swishing a small amount of coconut or sesame oil in your mouth for about 5 minutes. This technique creates a protective layer around your gums and teeth, helping to strengthen the mucus linings and prevent the entry of toxins and allergens from polluted air. The oil acts as a natural barrier, preventing pollutants or toxins from entering your system and keeping your mouth clean. Incorporating Oil Pulling into your morning routine can effectively protect you from the adverse effects of smog and pollution.
Neem Water Hygiene Regime
Incorporating neem water into your daily hygiene routine can help remove pollutants from the skin and hair. Neem has powerful antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties, which help protect the skin and hair from the harsh effects of pollutants. Boil neem leaves in water, let it cool, and use it for bathing. This helps remove toxins and pollutants from your skin and hair, creating a natural protective barrier. Additionally, washing your hands with neem-infused water keeps harmful pollutants and germs at bay, adding an extra layer of protection during Delhi’s smog-filled days.
Anulom Vilom Practice
Anulom Vilom, or alternate nostril breathing, is a simple yet powerful practice that strengthens the lungs, boosts immunity, and helps cleanse the windpipe. Practising Anulom Vilom for 10-15 minutes daily can enhance lung capacity, improve respiratory health, and help your lungs filter pollutants effectively. This calming breathing exercise is an effective way to build resilience against the challenges posed by polluted air.
As pollution and smog become a daily reality, adopting these Ayurvedic remedies can help you stay protected. From soothing turmeric milk to immunity-boosting amla juice, protective herbal gargles, air-purifying ajwain fumes, and lung-strengthening yoga, these practices support your body’s ability to handle polluted air. Start these simple habits today to prepare for the winter ahead and protect your health as the pollution continues.

Here are six tips for monitoring heart health in India during smog season
Monitor Blood Pressure: Air pollution is linked to an increase in blood pressure, which places additional stress on the heart. Regular monitoring of blood pressure is essential during smog season, particularly for individuals with a history of hypertension or heart disease. Home blood pressure monitors are widely available and convenient to use. It is advisable to check blood pressure at the same time each day for consistency. If significant spikes or trends toward high blood pressure occur during periods of poor air quality, consulting a healthcare provider may be necessary to adjust treatment plans or take preventive steps.

Stay Hydrated: Dehydration exacerbates the impact of air pollution on the cardiovascular system. When the body is dehydrated, the blood thickens, which makes it more difficult for the heart to pump efficiently. This increases the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks or strokes. Staying hydrated is essential, especially during hot, polluted days when smog levels are high. Recognising signs of dehydration, such as dark urine, dizziness, or dry mouth, can help in maintaining proper hydration, reducing the strain on the heart.
Monitor Symptoms of Heart Stress: During smog season, it is essential to pay close attention to any symptoms that might indicate that one’s heart is under stress. Shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, and palpitations are all warning signs of cardiovascular issues. If one notices any of these symptoms, especially during high-smog days, it is best to seek medical attention immediately. These symptoms could be early indicators of conditions such as angina, arrhythmia, or even a heart attack. Early intervention can make all the difference in preventing serious complications.Document symptoms such as chest discomfort, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, and unusual fatigue. Also, noting environmental factors such as Air Quality Index (AQI) levels and daily activities can help correlate symptoms with pollution exposure.
Schedule Regular Health Checks and Cardiac Screening: An electrocardiogram (ECG) provides a more comprehensive picture of the heart's electrical activity, making it useful for detecting irregular heart rhythms and other cardiovascular issues. Although daily ECG monitoring is not necessary for most individuals, scheduling regular ECG tests, particularly during or after smog season, can help identify any early signs of heart stress. Some wearable devices now offer ECG functionality, allowing for convenient home monitoring. However, professional evaluation remains critical if symptoms such as chest pain, fatigue, or irregular heartbeats occur.
Stop Ignoring The AQI Index: Long Exposure To Polluted Air Can Increase Your Risk Of Heart Attack

Maintain a Healthy Diet: Eating a heart-healthy diet can help mitigate the effects of air pollution. Foods rich in antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids, and fibre, such as fruits, vegetables, fish, and whole grains help. These foods help reduce inflammation and protect your heart. Consider adding more anti-inflammatory foods like berries, leafy greens, and nuts to your daily meals.
Track Local Air Quality: Keeping an eye on air quality levels is one of the most effective ways to reduce exposure to harmful pollutants. Air quality can be monitored through various apps and online tools such as AirVisual or AQICN, which provide real-time updates on pollution levels. The AQI offers an easy-to-understand rating system that categorises pollution from ""good"" to ""hazardous."" When the AQI reaches unhealthy levels—typically at 100 or above, depending on the region—limiting outdoor activities can help minimise the cardiovascular strain caused by inhaling fine particles and gases.
Smog season presents unique challenges for maintaining cardiovascular health, particularly due to the inflammatory and oxidative effects of air pollutants on the heart and vascular system. Preventive care strategies, including regular check-ups with healthcare providers, adherence to prescribed medications, and lifestyle modifications—such as a heart-healthy diet and exercise—play a pivotal role in mitigating the risks associated with poor air quality. By taking proactive steps to monitor and protect cardiovascular health, individuals can significantly reduce the risk of serious complications associated with smog exposure, ultimately fostering a healthier heart and improving overall well-being.

""The report by the Health Effects Institute said in 2021 that almost 8 million people in the world died because of air pollution. This is more than the number of people who have died due to Covid-19. We are concerned about Covid, but we are not concerned about air pollution."" Guleria said.
""We were very concerned about Covid, but we are not that concerned that we should be air pollution,"" he added.
Dr. Guleria added that recent data from India indicates a mere 10 microgram per cubic meter increase in Particulate Matter 2.5, a tiny air pollutant with particles 2.5 micrometers or smaller, is linked to higher mortality rates.
""This occurs because of respiratory and cardiac problems. Air pollution causes more inflammation in the lungs. The respiratory problem worsens. They land up in the ICU or a ventilator at times, and this leads to higher mortality,"" he said.

Dr Guleria states that air pollution can lead to inflammation or swelling of the heart's vessels in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions. This inflammation increases the risk of heart attacks in these patients. Furthermore, he emphasizes that the effects of air pollution are not limited to the heart and lungs but can also impact other organs in the body.
""In people who have heart disease...it causes inflammation or swelling of the vessels of the heart and this also leads to higher chances of heart attack. It's not with the heart and the lungs, but pollution can affect almost any part of the body because these fine particles of air pollutants, less than 2.5 microns and other chemicals, when they enter the body from the lungs, can go into various organs, so they can lead to diseases that have a long-term effect, like dementia, neurological problems, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome; all of these have been linked to air pollution,"" Dr Guleria added.
""As per the dynamic model and forecasts for weather/meteorological conditions and air quality provided by IMD/IITM, there is a likelihood of the daily average AQI of Delhi remaining in the 'very poor' category (AQI 301-400) in the coming days due to unfavourable meteorological and climatic conditions,"" according to a Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change release.
The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has activated the second stage of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi due to the deteriorating air quality. The decision was taken by the sub-committee of the CAQM to prevent further worsening of the situation.
As a result of the implementation of Stage II of GRAP, an 11-point action plan is now in effect across the National Capital Region (NCR). The plan includes measures such as mechanical/vacuum sweeping and water sprinkling on identified roads, intensified inspections at construction and demolition sites, and proper disposal of collected dust at designated sites.
The CAQM has urged people to use public transport, minimise the use of personal vehicles, and regularly replace air filters in their vehicles. People are also advised to avoid dust-generating activities and open burning of solid waste and biomass. The AQI of Delhi on Tuesday hovered around 300 throughout the day, as per CAQM data.

We are urging candidates contesting in the assembly polls to look into the problem and shift the plant, if they want our votes,"" said Anirodha Mishra, a member of the residents' forum.

The protesters also blamed PMC and PCB for ignoring the problem.
""All the development in the area happened based on plans approved by these civic bodies. It's then time they corrected these errors. This is a matter of grave concern,"" Mishra said.
The Hadapsar garbage plant is one of the biggest such units in Pune city. In 2021, officials said that nearly 200-250 tonnes of waste, from all over the city, was being brought to the site for processing.
For years, residents have been demanding the plant be moved away from populated areas. Three years ago, PMC officials said the smell was not from their plant, but from the nearby PCB wet-waste unit. At the time, they had promised to look into the matter and resolve it."

With the AQI deteriorating with each passing day, some residents said they were planning long vacations in the hills to escape the toxic air.
""I've decided to shift from Noida to a hilly village for the next few months. Unfortunately, I've been suffering from a severe throat infection for some time now. The authorities here have failed to come up with an effective plan to control pollution. So, people like us have little option but to escape to areas where we can breathe fresh air in this region,"" said Pushkar Raj Chandra of Sector 62, Noida.

Tushar Kumar, an IT professional, is planning a trip to Nainital. ""I don't want my baby to inhale such toxic air. It's very difficult for even us to breathe. We are plan to go to Nainital and stay there until the situation improves here,"" he told TOI.
A Greater Noida resident said increasing pollution had had an effect on her asthma over the years. Pets, too, are bearing the brunt of toxic air.
""Pets also suffer from respiratory infections. Three of my rescue dogs developed lung ailments in the past couple of years. I lost one of them this year. Animals that breathe in polluted air are more vulnerable to infections. Just like us humans, they, too, have allergies and skin issues,"" said Kaveri Rana, who runs an animal rescue centre in Greater Noida.
Sector 62, Noida's office and industry hub, was the most polluted in the city, registering a ‘very poor' AQI of 384. Sector 1, which covers several industrial and residential sectors, registered 290. In Sector 116, the average AQI was ‘poor', at 290. The Sector 125 station, which covers commercial and institutional areas near the Yamuna across Faridabad, saw an average AQI of 298."

At 1,080 this season, Haryana has registered fewer farm fires between Sept 15 and Nov 16 compared to the corresponding period since 2020. In 2023, Haryana saw 1,986 farm fires, 3,233 in 2022, 5,993 in 2021, and 3,701 in 2020. Similarly, in Punjab, there were 8,000 fires during the same period this year, down from 31,932 in 2023, 46,822 in 2022, 68,922 in 2021, and 80,098 in 2020.
Palak Balyan of Climate Trends agreed that the reduction in incidents of stubble burning did not have the desired effect on NCR's air.

""Stubble burning is not the only source of air pollution, especially during winter. If we analyse data in the first 11 days of Nov, we can clearly see that farm fires haven't impacted air quality to that extent. In winter, meteorological conditions and local factors such as road dust, construction activities, heavy vehicles, and waste burning are responsible for polluting the air in the region,"" said Balyan.
Researchers, however, expressed doubt if the data indeed portrayed the correct picture of fire count in Punjab. They said the number of stubble burning cases was based on images from two satellites that passed the region around 10.30am and 1.30pm daily. These satellites may have missed out on many fires later in the afternoon or earlier in the day.
Hiren Jethva, a senior research scientist at Nasa Goddard Space Flight Centre and affiliated with Morgan State University, posted on X that while farm fires had come down over the past few years, aerosol loading, or pollutants, in the atmosphere had increased or remained near stable compared to previous years.
""It is true that fires in Haryana are at their best levels. However, stubble burning in Indian Punjab and the Pakistan side have contributed immensely to degrading the regional air quality,"" he told TOI.
Piyush Bharadwaj, an air quality scientist at the Centre for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP), agreed.
""The satellite-based fire detection algorithm has challenges in spotting night-time fires, small fires, and those occurring on cloudy days or at other times,"" he said. ""To check if fires occurred after satellite overpass time, we could also use other satellite data products, such as aerosol optical depth and burnt area, which can still show signs of fire activities during non-overpass times,"" he added.
""The frequency of stubble burning is low around the time window when Nasa and NOAA satellites pass the region. However, the Korean Geo station satellite data shows that the frequency of fires has shifted to late afternoon,"" said Jethva."

According to the data of the Central Control Room for Air Quality Management, gaseous pollutants such as sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were traced in Lucknow's air, along with harmful PM 10 and PM 2.5 pollutants. The average concentration of SO2 and NO2 in the city was recorded at 29.92 and 6.54 micrograms per cubic metre of air. Lalbagh had the highest NO2 concentration in the city at 29.92, while SO2 concentration stood at 6.54.

NO2 and SO2 concentrations were 5.66 and 14.12 in localities surrounding the Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University (BBAU), 6.73 and 8.39 in Gomtinagar, 2.13 and 6.99 in Aliganj, and 15.35 and 22.42 micrograms per cubic metre of air in Kukrail.
The stagnant weather conditions, in combination with the withdrawal of the monsoon, favour the instant formation of particles, leading to the cumulative accumulation of aerosols, which subsequently causes an air quality crisis. Cooler nights and relatively warm days result in the formation of warm air that traps pollutants near the surface, creating inversion conditions and limiting their dispersal, causing a build-up of gaseous pollutants emitted from vehicular exhaust, particularly in urban centres.
""Gaseous pollutants like SO2 and NO2 are emitted into the air from the combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, diesel, fuel oil, gasoline, and natural gas. Traffic snarls and people preferring personal vehicles over public transport increase vehicular load and elevate emissions of NO2 and hydrocarbons,"" said Prof Narendra Kumar of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University.
He said with deciduous trees shedding leaves, the air's natural purification decreases. A combination of regulatory measures, public awareness, and technological advancements in urban areas can mitigate air pollution effectively, especially during the fall."

Delhi's daily average Air Quality Index (AQI) rose sharply to 441 by 4 PM on Sunday, and further escalated to 457 by 7 PM, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).
This severe spike prompted an emergency meeting of the GRAP Sub-Committee.
""Keeping in view the prevailing trend of deteriorating air quality of NCR, and in an effort to prevent further deterioration of air quality in the region, the Sub-Committee today has taken the call to invoke all actions as envisaged under Stage-IV of GRAP - 'Severe+' Air Quality (Delhi's AQI > 450), w.e.f. 08:00 AM of 18.11.2024 (tomorrow) in the entire NCR,"" the CAQM said in a statement.

This is in addition to the preventive/ restrictive actions mentioned under Stage I, Stage II and Stage III of GRAP already in force.
The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) for the National Capital Region (NCR) is classified under four different stages of adverse air quality in Delhi: Stage I -- 'poor' (AQI 201-300); Stage II -- 'very poor' (AQI 301-400); Stage III -- 'severe' (AQI 401-450); and Stage IV -- 'severe plus' (AQI >450).
The Stage-IV response encompasses an 8-point action plan designed to mitigate the pollution crisis. Key measures include banning the entry of non-essential truck traffic into Delhi, except for trucks carrying essential commodities or providing essential services.
LNG/CNG/electric and BS-VI diesel trucks will still be permitted. Light commercial vehicles (LCVs) registered outside Delhi will also be restricted from entering, except those powered by electric, CNG, or BS-VI diesel engines. Delhi-registered BS-IV and below diesel-operated medium and heavy goods vehicles will be prohibited from operating, except for those carrying essential services.
The Sub-Committee has also extended the ban on construction and demolition activities to include public infrastructure projects like highways, roads, flyovers, and power transmission lines.
State governments and the Government of Delhi (GNCTD) have been advised to consider shifting physical classes for students in grades VI-IX and XI to online mode and to limit office attendance to 50%, with the rest working from home. A similar work-from-home arrangement may be considered for central government employees.
Additionally, state governments have been urged to consider emergency measures such as closing colleges and non-essential commercial activities and implementing an odd-even vehicle policy to reduce pollution. The CAQM has called on citizens to cooperate with these measures and stay indoors as much as possible, especially vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, and those with respiratory or cardiovascular conditions.
The CAQM emphasized that it is closely monitoring the air quality and will review the situation regularly to assess further action."

Patna: Patna and the neighbouring cities continued to battle with rising air pollution as a dense layer of smog blanketed parts of the state capital on Sunday morning. The overall air quality index (AQI) in the city was recorded at 305 on Sunday, which is categorised as ""very poor"" and can affect respiratory health on prolonged exposure, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data.
Air pollution is likely to slip into the upper end of the ""very poor"" category in the next 24 hours with no improvement in sight for the next couple of days due to unfavourable weather conditions like calm wind and a fall in temperature as per the air quality forecast model of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD).
Of the six monitoring stations located across the city, the one at Samanpura recorded the worst AQI at 405, which falls in the ‘severe' zone and affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases, according to the CPCB. Three stations – Rajbanshi Nagar, Planetarium and DRM office-Khagaul – were in the ""very poor"" zone and recorded their pollution index at 351, 342 and 333 respectively. Patna City's AQI stood at 209 in the ‘poor' zone and 190 at Muradpur, which falls in the ‘moderate' category.
Apart from Patna, residents of Hajipur also breathed toxic air as the 24-hour AQI, recorded at 4pm every day, stood at 367 on Saturday, up from 329 the previous day. The cities in Bihar, which recorded the pollution level in the ‘poor' zone, included Bhagalpur (267), Kishanganj (261), Begusarai (261), Rajgir (252), Buxar (251), Chhapra (232), Samastipur (231), Biharsharif (226), Munger (220) and Muzaffarpur (206).

According to the CPCB, an AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good', 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory', 101 and 200 ‘moderate', 201 and 300 ‘poor', 301 and 400 ‘very poor', and 401 and 500 ‘severe'.
Experts predict that air pollution levels will continue to rise in the coming days due to falling temperatures, wind speed and thermal inversion. They recommend the immediate implementation of pollution control measures, such as water sprinkling and covered construction, among others, to mitigate the impact of increasing air pollution.

Patna Municipal Corporation commissioner Animesh Kumar Parashar said to make the city clean and reduce air pollution, the civic body is cleaning and washing various public places through sweeping machines, anti-smog and water sprinklers. ""Every day in two shifts, anti-smog teams are spraying on Ashok Rajpath, Boring Road, Bailey Road, Bari Path, Polo Road, Atal Path, Dak Bungalow crossing, Mithapur, Kankarbagh and other roads,"" he said.
""We have 19 sweeping machines, 12 water sprinklers and 14 anti-smog guns. The water sprinkler machine is designed in such a way that it rotates 180 degrees and sprays water to reduce air pollution from the atmosphere. Anti-smog guns help in normalising the dust flying in the atmosphere through the roads,"" Parashar said."

The crisis has particularly affected Pakistan's Punjab province, where smog and hazardous air quality levels have created a public health emergency.
Hospitals across Punjab have been overwhelmed, with Lahore recording the highest number of cases. Toxic smog forced over 75,000 people to seek medical help on a single day, further straining the healthcare system. Over the past month, Lahore alone reported 133,429 respiratory disease cases, including 5,577 asthma patients. Additionally, 5,455 of the 13,862 heart disease cases and 491 of the 5,141 stroke cases in the province were treated in Lahore. The crisis escalated in the past week, with 449,045 respiratory cases reported, along with 30,146 asthma cases, 2,225 heart disease patients, and 1,400 stroke victims.
The government has taken several emergency measures, including closing schools, colleges, and parks, limiting market hours, and imposing bans on polluting vehicles and industrial activities. Despite these steps, air quality in cities like Lahore and Multan continues to deteriorate. Lahore’s Air Quality Index (AQI) consistently exceeds hazardous levels, often surpassing 1,000, while Multan recently recorded an alarming AQI of over 2,000.
Residents are struggling to cope with the smog’s health impacts. For many, staying indoors offers little relief, and air purifiers remain unaffordable luxuries. Public and private schools have been ordered to close until November 24, with authorities also enforcing a three-day lockdown in Lahore and Multan to mitigate pollution. However, these measures have brought limited respite.

Healthcare workers are stretched to their limits. Doctors report a significant increase in patients, particularly children and the elderly, suffering from breathing difficulties, coughing fits, and eye irritation. “This year, smog levels are much worse, and the number of affected patients is far greater,” said Dr Qurat ul Ain, a medical practitioner in Lahore. She advises residents to wear masks and avoid outdoor exposure.
The smog’s primary causes include industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, and seasonal agricultural stubble burning, exacerbated by stagnant weather conditions. Climate activist Alia Haider described the city as “stuck in its own poison” and criticised the lack of effective long-term solutions. As smog continues to blanket Pakistan’s major cities, millions remain at risk, awaiting meaningful action to address the worsening environmental crisis."

Dr Sundeep Salvi, director of Pulmocare Research and Education Foundation in Pune, said he was seeing a shift in respiratory infection patterns. ""This year is different because after Diwali, viral infections are lingering for a longer period than earlier. Infections are now persisting for more than a week as against 2-3 days before,"" he said.
He said pollution was known to worsen underlying viral infections, something previously demonstrated in laboratory studies. ""Now, we're observing this in real life,"" Dr Salvi said.
Medical experts said even moderate air quality levels posed significant health risks. ""The damage created by poor air quality remains for an extended period. The healing process takes longer, even when pollution levels are only moderately high,"" he said.

Some doctors are even reporting pollution-triggered hospital admissions for respiratory conditions, particularly among those suffering from asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
Pulmonologist Dr Himanshu Pophale said there was a surge in patients experiencing exacerbation of their COPD and asthma symptoms. ""The situation is further complicated by people continuing to burst firecrackers even after Diwali...In the post-monsoon season, owing to temperature drop, pollutants tend to stay near the surface level and don't disperse properly, leading to increased exposure to these harmful elements.""

Detailing the severity of cases, Dr Pophale said, ""We are seeing pollution-triggered hospitalizations among COPD and asthma patients. The excessive symptoms are necessitating hospital care, with some even developing pneumonia.""
Another pulmonologist, Dr Swapnil Gosavi, said, ""Cases of lower and upper respiratory tract infections are increasing by the day, with COPD and asthmatic patients landing in hospital complaining of breathlessness because of the air pollution. H1N1 cases too have flared up over the last 10 days.""
Safar (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research) data from Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) showed persistent elevation in air pollutants. PM2.5 levels (running mean) reached 62.99 micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m3) at 5am on Nov 16, exceeding the permissible limit of 60 μg/m3. Previous readings showed PM2.5 at 64 μg/m3 on Nov 15 (1am) and 82 μg/m3 on Nov 12 (2pm).
PM10 levels have shown even higher violations of standards. Against the permissible limit of 100 μg/m3, PM10 running mean was recorded at 128 μg/m3 on Nov 16 (11am). Earlier readings were more severe, with hourly observations showing 168 μg/m3 on Nov 13 (11am), while the running mean on Nov 12 was 148 μg/m3.
Running mean represents an average calculated over a specified time period, typically 24 hours, providing a more stable indication of air quality trends compared to hourly readings. It helps smooth out short-term fluctuations to show sustained pollution levels.
These consistently elevated readings indicated that both PM2.5 and PM10 levels had been persistently exceeding their respective maximum permissible limits, beyond which they are considered harmful to human health."

The Commission has also urged people to shift to public transport, cycle for small distances.
According to the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) bulletin on Saturday, wind from the northwest direction in Delhi-NCR with 10-16 kmph wind speed is likely to reduce, leaving the city in smog and dense fog, further increasing visibility woes for the people on Sunday.

IITM said that mixing height is expected to reach 2500 on Sunday, adding that a ventilation index lower than 6000 m with an average wind speed of less than 10 kmph is unfavorable for the dispersion of pollutants.

Rai criticised BJP govts of neighbouring states, alleging that they were deliberately sending the diesel buses to increase pollution in Delhi. The minister claimed that the diesel buses arriving in Delhi from Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh were leading to increased pollution.
Rai further stated that 84 teams from the transport department and 280 teams from the traffic police had been deployed to enforce the ban.

""BS-III and below diesel light commercial vehicles registered outside Delhi will not be permitted to enter the city. However, vehicles carrying essential goods and providing essential services are exempted. Only electric buses, CNG buses and BS-VI diesel buses from NCR will be allowed to enter interstate terminals.

Delhi BJP alleged that AAP-led govt was making empty remarks instead of focusing on concrete pollution control measures. ""It is shameful that Rai neither discusses stubble burning with Punjab govt nor addresses road repair issues with his govt's PWD and municipal corporation. Yet, he finds ample time to visit bus depots and engage in political theatrics by stopping a couple of interstate diesel buses,"" said Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva.
Sachdeva asked govt if it had made any arrangement to prevent the entry of diesel vehicles into Delhi. ""If nothing else, Delhi govt could have at least installed prohibition boards for diesel vehicles at borders,"" he added.
The Delhi BJP president said that the two major causes of pollution in Delhi were stubble burning and dust & debris from broken roads. ""Daily media reports and departmental data show that 30% of Delhi's rising pollution is caused by smoke from Punjab's stubble burning,"" he added.

Alok Singh, a resident of Vaishali's Sector 4, said every morning the city wakes up to a thick smog blanket. ""Crackers are making matters worse. I thought the smog and pollution data would instil some sense, but people have continued to burn crackers during the wedding season too. There is a burning sensation in my throat every morning when I step out for a walk,"" he said.
When asked, UPPCB regional officer Vikas Misra said GRAP 3 guidelines do not specify the role of the pollution board in implementing the firecracker ban. ""Neither does UPPCB have any power to penalise the violators, nor do we have any manpower to do it. This is to be done by the police,"" he said.
Police too, tried to pass the buck. ""We have not received any complaints regarding firecrackers in the last two days. Still, we will carry out checks at banquet halls and localities to ensure violators are penalised. We urge the public to adhere to GRAP 3 norms and avoid crackers,"" police commissioner Ajay Mishra told TOI.
The district administration, meanwhile, is yet to issue an advisory to banquet halls against the bursting of firecrackers during wedding events, officials said.
Environmentalist Akash Vashishtha, who has been tracking the issue for years, flagged how inadequate enforcement of existing rules was one of the weakest links in the fight against air pollution. Firecrackers, he said, add to particulate matter — fine inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometres and smaller — that are the greatest health risk.
""Authorities need to adopt a zero-tolerance approach. It is the duty of statutory bodies to ensure GRAP regulations are not violated. UPPCB is under obligation to ask the administration to issue directives to the police to crack down on firecrackers. Even otherwise, the administration and police are under obligation to enforce GRAP rules. It doesn't need specific complaints to act on it,"" Vashishtha said."

The majority of farmers either dump the remains by the roadside or burn them, which significantly contributes to air pollution.
Farmers have the option to convert husk into manure, but a lack of awareness, slow processes, and time constraints result in a waste of wealth. Krishnamurthy of Narasimharaja Pura taluk said he produces a large quantity of husk but has no proper idea of how to convert it into manure. ""I tried turning it into manure, but it takes a lot of time and energy. We need a large area to dump it, and thus it is inevitable to dump it,"" he said.
A farmer, Sadananda, said he heard of converting husk into manure but has no proper ideas. The authorities must educate farmers in this regard, he urged.
From a one-acre betel nut plantation, approximately 600-700 kilograms of dry husks are obtained. Betel nut is cultivated over about 12.75 lakh acres in Karnataka, producing around 8.9 lakh tonnes of husk annually. Most of the husk is wasted without any use.

MY Ullasa, assistant prof of Agronomy, Keladi Shivappa Nayaka University of Agricultural and Horticultural Sciences, Shivamogga, said the waste betel nut husks are often discarded along the roadside. ""Although it seems like a common practice to either discard or burn the husks after extracting the betel nuts, this causes significant harm,"" he said.
""Betel nut husk is an organic material rich in nutrients essential for betel nut cultivation. Instead of wasting such organic matter, if it is composted and added to the soil, it increases the organic content, enhances the soil's water retention and nutrient holding capacity, and boosts microbial activity, making nutrients more accessible to plants. If this beneficial organic material is burned or discarded, not only are nutrients lost, but the environment is also polluted,"" he said.

This transportation curb could impact school commutes, as many students rely on school buses or chartered buses to travel to and from school. With the restriction on BS-regulated vehicles, these transportation options may be limited in Delhi and adjacent areas.
Understanding GRAP Stages and Triggers
The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) operates in stages depending on AQI levels:
GRAP-1: Activated at an AQI range of 201-300, initiating basic measures like public advisories, dust control, and open burning restrictions.

GRAP-2: Triggered when AQI reaches 301-400, involving restrictions on diesel generator use, increased mechanized cleaning, and water sprinkling on roads.
GRAP-3: Imposed once AQI crosses 400, with stricter controls, including bans on non-essential construction, limits on heavy vehicle entry, and the halting of activities in polluting industries.
GRAP-4: The most severe level, enacted when AQI exceeds 450, involves a complete halt on construction, mandatory school closures, and severe vehicle restrictions, including potential odd-even schemes for private vehicles.
Precautions for Students Amid Poor Air Quality
In light of deteriorating air quality, students are encouraged to take several precautionary measures:
Wearing Masks: It is recommended that students wear protective masks, particularly N95 masks, when outside to protect against harmful air pollutants. This precaution is especially important for students with respiratory conditions or heightened sensitivity to pollution.
Using Air Purifiers: Families should consider using air purifiers at home to maintain better indoor air quality, which is particularly beneficial for children with asthma or other respiratory issues.
Staying Updated: Students should regularly check AQI updates and follow any guidelines issued by schools and health authorities. Discussing environmental issues at home can also help students develop awareness and a sense of responsibility toward managing air pollution impacts.

The hidden crisis in our homes and cities,"Oct 9, 2024, 21:00 IST","Air pollution is a major risk factor for various lung-related illnesses. Since the lungs are constantly exposed to the air we breathe, the quality of that air is critical to overall lung health. The impact of poor air quality affects all age groups, but it is especially severe for women, children, and the elderly. Those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are disproportionately affected, as they are more likely to be exposed to both indoor and outdoor air pollution.

Indoor air pollution
Indoor air pollution is particularly harmful in rural and low-income households. Many families still rely on traditional cooking methods like chulhas, using biomass fuels such as wood, animal dung, or crop waste. This increases the concentration of harmful pollutants in the home, putting women and children at particular risk. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that nearly one-third of the global population still cooks with open fires, which contributed to 3.2 million deaths in 2020. Exposure to these pollutants is linked to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), worsening asthma, and even lung cancer.

Other common indoor pollutants include household dust, pet dander, mold, and pest allergens. These irritants can exacerbate conditions like asthma and increase the risk of respiratory infections. Tobacco smoke, another major source of indoor pollution, impacts both smokers and non-smokers through second-hand and third-hand exposure. Even when smoking stops, harmful particles linger on surfaces, posing a continuous risk.

Outdoor air pollution
Outdoor air pollution stems from vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and the burning of fossil fuels. Common outdoor pollutants include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. These pollutants can severely impact lung health.
Studies conducted on auto-rickshaw drivers and other individuals frequently exposed to outdoor pollution have shown higher incidences of respiratory issues such as chronic cough, breathlessness, and asthma. The prolonged inhalation of these pollutants increases the risk of developing chronic bronchitis and lung cancer. WHO estimates that air pollution accounts for 29% of lung cancer deaths and 43% of COPD deaths.
Children are especially vulnerable to the harmful effects of pollution. Studies show that children living in highly polluted areas are more prone to recurrent respiratory infections and even premature death due to respiratory complications.
Mitigating air pollution’s impact
To reduce the harmful effects of air pollution on lung health, several strategies can be employed. One important step is switching to cleaner cooking methods, such as using LPG instead of biomass fuels, which has been shown to significantly lower indoor pollution. Improved ventilation and reducing products that emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can also improve indoor air quality.
Minimizing exposure to outdoor air pollution is equally important. Reducing outdoor activities during peak pollution hours, using air purifiers indoors, and wearing respiratory masks in polluted areas can help protect lung health. Additionally, governments and industries need to take proactive measures to limit emissions and promote cleaner technologies.
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is essential to combating the effects of pollution. Regular exercise, a balanced diet rich in antioxidants, and avoiding smoking can help protect and strengthen the respiratory system.
Khaasi aur Qawwali: When Delhi's pollution inspires musical talents

In conclusion, both indoor and outdoor air quality have a significant impact on lung health. Taking individual and collective measures to improve air quality can greatly reduce the burden of respiratory illnesses caused by pollution, improving the quality of life for millions worldwide.

This year, a combination of seasonal pollution factors, stubble burning, and traffic emissions have compounded the crisis, pushing authorities to intensify measures.

Delhi recorded its highest AQI of the season on January 14, with a reading of 447. The day also saw the city's first very dense fog, reducing visibility to zero at Palam between 8 am and 9.30 am. At Safdarjung, the capital's base station, visibility dropped to 200 meters at 7am.

With low visibility persisting throughout the day and little sunlight, the maximum temperature plummeted to a season's low of 27.8°C, five degrees lower than the previous day. The minimum temperature was recorded at 17°C, three degrees above normal.
While GRAP-2 measures were initially imposed to limit particulate matter, the worsening conditions have led to an upgrade to GRAP-3, which entails stricter restrictions to prevent the city’s air from slipping further into hazardous levels.
When GRAP-1, 2, 3, and 4 are triggered?

GRAP-1: Initiated when AQI ranges between 201-300, with basic measures such as public advisories, dust control, and restriction on open burning.
GRAP-2: Enforced when AQI reaches 301-400, involving restrictions on diesel generator sets, intensifying mechanized cleaning, and sprinkling water on roads.
GRAP-3: Imposed when AQI crosses 400, adding stringent curbs like a ban on non-essential construction activities, restricting entry of heavy vehicles into the city, and halting brick kilns and stone crushers.
GRAP-4: The final stage, activated when AQI exceeds 450, involves a complete halt on all construction, closure of schools, and severe vehicle restrictions, up to odd-even schemes for private vehicles.
Key Restrictions Under GRAP-3 in Delhi NCR
The implementation of Stage 3 under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) introduces targeted restrictions to curb air pollution, particularly from construction and vehicle emissions.

Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)
The Snake Plant is perfect for bedrooms since it can create oxygen even at night. It filters from the air dangerous contaminants including formaldehyde, toluene, and xylene. Vastu Shastra sees this plant as a monument of fortitude and will. Placed east or north, it blocks negative energy and draws wealth. Its prominent, straight leaves make it a pleasing addition to contemporary homes even as they quietly help to enhance air quality.

Money Plant (Epipremnum aureum)
In Vastu Shastra, the Money Plant is typically connected with riches and success. Excellent for enhancing indoor air quality, this tough plant efficiently absorbs dangerous chemicals including carbon monoxide and benzene. Placing the Money Plant in the South-East direction, under Venus, guarantees financial growth and tranquility in relationships, claims Vastu. Steer clear of maintaining it in the North-East corner; this could cause financial unrest. Its flowing vines provide your house a tasteful and joyful atmosphere.
Aloe Vera (Aloe barbadensis miller)
Versatile in nature, aloe Vera is well-known for its therapeutic qualities and ability to absorb formaldehyde and benzene therefore purifying the air. Additionally, it releases oxygen at night, which makes it ideal for your bedroom for improved fresh air and sleep. Aloe Vera is regarded in Vastu as a therapeutic plant promoting calm and quiet. Either east or north placement improves mental clarity and spiritual well-being. Aloe Vera is a useful and sensible plant for every house with low maintenance needs.
Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum)
Respected for its air-purifying and therapeutic qualities, tulsi, sometimes known as Holy Basil, has a special spot in Indian homes. It is a great natural cleaner since it absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen even at night. Vastu claims that Tulsi is supposed to draw spiritual energy and fight negative influence. Tulsi ideally fits in the North, East, or North-East direction since it promotes family peace and helps to boost spiritual development there. Its scented leaves freshen your house as well.
Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum)
The Peace Lily is a beautiful plant with strong air purifying properties as well. It filters the air of poisons including formaldehyde, benzene, and ammonia. Vastu Shastra ties the tranquility Lily to harmony, tranquility, and good fortune. Positioned in the North-East corner, it enhances the space's vitality and encourages mental tranquilly. Its elegant white blossoms represent purity and optimism, hence they would be ideal for accentuating the visual and dynamic character of your house.
Maximizing their Advantages
Placing plants in the orientations advised by Vastu will help to maximize their benefits. Keep prickly plants like cactus outside; they draw bad energy and should not be kept indoors.
Regular watering and leaf cleaning help to guarantee their best growth and operation.
Thoughtful placement of these plants will help you to balance their natural beauty with their energy impact.
Including these six indoor plants into your house can help you to embrace the ageless knowledge of Vastu Shastra and create a better, more harmonic living environment.

CAQM said Grap 3 was being invoked from 8am Friday ""in an effort to prevent further deterioration"" in air quality. Last year, Grap 3 had kicked in on Nov 2.

The air quality early warning system by IITM expects the AQI to improve to 'very poor' on Friday, even though its forecast also says that weather conditions are likely to be unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants.
Out Of Breath, Delhi To Slow Down For Curbs

According to the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology’s Decision Support System (DSS), the share of stubble burning in the city's air quality was 30% on Wednesday against 17% on Tuesday.
“The air quality is likely to be in the very poor category from Nov 15 to 17. In the subsequent six days, air quality is likely to remain in the very poor category,” IITM’s air quality early warning system update said.
Restrictions under stageIII of Grap include a ban on C&D activities, banning of BS-4 diesel buses from NCR states, and restriction of BS-3 petrol and BS-4 diesel cars, among others, with certain exceptions for essential services.
The CAQM stated that it noted an episodic hike in AQI on Wednesday due to “highly adverse meteorological and climate conditions”. “However, it remained stagnant since morning today and was hovering around the 425 mark, due to continued heavy fog and unfavourable meteorological conditions over the Indo-Gangetic Plain, including Punjab, Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Forecasts from IMD/IITM also indicate the likelihood of the AQI of Delhi remaining in the higher end of ‘very poor’ category in the coming days,” the CAQM stated.
In the wake of Grap 3, which asks depts concerned to intensify public transport services, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said that it will be running 20 extra trips, in addition to 40 already in place since GRAP-II was implemented.
PM2.5 was the biggest pollutant in the city on Thursday. With high moisture in the city’s air, as evident from the moderate morning fog, which supports the accumulation of pollutants and discourages ventilation, AQI levels gradually soared. It rose to 424 by noon and was 426 by 3pm, with almost all monitored areas under the severe category.
Meanwhile, as per DSS, on Thursday, transport was the biggest contributor to local emissions, contributing 12.24% to the city’s PM2.5, followed by Delhi’s residential sector at 3.12%, pollutants from Sonipat at 3.5%, Panipat at 3.1%, Ghaziabad at 3.6% and Gautam Budh Nagar at 3.5%, and 2.7% due to industries.
According to the Central Pollution Control Board, the PM2.5 levels of the city oscillated between 209.5 to 290.5 micrograms per cubic metre, against national standards of 60 units and WHO’s 15 units for 24 hours.
The PM10 oscillated from 347.8 to 439.8 per cubic metre, against the national standard of 100 units and WHO’s 45 units. PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were at their peak at 8pm on Wednesday; and fell gradually thereafter."

An Air Quality Index (AQI) in the range of 0-50 is regarded as good, 51-100 as satisfactory, while 101-200 reflects moderate air quality. Levels between 201-300 are considered poor, 301-400 is very poor, and 401-500 is severe.

On Sunday, Delhi experienced improved air quality and favorable wind conditions compared to the past two weeks. Winds blew at speeds up to 15 kmph in the capital.
Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of climate change and meteorology at
Skymet, stated, ""The region received westerly winds, which are dry. The speed hovered between 10-15 kmph, starting late Saturday night, thus cleaning up the air quality. The wind speed is likely to be good for the next 2-3 days, with no possibility of fog, which means that the air quality may improve further.""
Track pollution levels in your city
Despite the current air quality conditions, Delhi remains under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) IV restrictions. Authorities may review these restrictions today.
On Saturday, stubble burning accounted for 19.58% of pollution, while transport added 16%. By Sunday, local transport contributed 18.15% to pollution, Jhajjar 8.7%, residential emissions 4.5%, and industries on the city's periphery 3.6%.
Residents in Delhi have reported issues such as breathing difficulties and fever and have called on authorities to seek a permanent solution to increasing pollution levels.

It is rated as very poor and could lead to respiratory illness on prolonged exposure. The air pollution in Bhopal, a day after the Gyaras festival, was not only the highest among major MP cities, including Indore, Gwalior, and Jabalpur, but also over 130 AQI more than a day after Diwali in Bhopal. The air quality index of Bhopal, or air pollution, has been on the rise since Diwali.
Experts pointed out that air pollution increases during this time of the year not only due to firecrackers but also due to other factors. Bonfires during winters contribute to air pollution. Pollution levels decrease during rains but rise afterward due to damaged roads and other activities, and the burning of bonfires makes it worse. Experts also noted that apart from local factors like people burning tyres and plastic during cold nights, which lead to increased pollution levels, weather also plays a role in air quality.
Meteorological department officials said that during this time of the year, winds from Punjab and Delhi blow over the state, which could cause the air quality index of MP cities to increase by up to 20 per cent. The second reason is that air pollutants come closer when the temperature falls. From the mid-troposphere, they move to the low troposphere, leading to an increase in pollution levels.
Showers do wonders to air quality. The reason why air pollution decreases during rains, experts pointed out, is that dust becomes heavy in showers and does not fly in the air. Vehicular pollution also decreases as tyres do not cause pollutants and dust to fly in the air, as it settles on the ground. This is why pollution levels decrease during rains. Officials said that apart from the damaged roads, flying dust from vehicles and an increase in construction activities after showers lead to an increase in pollution levels.

Air quality is measured by taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), RSPM10, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. Of the four, officials said PM2.5 is the most harmful to health and causes severe lung diseases. PM10 is due to dust and construction, including the building of roads, while PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity, and climatic conditions."

What’s to blame?,"Nov 14, 2024, 14:21 IST","BATHINDA: Punjab has been experiencing deteriorating air quality for the last few days despite a drop in crop residue burning cases, raising questions what’s to blame for the conditions.
If in previous years when a big part of the leftover crop residue was being burnt in fields that affected the air quality, why under fewer stubble burning cases, such conditions are persisting, asked farmers and agronomists .
“Many sections of society, including the judiciary, had been finding fault in stubble burning in worsening of the air quality of the National Capital Region at the onset of winter. Now, when farm fires have drastically decreased, why the authorities are not ready to accept that stubble burning has least contribution to it. Even Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) in its report has stated that stubble burning has a very low contribution to the air quality of Delhi in the initial part of Oct,” said farmer leaders Joginder Singh Ugrahan and Sarvan Singh Pandher.
Visibility at various places across Punjab had reached up to zero levels on Tuesday, with even flights getting affected in Amritsar.

Questions are being rai sed whether it is smog or fog that is engulfing the region. The issue came to the fore when the plane of the Vice President failed to land at Ludhiana on Tuesday due to low visibility, with smog from stubble burning being blamed for it.
Punjab Agricultural University principal agrometeorologist K K Gill said, “Going by the circumstances, it seems a mixture of smog and fog is engulfing the region. Polluting dust and aerosol particles have been hanging in the air since Diwali, leading to smog and hazy conditions”. She added that as the wind speed is minimal, pollutants, including aerosols and dust particles, are in the air, leading to smog. Stubble burning too has a contribution to it apart from firecrackers.

Another abnormality is the minimum temperature hovering up to 8°C above normal in Punjab, a rise seen after nearly 54 years.
Gill said as sunshine is not reaching the earth’s surface, low wind speed is aggravating the problem, and pollutants are not shifting.
“Lower than normal temperatures are required for foggy conditions, but we are witnessing much higher minimum temperatures, especially at nights, which is up to 8°C in certain areas, she added."

The city's Air Quality Index (AQI) was 228 on Wednesday, down slightly from 243 on Tuesday and 235 on Monday. Nov's second week has so far seen the highest air pollution levels this post-monsoon season.
Experts suggest that preventive measures are necessary, as a further drop in temperatures could worsen the air quality. Cooler air becomes denser, trapping pollutants near the ground and preventing them from dispersing.
Prof Narendra Kumar from Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University's environment department, who has studied air pollution for nearly two decades, emphasised that public cooperation is essential alongside govt efforts to address rising pollution levels.
""Even small actions, like accelerating less to reduce emissions, avoiding engine idling, maintaining vehicles with regular tune-ups, cleaning oil and air filters, using high-quality cabin air filters, carpooling, and using public transport, make a difference,"" Professor Kumar explained.

""I'm particularly focused on vehicles, as they are the largest source of air pollution, followed by stationary sources like factories, power plants, and chimney emissions,"" he said.
Prof Dhruv Sen Singh from Lucknow University's Monitoring and Climate Station highlighted that construction sites emit large amounts of ultrafine pollutants. He suggested that green nets should be mandatory at these sites, with penalties for non-compliance.

Speaking at the valedictory session of Punjab Vision 2047, Kataria argued that regulations alone cannot effectively curb the widespread practice of straw burning. “The law cannot be the only answer to stubble burning,” he said.
“When the timeframe for sowing the next crop after harvesting is so short, how will the farmer clear the field? We need to find a solution that is practical, acceptable to farmers and favourable to the environment,” the governor said.
He stressed the “need for research” to reduce reliance on agricultural chemicals without compromising crop productivity, underscoring the importance of sustainable farming practices for Punjab’s agricultural future.

While talking about the need for rejuvenation of Punjab’s economy, Kataria said until the law and order problem was solved, investors would avoid coming to Punjab. “We have to think how to engage youth, so anti-social elements are not able to misuse them. Educational institutes need to improve their training so they are able to stand on their own feet. Employment is a big solution to many issues including drug addiction,” he said. Rajya Sabha MP and organiser of Punjab Vision 2047 conclave Vikramjit Singh Sahney sought the help of the governor to solve “certain issues” related to the state.

""Reopening of Wagah border for trade can help Punjab send its products to Central Asia. The lack of international flights from Mohali and Amritsar is a deterrent to the expansion of industry. We also need a minimum support price for crops other than wheat and paddy which can solve the farming and ecological crisis of Punjab,"" he said.
Rajya Sabha MP and environmental activist Balbir Singh Seechewal lamented the poor state of Punjab’s ecology. “We call ourselves educated but our output can be seen in our river, air and land. When we were less literate, our environment was much safer,” he said.
Seechewal also talked about the need for sewage treatment plants to recycle and reuse sewage water. “The national green tribunal has already ordered fines on cities which are not treating its sewage. We have already shown how this can be done at low cost by establishing stabilisation ponds for sewage treatment in several villages. The water so treated is reused in irrigation of farms,” he said.
The session on fiscal prudence saw IAS Ajoy Kumar Sinha stress “need to spend the money taken on loans from the market in fields that can lead to good returns instead of just paying salaries”. Chiranjiv Singh, former chief secretary of Karnataka, said Punjab can learn a lot from the southern state in terms of financial growth. “Karnataka already had a very impressive education system in the 1980s which offered the manpower that helped Bangalore become an IT hub. Punjab should focus on improving primary school education specifically,” he said."

In all the Havells Studio Meditate AP 250 air purifier scores well in the design department and the compact form factor will be liked by many.
Performance
Havells Studio Meditate AP 250 air purifier delivers pretty good performance when it comes to cleaning the air inside your house. The air purifier from Havells offers a powerful filtration system which is designed to tackle multiple airborne pollutants. The air purifier comes equipped with a pre-filter mesh, H1 4 HEPA filter, anti microbial coating, granular activated carbon and TiO2 module. The top part of the air purifier houses an Airlight sealing strip which ensures that the contaminants will remain trapped inside the air purifier once they have been captured. After this the activated carbon filter absorbs the cooking odour, smoke and pet odour. The H1 4 HEPA Filter present in the air purifier traps pet dander, dust mites, airborne bacteria and other fine particles. Lastly, the pre-filter mesh traps large particles such as link, filers and pet fur. Havells Studio Meditate AP 250 offers 6 stage air purification and it promises to remove pollen, bacteria, fungal cold, microbiological impurities and VOCs from the air.

Havells Studio Mediate AP 250 air purifier works with the Sync app which is available on both Android and iOS operating systems. The app makes it easier to control the air purifier and it also offers complete analytics of the air quality in your home. Using the app you can easily control the device remotely and set schedules and monitor the AQI. Along with this, the app will also inform you about filter replacement. You can also control the Havells Studio Mediate AP 250 air purifier via voice commands. We used Amazon Alexa to control the device and it worked really well.
The purifier is designed for rooms up to 250 square feet, making it well-suited for medium-sized rooms. In performance tests, the AP 250 quickly brought down particulate levels, visibly improving air quality within 15-20 minutes of use. We successfully filtered fumes from incense sticks, cooking, and even smoking. Additionally, the purifier effectively reduced odors in the surrounding area. The HEPA filter effectively captures particles as small as 0.3 microns, which is crucial for reducing allergens and fine dust particles that can irritate respiratory systems. Additionally, the activated carbon filter performs well in neutralising odours.

The air purifier has multiple fan speeds, allowing users to customise airflow based on their needs. The higher fan settings provide faster purification but can be slightly noisier, while the lower settings are quiet enough to be used in bedrooms or during sleep. There’s also an auto mode that adjusts fan speed based on the air quality detected. The Havells Studio Mediate AP 250 air purifier also comes with a timer function, enabling users to set it to operate for a specified duration, which is both energy-saving and convenient. The Havells Studio Mediate AP 250 air purifier manages to deliver what it promises.
Verdict
Priced at Rs 21,999, the Havells Studio Air Purifier AP 250 is an impressive addition to the home, especially for users looking to improve indoor air quality in a mid-sized space. Its sleek design allows it to blend seamlessly with home decor, while the user-friendly interface makes it easy to operate.

Saturday morning is expected to experience shallow to moderate fog. Variable winds below 4 kmph are forecast for the morning, increasing to 6-8 kmph from northwest during afternoon, before decreasing again in evening hours.

The meteorological department predicts shallow fog for Saturday, with temperatures expected to range between 26 degrees Celsius and 10 degrees Celsius.
Delhi experienced eight 'severe' air quality days this month, including two 'severe-plus' days. The absence of rainfall, combined with local and regional emissions and unfavourable weather conditions, contributed to heightened pollution levels.
The lowest recorded AQI was 303, still within the 'very poor' range. November 18 saw the AQI reach 494, marking it as the second most polluted day on record. Ten days experienced AQI readings exceeding 390."

For instance, as per data from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology's system of air quality and weather forecasting and research (IITM-Safar), particulate matter or PM2.5 levels skyrocketed, hitting a barrier 3.25 times higher than the permissible limit of 60µg/m3.
Citizens from a locality of Bhosari populated by industrial units told TOI that they were well aware in advance how the four days of festivities — Oct 31 to Nov 4 — might see higher pollution levels. Hence, they decided to record these figures to have some concrete data on hand.
In this vein, a team comprising Prashant Raul, Rahul Gholap, Jay Bhat, Prakash Jukantwar and Sharmila Deo of Parisar (an organisation working for sustainable development) set out on an ‘AQI walk' through Bhosari and other areas of Pimpri Chinchwad, tracking the deteriorating air quality.

""On Nov 2, the AQI reached an average of 767 in Indrayaninagar between 7.30pm and 9.30pm. This is catastrophic. It is the air people are breathing, and these levels could cause severe health issues in everyone, whether sensitive groups like senior citizens, children and those with comorbidities, or even healthy persons,"" said Raul, who came up with the plan for the AQI walks.
He said, ""Air pollution is like a slow poison. Thousands die across the globe because of it and yet, in areas like Bhosari, where there are multiple industrial units, authorities seem to take no preventive action. This needs to change.""

Commenting on existing efforts being inadequate, Raul further said, ""The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) seems to have deployed fogging vehicles and air mist dispensers at some locations — but does this really help? Tracking pollution was initially easy on the IITM-Safar app, but that shut down a few months ago. So, I reached out to Parisar for their Air Veda monitor as our AQI walk was the need of the hour.""
The team covered areas like Indrayaninagar, Nashik Phata, Vallabhnagar and Sant Tukaram Nagar, among others. They also interacted with those bursting firecrackers and curious onlookers who asked about the AQI measuring device. The team members explained to such people the concept of AQI, what factors contribute to it, how it affects our health, which device is used to measure it and how to do so.
Raul pointed out, ""We received a lot of negative feedback on cultural grounds. However, we engaged with everyone to explain the practical reality.""
Team members told TOI that the greater the density of pollutants in the air, the higher the AQI goes. Starting from zero, AQI recorded from 0-50 is considered safe, 50-100 moderate, 100-150 unhealthy for sensitive groups, 150-200 unhealthy, 200-300 very unhealthy and 300-500 hazardous.
Deo, who through Parisar has been an advocate against rising air pollution, said, ""The AQI during Diwali was either ‘very poor' or ‘severe' across the city. Reasons for air quality decline can be a combination of factors like rainfall reduction, changes in climatic conditions, vehicular emissions, construction and road dust, garbage burning, etc. Bursting firecrackers deteriorates it further.""
She said, ""There needs to be serious consideration about banning crackers as the health of all living beings can be majorly compromised by this trend. People found it difficult to breathe during Diwali days due to congestion caused by a haze of toxic fumes. There needs to be much more awareness about the impacts of firecrackers to bring about behavioural changes."""

In an appeal, the Mangaluru-based urban environmental NGO, APD Foundation, has urged the minister for forest, ecology and environment Eshwar Khandre, to make this shift mandatory.
In a letter to the minister, Abdullah A Rehman, founder and CEO of APD Foundation, said that Mangaluru's public transport, comprises both govt and private sector operators. The transport industry is highly efficient and organised, making it well-suited for a phased EV conversion. He proposed that financial incentives, partnerships with EV manufacturers, and collaborations with environmental organisations could help ease this transition. He also encouraged the minister to prioritise EV adoption in public transport, highlighting that EVs could significantly reduce harmful emissions, improve air quality, and lower noise levels, as electric buses are notably quieter. He said that the copy of the letter was submitted to the DC.
Dilraj Alva from the Dakshina Kannada City Bus Association said that introducing EV buses in the city could probably take another year or two due to infrastructure and cost challenges. He said that electric buses are generally purchased through aggregators and not directly by individuals. Essential infrastructure, such as charging stations, is also needed, which adds to the complexity.
""While diesel buses cost around Rs 30-40 lakh, EV buses are approximately Rs 1 crore,"" he noted, emphasising the need to assess the financial viability and funding options. Alva said that discussions took place with several companies over recent years, including a meeting held in Manipal.

He further questioned the assumption that switching to EVs would significantly reduce pollution, pointing out that EVs are not entirely pollution-free, especially considering the environmental impact of battery disposal.

Autism in kids in the recent past has been witnessing a rise and a new research study suggests that there may be a link between the environment pollutants and the spike in cases of autism spectrum disorder. Research findings suggest a potential link between exposure to air pollution, heavy metals, pesticides, and industrial chemicals during pregnancy or early life and autism. Inhaling poor-quality air in these critical stages may increase the likelihood of developing autism.
Autism is a complex condition influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

Studies revealed that prenatal and early-life exposure to air pollutants, especially nitrogen dioxide may increase the risk of autism in children. Apart from that, exposure to neurotoxic compounds like mercury, arsenic has been associated with brain development issues and it is said that pregnant women might be affected and it may harm the fetal development.
Not all children are affected by these pollutants when exposed, but reducing the exposure to toxins is beneficial for health outcomes in a broader range. According to a new research, polluted air breathed in by women during pregnancy may be linked to a greater risk of developing autism as the bloodstream through the womb might be affected by the pollutants.


Every 3 in 100 kids affected by ASD

A recent analysis in the US mentioned that the rates of ASD has tripled in children in the past few decades and noted that about 3 in every 100 kids have Autism. The American Lung Association report revealed that 39% percent of the US is affected with air pollution and it noted cities with the worst air quality index that includes Phoenix, Arizona, San Jose, California, Eugene, Oregon among others.
What is Autism: Uncovering hidden causes

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that affects the way people communicate, behave, or interact with others. A person is more likely to have it if someone in their family like a brother, sister or parent is on the spectrum. However, it doesn’t always run in families. Babies who weigh less than 4 pounds, 7 ounces at birth are more at risk of ASD by age 21 than the general population.
Several studies found that pregnant women with diabetes – including the temporary kind – had a higher risk of delivering a child with autism than mothers who weren't diabetic. According to Kennedy Krieger Institute, pregnant women with diabetes may face a higher risk of delivering a child with autism than mothers who weren't diabetic."

He noted that even before this year’s record-breaking smog, 12% of deaths in children under five in Pakistan were attributed to air pollution—a number likely to increase with the ongoing crisis.
Fadil warned of the additional risks to expectant mothers, stating that exposure to polluted air increases the likelihood of premature births, respiratory complications, and low birth weight. ""When pregnant women are exposed to polluted air, they are more likely to give birth prematurely, face respiratory issues, and their babies may have a low birth weight.

""Cumulative increase in the concentration of PM10 and PM2.5 (respirable dust) may be attributed to the change in weather and temperature drop. Further, calm conditions are augmenting the condition due to limited horizontal and vertical distribution of pollutants,"" said environmentalist at the department of environment science, Prof Narendra Kumar.
He said the change in weather is also adding moisture (fog), which is favouring the reaction in the air. Ongoing construction activities and firecrackers during Diwali might have contributed significantly to the respirable dust. The onset of inversion conditions is also contributing, along with continuously increasing vehicle density.

Prof Kumar recommended precautions with a rise in air pollution levels. ""Elderly and children, in particular, should avoid outdoor activities during the early morning and evening. People with pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases are advised to stay indoors,"" he advised.
He said water sprinkling can be done to prevent the re-entrainment of settled dust. Outdoor burning should be avoided. Roadside vendors, drivers and traffic managers are advised to wear a recommended quality mask. Plenty of fluid should be taken to flush out the toxins. Elderly people should avoid morning walks.

Both PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations substantially exceeded permissible limits owing to local pollutants, including vehicular emissions and dust.
The monitoring station at Gwal Pahari recorded highest PM2.5 level at 345 µg/m³, followed by Vikas Sadan (338 µg/m³) and Teri Gram (312 µg/m³), according to CPCB data. PM10 levels peaked at Gwal Pahari (349 µg/m³), followed by Teri Gram (333 µg/m³) and Sector 51 (330 µg/m³). Vikas Sadan station failed to record PM10 levels. CPCB has set annual average permissible limits of 60 µg/m³ for PM2.5 and 100 µg/m³ for PM10. According to CPCB guidelines, ""moderate"" AQI affects those with respiratory conditions, while ""poor"" AQI causes widespread discomfort during extended exposure.
Delhi's air quality worsened on Monday as the pollution reading climbed back to ‘very poor' while some localities recorded ‘severe' AQI.
On Sunday, the average AQI read 334, indicating pollution at the lower end of ‘very poor' range. By noon on Monday, AQI had risen to 351, with areas like Bawana and Jahangirpuri logging ‘severe' quality. By 4pm, the air had deteriorated to an overall AQI of 352, with five monitoring stations recording ‘severe' levels. Jahangirpuri was the worst with AQI of 430.
Explaining the rise in pollution levels, India Meteorological Department said on Monday, ""The mainly smog conditions with wind speed less than 6 kmph from variable directions prevailed over the region in the forenoon.""
According to the air quality early warning system, pollution is likely to stagnate at the ‘very poor' level for several days. ""Meteorological conditions are likely to remain extremely unfavourable for effective dispersion of pollutants. The air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor' category from Tuesday to Thursday. The outlook for the subsequent six days is that the air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor' category,"" said IITM's air quality early warning system's bulletin on Monday.
It added, ""The predominant surface wind is likely to come from south/southwest direction in Delhi with wind speed 4-10kmph, smog/mist/shallow to moderate fog at a few places likely in the morning, smog/mist likely at night and mainly clear sky on Tuesday.""
IITM's Decision Support System observed a gradual drop in the share of stubble burning in the city's PM2.5 from 20.6% on Friday to 16.8% on Saturday and 15.3% on Sunday. On Monday, transport proved the biggest source of pollution in Delhi, accounting for 12.1% of PM2.5. Vehicles contributed 6.6% of PM2.5 in Gautam Budh Nagar, 4.3% in Ghaziabad, 4.4% in Gurgaon and 4.6% in Faridabad.
Dr RR Dutta of Paras Health said, ""To minimise the impact of poor air quality on health, especially during high-smog periods, there are several precautions residents can take. Staying indoors during peak smog hours, particularly early in the morning, is advisable, as pollution levels tend to be higher then. For those who must go outside, wearing an N95 mask can help filter out fine particulate matter that may otherwise enter the lungs. Using air purifiers indoors can also be beneficial, particularly for individuals with pre-existing respiratory or heart conditions.""
""Keeping windows and doors closed, staying hydrated, and including antioxidant-rich foods in the diet may help support respiratory health. Those at higher risk, including the elderly, young children, and individuals with asthma or other respiratory conditions, should avoid strenuous outdoor activities on days when air quality is poor. Anyone experiencing symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe coughing should consult a healthcare provider promptly, as prolonged exposure to poor air quality can have serious consequences,"" he added."

NEW DELHI: About a kilometre southeast of the waste-to-energy plant in Okhla, which incinerates about 2,000 tonnes of solid waste every day, is Jasola Vihar, home of 78-year-old Dev Kumar Bansal and his family. Like countless others in the area, such as in Sukhdev Vihar, Haji Colony and Jamia Nagar, Bansal suffers from seasonal ailments that don't disappear easily.

His chest pains and headaches have become more aggravating in the past few years, as has the air around his home, which remains visibly polluted even during the summer. The septuagenarian moved to the locality in 2012, a place that seemed serene and open. He claims his dream of a comfortable life in Jasola Vihar turned into a nightmare when the WTE plant was commissioned soon after.
""Almost everyone here has problems related to breathing, itchy eyes and headaches. Simple fevers last longer and people cough for months,"" alleged Bansal, who is president of Jasola Vihar's Pocket 1&2 Residents' Welfare Association. ""I was a fairly healthy person and didn't have medical problems. Now, the doctor says my lungs will die before me. People get tired quickly. It seems youngsters are ageing fast. We cannot even go for morning walks. We are living proof of the effect of toxins the waste-to-energy plant is emitting. We cannot go for morning walks.""
The WTE plant, operational since Jan 2012, has allegedly been releasing toxins all these years and it has been officially reprimanded for flouting pollution norms, yet has managed to increase its incinerating capacity. There is a plan now to raise power generation from 23MW to 40MW while burning more garbage, leaving the residents counting on the Supreme Court to deliver them from what they say is the bane of their lives.

A recent report by The New York Times claimed that the plant was releasing heavy metals and breathable toxins into the air. ""The NYT story provides foolproof evidence of the impact of the power plant on residents living in its vicinity,"" maintained Swati Singh Sambyal, an independent resource management expert. ""The WTE plant incinerates about 2,000 tonnes per day of mixed waste, 30-40% of which becomes highly toxic bottom ash, which is being disposed of without proper safety measures. This is contaminating our air, soil and water. We do not need quick fix, silver-bullet solutions for our cities, but holistic, circular resource management options that put people at the centre of it.""

Complaining that the city's WTE plants aggravated the air quality, Atin Biswas, programme director, municipal solid waste unit, Centre for Science and Environment, claimed, ""In India, certain principles are widely flouted by WTE plants. For instance, either wet waste or dry waste is to be used as fuel to produce energy, but these plants collect mixed waste for burning. This has high moisture content and needs extra fuel to incinerate or it won't burn well. Besides, the temperature standard of 850–1,450 degrees Celsius has to be maintained so that there is complete combustion to avoid residual emission.""
Burning mixed waste, Biswas explained, can produce toxic particles, ranging from carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulphur dioxide due to incomplete combustion. ""These particles can cause serious respiratory diseases and also lead to chronic lung problems, such as asthma. People who are residing in the close proximity of the plants are extremely susceptible to health hazards,"" he said.
Biswas added there are apprehensions that the 53 WTE plants operating in the country are consuming more energy than they are producing.

Gynaecologist Neeta Misra often advises her pregnant patients to shift from the neighbourhood to other places, perhaps their relatives' houses. Dr Misra, who lives and practises in Sukhdev Vihar and is a consultant at nearby Apollo Hospital, said her patients often visited her with breathing problems, skin issues and migraines and these had increased over the years.

""People here have the sensation of a foreign body in their eyes at all times,"" said Misra, also claiming that her mother, who visited from Agra, a fairly polluted city itself, complained of itchy, red and painful eyes. ""So you can imagine the conditions here,"" she said, adding that in winter, she takes a literal week-long breather in places like Amarkantak or Bengaluru.
Environmental activist Bhavreen Kandhari, who has been leading protests against WTE plants, said, ""Air pollution in Delhi-NCR has reached critical levels, waste incineration plants continue to burn thousands of tonnes of unsegregated waste each day, releasing hazardous emissions and worsening the already polluted air. Despite their dangerous impact on public health and the environment, these plants are expanding, threatening the community's right to breathe clean air. To truly address air pollution, Delhi must urgently prioritise sustainable waste management practices and byelaws over incineration, must enforce pollution controls strictly and protect its citizens from the grave health risks posed by toxic air.""
Kandhari added that with the NYT report revealing toxic levels of heavy metals and chemicals, it was clear that the Okhla WTE plant was endangering people's lives."

During a review meeting on air pollution held by Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Nov 8, Delhi environment department said that out of 57 sources, the highest were identified at Mundka and Anand Vihar, which was seven each.
A senior official said a fresh mapping of sources was done ahead of this winter, along with a survey on the old sources existing at the hotspots. ""We have revised the sources at each hotspot. The new sources have been shared with agencies concerned... to resolve the issues soon,"" the official said.

At Anand Vihar, the pollution sources include a damaged road at the bus station, congestion on Chaudhary Charan Singh Marg, a construction site, a broken divider under the foot overbridge and roadside dust. Jahangirpuri's five major pollution sources are biomass burning, heavy congestion and road dust, Bhalswa sanitary landfill, a construction site and an unpaved road, construction and demolition plant, and DMRC casting plant.
Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director for research and advocacy at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said: ""It is important to take hyperlocal action at hotspots.... This may lead to some local reduction. For sustained improvement, we need to scale up city-wide action for overall improvement in air quality.""
An official of the environment department said 10% of Delhi's total water sprinklers and mechanised road sweepers have been deployed at these 13 hotspots. Twenty-two water sprinklers and eight out of 85 mechanised road sweeping machines have been deployed in the hotspots. A total of 60 anti-mobile smog guns have also been deployed. Besides, 84 enforcement teams of traffic police are on the ground.
Delhi Pollution Control Committee and Central Pollution Control Board identified 13 pollution hotspots in 2018. Hotspots are defined as those whose annual PM2.5 concentration was higher than the mean PM2.5 levels of the city. These are Anand Vihar, Mundka, Wazirpur, Jahangirpuri, RK Puram, Rohini, Punjabi Bagh, Okhla, Bawana, Vivek Vihar, Narela, Ashok Vihar, and Dwarka."

""Cumulative increase in the concentration of PM10 and PM2.5 (respirable dust) may be attributed to the change in weather and temperature drop. Further, calm conditions are augmenting the condition due to limited horizontal and vertical distribution of pollutants,"" said environmentalist at the department of environment science, Prof Narendra Kumar.
He said the change in weather is also adding moisture (fog), which is favouring the reaction in the air. Ongoing construction activities and firecrackers during Diwali might have contributed significantly to the respirable dust. The onset of inversion conditions is also contributing, along with continuously increasing vehicle density.

Prof Kumar recommended precautions with a rise in air pollution levels. ""Elderly and children, in particular, should avoid outdoor activities during the early morning and evening. People with pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases are advised to stay indoors,"" he advised.
He said water sprinkling can be done to prevent the re-entrainment of settled dust. Outdoor burning should be avoided. Roadside vendors, drivers and traffic managers are advised to wear a recommended quality mask. Plenty of fluid should be taken to flush out the toxins. Elderly people should avoid morning walks.
Other UP cities monitored by CPCB where AQI crossed the 200 mark were Baghpat (246), Bulandshahr (204), Ghaziabad (252), Greater Noida (285), Hapur (248), Noida (240) and Muzaffarnagar (240)."

A sharp increase in cancer cases is being caused by changes in lifestyle, tobacco use, poor eating habits, and insufficient physical activity. Lung, bladder, breast, prostate, and blood cancers are becoming more common as a result of increased exposure to airborne toxins. According to predictions from the Health Ministry, there will be about 800,000 new cases of cancer each year, with tobacco-related malignancies making up as much as 35–50% of all cancers in men and 17% in women.
India is experiencing an increase in the annual incidence rate of cancer.

Presently, over 14 lakh new cases of cancer are reported in India each year, and almost 9 lakh individuals pass away from the disease. Tobacco use, alcohol consumption, illnesses such as Helicobacter pylori, Hepatitis virus, and HPV, changes in lifestyle, environmental factors, poor diets, and sedentary lifestyles are all to blame.
Environmental changes, especially increased air pollution, are important, but lifestyle choices also play a big effect.

Rising rates of lung cancer, including cases among non-smokers, are associated with India's high levels of air pollution, particularly PM2.5 exposure. Communities in industrial locations are impacted by the increased risk of several cancers caused by industrial pollution contaminating their water and land.
On Thursday, Delhi-NCR's air quality remained dangerously bad. The city's average Air Quality Index (AQI), according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), was 362.

A causal relationship between outdoor (ambient) air pollution, particularly PM 2.5 in outdoor air, and the incidence and mortality of lung and breast cancer is also supported by a large body of evidence from human and experimental animal research as well as mechanistic evidence.
Though in small amounts, it is susceptible to various cancers, including leukemia (blood cancer), prostate cancer, and bladder cancer. Although further research is required, outdoor air pollution may potentially be linked to a lower cancer survival rate.

According to Dr. Mohit Saxena, Consultant, Head Of Department (HOD) - Medical Oncology
Manipal Hospital, Gurugram, “The Air Quality Index (AQI) in India is steadily deteriorating, leading to a rise in the incidence and mortality rate due to lung cancer. Lung cancer risk associated with PM 2.5 μ (from traffic fumes, industrial emissions, and burning biomass) was higher in former smokers, current smokers, and even non-smokers. Water and soil contamination from industrial pollutants increases the risk of many cancers like bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and blood cancer.”
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), outdoor air pollution is a Group 1 carcinogen, which means that there is enough data to draw the conclusion that it causes cancer in people.
In India, emissions from automobiles, factories, and biomass burning are the main sources of air pollution.

According to Dr. Sajjan Rajpurohit, Senior Director of Medical Oncology at Max Super Speciality Hospital, these pollutants include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), formaldehyde, and benzene, which are known to cause cancer, as reported by IANS. Cancer can arise as a result of cellular alterations brought on by prolonged exposure to certain chemicals.
One of the most dangerous elements of air pollution is particulate matter, or PM2.5. According to Rajpurohit, the microscopic particles have the ability to enter the bloodstream and travel deep into the lungs.
According to the health expert, people with pre-existing medical disorders, the elderly, and children are most susceptible to the negative impacts of air pollution. The public health issue may worsen as a result of these groups' increasing susceptibility to cancer.
Cancer cases can be avoided by leading a healthy lifestyle that includes a balanced diet, frequent exercise, abstaining from alcohol and tobacco, and limiting exposure to PM-2.5. The need for early detection for improved treatment results must also be emphasized. To aid in the efficient management of cancer, routine screenings for breast, lung, colorectal, and oral cancers are recommended.

NEW DELHI: The streak of five consecutive ‘severely' polluted days is over, but it isn't time to be complacent. Around four such episodes of extreme pollution occur every winter season from Nov to Jan. For the next few days, however, the air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor' category. Experts warned that since local and regional emissions continued to remain elevated, any adverse meteorological condition could push the air quality back into the ‘severe' zone.
Check Delhi AQI here
When the pollution hit an Air Quality Index of 400, it is deemed to be ‘severe'. In Nov so far, Delhi has recorded seven ‘severe' days, including five such days on the trot. Last year, there were four episodes of this sort in the winter.
Nov last year recorded three smog episodes when AQI was consistently 390 or above. The first streak stretched from Nov 2 to Nov 9, with rain on Nov 10 providing a temporary relief before another episode lasting from Nov 14 to 17. Delhiites fell into the grip of a third spell from Nov 22 to 27, before rain again helped provide a respite. The following month saw another smog spell from Dec 22 to 24.

Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Research and Advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, ""Smog episodes, sometimes several of smaller duration and sometimes of longer duration, are normal during Nov. Subsequently, episodes also build up in late Dec and Jan. Meteorology plays a role in this build-up. But severity depends on the level of local and regional pollution.""

According to an analysis of the past five years by Delhi Pollution Control Committee, the Nov 1-15 period is the most polluted stretch in the year with an average AQI of 371. The Dec 15-31 fortnight is the second most polluted with an average AQI of 354. The third worst polluted period is from Jan 1 to 15 with an average AQI of 328.

Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet Weather, explained, ""With cold north-westerly winds reaching the plains, the minimum temperature drops and makes dispersing pollutants from the atmosphere difficult. The lower the minimum temperatures dips, the thicker is the inversion layer. And the thicker the inversion layer, the more difficult for sun rays or winds to penetrate and disperse the pollutants.""
The number of ‘severe' pollution days fluctuates every winter season depending on the weather conditions. The winter months of 2023 and 2022 saw, respectively, 15 and six ‘severe' days, while 2021 recorded 24 such days.
Dipankar Saha, former head of Central Pollution Control Board's air laboratory, said, ""Air is a dynamic system and the intrusion of pollutants from neighbouring states can't be denied. Everyone has to work to control emissions on the ground, particularly at the source. It can't be business as usual in the winter months across the entire Indo-Gangetic Plains."""

""The spread of conjunctivitis/ pink eye disease due to bacterial or viral infection, smoke, dust or chemical exposure is posing a serious and imminent threat to public health,"" it said.
While outdoor activities including outdoor sports events, exhibitions and festivals, and outdoor dining at restaurants have been prohibited, ""unavoidable religious rites"" are exempt from this direction, the order said.
Some outlets like pharmacies, oil depots, dairy shops, and fruit and vegetable shops have similarly been exempted from the directions to close by 8 p.m. local time.

Lahore's air quality remained hazardous on Monday, with an index score of more than 600, according to IQAir, but this was significantly lower than the 1,900 that it touched in some places earlier this month.
A score of 0-50 is considered 'good'.
Several parts of South Asia are engulfed by a toxic haze each winter as cold air traps dust, emissions, and smoke from farm fires.
Punjab has blamed its particularly toxic air this year on pollution wafting in from India, where northern parts have also been battling hazardous air, and has said it will take the issue up with the neighbouring country through its foreign ministry.
India's Supreme Court on Monday directed the Delhi government to decide by Nov. 25 on imposing a 'perpetual ban' on firecrackers, legal news portal Bar and Bench reported.

""The right to live in a pollution-free atmosphere is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution. Prima facie, we are of the view that no religion promotes any activity that promotes pollution or compromises with health of the people,"" the apex court said.

The apex also directed the Delhi government to take a decision on the perpetual ban of firecrackers by November 25.
Delhi grapples with pollution
The court’s decision follows reports indicating that pollution levels in Delhi reached record highs this Diwali, exceeding levels from previous years. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) had already issued an order banning the manufacture, storage, sale, and use of firecrackers until January 1, 2025, tasking the Delhi Police with enforcing this restriction.
During earlier hearings, the top court had expressed its frustration with the lack of coordination among the Centre, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), and state governments, notably Punjab and Haryana, in addressing stubble burning. The court noted that the CAQM’s response was largely “eyewash” and lacked concrete action, with minimal penalties imposed on violators.

In recent weeks, Delhi has been struggling with dangerously high levels of air pollution.
On Monday morning, Delhi's air quality remained in the 'very poor' category, with an overall AQI of 349, according to SAFAR-India data. Hospitals across the city reported a surge in respiratory cases, including people without prior breathing issues. Thick smog blanketed the city, and toxic foam was visible on the Yamuna River at Kalindi Kunj. AQI readings were notably high in several areas, with figures ranging from 206 at Sri Aurobindo Marg to 385 at Anand Vihar. Doctors warned that the pollution is severely impacting public health, especially among children and the elderly."

They have advised residents to look out for signs of respiratory distress and seek medical attention, if required, and avoid crowded places to reduce the risk of viral infections.
Prof (Dr) G C Khilnani, chairman, PSRI Institute of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, and member of the WHO Technical Advisory Group on Global Air Pollution and Health, highlighted the recurring problem of pollution in Delhi-NCR during winter months, which often leads to various health issues. He said besides common symptoms, there is a higher incidence of serious conditions such as pneumonia, asthma, bronchitis and heart attacks, as well as increased mortality attributable to air pollution.
Dr Khilnani also cited a Chicago study revealing the significant reduction in life expectancy for Indians by 5.3 years, particularly Delhiites (11.3 years), due to pollution. ""During Covid, we saw higher mortality in areas where there were higher levels of air pollution (Germany, Italy and the US),"" he added.
According to Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, elderly people, children, pregnant women and those with pre-existing health conditions, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cardiovascular disease, are particularly vulnerable to the effects of pollution. Their respiratory systems are either underdeveloped or compromised, making them more susceptible to infections or exacerbations of chronic conditions.

Dr Randeep Guleria, chairman, Medanta, Gurgaon, said children in highly polluted cities like Delhi have been found to have poorer lung capacity compared to those in less polluted regions, making them a high-risk group for long-term health effects. He advised regularly checking the AQI and avoiding outdoor activities when levels are high.
""Air pollution can cause wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath, even in people who aren't vulnerable or who don't have lung disease. So, we must be very careful,"" said Dr Neetu Jain, senior consultant, pulmonology, critical care and sleep medicine, PSRI Hospital.

According to Dr Navneet Sood, senior consultant of pulmonology, Dharamshila Narayana Hospital, eating foods high in antioxidants, like fruits and leafy greens, can help reduce the oxidative stress that pollution causes. ""Drinking an adequate amount of water is just as essential, as it aids the body in eliminating toxins,"" he added.
Dr Sandeep Nayar, principal director and head of chest and respiratory diseases, BLK Max Super Speciality Hospital, recommended minimising exposure to pollutants, both indoors and outdoors. He suggested refraining from burning wood or charcoal and opting for carpooling or public transportation for commuting.
According to Dr Nayar, wearing masks provides limited benefits, and only N95 masks should be used. Air purifiers, he said, can be beneficial for the elderly and those with chronic illnesses. However, to maximise their effectiveness, the room should stay closed at all times."

On Sunday, both PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations substantially exceeded permissible limits owing to local pollutants, including vehicular emissions and dust. The air monitoring station at Gwal Pahari recorded the highest PM2.5 level at 312 µg/m³, followed by Vikas Sadan (307 µg/m³) and Teri Gram (278 µg/m³), according to CPCB data.

Meanwhile, doctors said they were witnessing many more cases of respiratory issues in the recent days. ""Every winter, the national capital and its surrounding areas are blanketed in toxic smog which is made worse by bursting firecrackers during festivities. Post-harvest stubble burning ahead of winter sowing aggravates the situation. These factors cause a surge in respiratory illnesses, and people also experience burning eyes, heart ailments, sore throats, skin allergies, among other health problems,"" said Dr Kuldeep Kumar Grover, head of critical care and pulmonology, CK Birla Hospital, Gurgaon."

Track pollution levels in your city

For the past few weeks, Delhi has been grappling with extremely high levels of air pollution, primarily attributed to stubble burning in neighboring states.

Doctors have reported a noticeable link between deteriorating air quality and a rise in respiratory illnesses. Dr. Bobby Bhalotra, vice chairman of respiratory medicine at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, noted a surge in patients experiencing breathing issues, along with exacerbated asthma and COPD symptoms.
Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai recently emphasized the need for collaborative action from neighboring states to tackle the pollution crisis.
Doctor recommends school closures for children
Doctors report that even individuals without a history of respiratory issues are now experiencing breathing problems. Dr. Nikhil Modi, senior consultant for respiratory critical care at Apollo Hospital, highlighted that, ""We have seen the air quality index (AQI). It is more than 400 and even 500 in many places.
""Due to this, our regular patients, who have asthma and COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) are having exacerbations. They are having more breathing difficulty.
They land up in emergencies to take nebulizers, and some of them require admission. Apart from the regular patients, what we are seeing are those who don't have any respiratory issues in the past, they are coming to us with runny noses, sneezing, and coughs, and they are also having increasing difficulties. So the number of cases has suddenly gone up,"" Nikhil said.
Dr. Nikhil further advised that the government should consider closing schools, as children remain particularly vulnerable. He noted that authorities have closed schools in the past when pollution levels exceeded a certain threshold."

According to Swiss air quality monitor IQAir, Lahore’s AQI rose to 760, while Multan reached a staggering 1,914, making it one of the most polluted cities worldwide.
The extreme pollution has left authorities scrambling to control the smog, with limited success reported.
Lahore, under a thick blanket of smog for days, has witnessed widespread road closures due to low visibility, leading to multiple accidents. A serious incident on GT Road near Kalashah Kako saw nine people injured when a van collided with a stationary truck, its driver unable to see the parked vehicle through the dense haze.
The smog has also forced Lahore high court to mandate a shutdown of all trade activities by 8 pm and close markets on Sundays, aiming to minimize pollution-inducing activity.

In Multan, conditions reached what experts called ""apocalyptic"" levels, with the AQI exceeding 2,000 on Friday morning. The concentration of PM2.5—a hazardous particulate matter known to cause severe respiratory and cardiovascular issues—was recorded at 947 micrograms per cubic meter, nearly 190 times above World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The WHO deems PM2.5 levels above five micrograms per cubic meter harmful.

In response, the state government is on high alert, implementing emergency measures to curb pollution levels. Public parks and museums across major cities have been closed until at least November 17.
Authorities have also faced criticism for failing to enforce preemptive anti-smog directives, with citizens often seen without masks despite the severe air quality.
Multan, the largest city in southern Punjab, recorded an extremely dangerous Air Quality Index (AQI) of 2,135 between 8am and 9am on Friday, according to data from IQAir, as reported by Dawn. Later in the day, the AQI readings remained perilous, reaching 980 by 10 pm—more than three times above the “hazardous” threshold of 300. Several monitors across Multan, including those at the WWF-Pakistan Office, Shamsabad Colony, and Multan Cantonment, showed AQI levels as high as 2,316, 1,635, and 1,527 respectively.
Authorities in Pakistan have attributed the worsening air quality in Lahore to cross-border winds carrying pollutants from neighboring India, alleging that these winds have pushed smog levels to ""dangerous"" extremes."

Sector 51 recorded the highest AQI in city at 305, which falls in the 'very poor' category. Gwal Pahari and Teri Gram were not far behind with both falling in the ‘poor' category with AQIs of 298 and 249 respectively.
Vikas Sadan breathed better with an AQI of 197 (moderate). However, this level, too, requires caution, especially for those with preexisting health issues.
The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) predicted that air quality is likely to remain within the 'very poor' category in the coming days due to unfavourable meteorological factors.

""The predominant surface wind is likely to come from the southeast direction in Delhi with a speed of 04-10 kmph. Smog or shallow to moderate fog or mist is likely in the morning and night with a clear afternoon. Meteorological conditions are likely to be extremely unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants,"" SAFAR stated.
According to experts, in addition to the low wind speed and humidity, anthropogenic factors have also contributed to the persistence of pollutants. ""Pollutants from garbage burning, road dust, and vehicular emissions are currently dominating the city's air profile. The combination of slower wind speed and humid south-easterly winds is preventing any effective dispersal of pollutants. With no major change in weather conditions, the AQI is likely to stay between ‘poor' and ‘very poor' in the coming days,"" said Sachin Panwar, an independent air quality expert.

Meanwhile, the temperature in the city remained above the season's normal on Saturday. The nighttime temperature soared to 19.2 degrees Celsius, five notches above normal. It was 17.9 degrees Celsius the previous day. The daytime temperature, also three points above the normal, was recorded at 31.8 degrees Celsius, up from Friday's 30.9 degrees Celsius.
According to the IMD forecast, no significant change in temperature is expected, with the minimum and maximum temperatures being around 17-19 degrees Celsius and 28-30 degrees Celsius during the next week.

But their extended run on NCR roads, because of slack enforcement and unwillingness of vehicle owners to let them go, is an aspect of the fight against pollution that has received little attention.
Winter or summer, vehicular pollution remains the predominant contributor to high PM2.5 levels in the Delhi air shed. In Noida and Ghaziabad, ELVs make up around 20% of all vehicles registered, so their share in total emissions will be no insignificant one.
ELVs, defined in Delhi-NCR as petrol vehicles that are more than 15 years old and diesel vehicles above 10, were banned by an order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2015. But scrapping has been slow, and without a tracking system that is monitored end to end, police and the transport department don't quite know the status of ELVs.

Ghaziabad has four scrapping centres – Seven Star Auto Scrap, Saral Auto Scrapping India, MSSS Enterprises and Herwin Motors Industries Pvt Ltd – while Gautam Budh Nagar has Maruti Suzuki Toyotsu India in Noida (Sector 80) and Mahindra MSTC Recycling in Ecotech-1 (Greater Noida).
If vehicles come to these centres, then the regional transport office will know. Problem is, very few come. So far, going by RTO estimates in Noida, around 25,000 vehicles have been scrapped. This is only around 15% of the 1.86 lakh ELVs identified from vehicles registered in the city. Some may have gone to unauthorised scrap workshops and some sold or shifted to residents living outside NCR where the NGT ban does not apply. But it's likely that a large number of these ELVs are still on roads.

Nawab Khan, owner of Seven Star Auto Scrap, told TOI there is lack of awareness among vehicle owners due to which the pace of authorised scrapping is slow. ""We scrap only 10-15 vehicles per month. If the govt takes up this initiative and raises awareness, then the number of vehicles that are brought here will certainly go up,"" he said. Khan has been running his facility for one and a half years.
Between Noida and Ghaziabad, these are 4.2 lakh ELVs. Of these, around 90,000 are relatively higher polluting diesel vehicles. Noida has 1.5 lakh petrol ELVs and around 39,000 diesel ELVs while Ghaziabad has 2.9 lakh petrol ELVs and around 50,000 diesel ELVs.
For authorised scrapping, ELV owners need to submit a form on the Parivahan portal, share vehicle details, select the scrapping centre, and submit the form. The scrapping centre evaluates the vehicle and quotes a price for the ELV. If the owner agrees to the price, the staff come to pick the vehicle up. Then a certificate is issued to the ELV owner, which can be submitted to the ARTO to deregister the vehicle.
Udit Narayan Pandey, assistant regional transport officer (ARTO-enforcement), Noida, admitted ""the pace of scrapping is slow"".""The transport department is conducting a drive targeting ELVs in compliance with GRAP (graded response action plan) and directives from NGT,"" he said.
The transport department has decided to take data from toll plazas to track ELVs. ""We will take details of vehicles from toll plazas in Jewar and the Noida-Delhi borders. Teams will issue fines if they are caught on the spot,"" he added.
PK Singh, regional transport officer of Ghaziabad, said a similar drive is on in the city. ""We will further expedite the process,"" he said. Last month the UP govt announced a 75% tax exemption for vehicles registered before 2003 and a 50% rebate for those registered before 2008 upon scrapping."

The 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) in the city was recorded at 176, which, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), is moderate. However, as per the CPCB's index, ‘moderate' air can still cause breathing discomfort to people with respiratory and heart diseases.
The pollution level came down by 56 notches in the last 48 hours, with the average AQI recorded at 232 on November 7. Of the six monitoring stations located in the city, the one in Samanpura recorded the highest AQI on Saturday at 293, which was in the ‘poor' category. Patna City's air index was recorded at 166, followed by Muradpur (153), Rajbanshi Nagar (152), Planetarium (150) and DRM office-Khagaul (142).
According to the experts, the poor air can cause breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good', 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory', 101 and 200 ‘moderate', 201 and 300 ‘poor', 301 and 400 ‘very poor', and 401 and 500 ‘severe', as per the CPCB's guidelines.
Apart from Patna, several other towns in Bihar recorded moderate air, including Araria (200), Aurangabad (107), Bettiah (106), Bhagalpur (110), Biharsharif (110), Chhapra (104), Kishanganj (123), Purnia (143) and Rajgir (102).

According to the meteorologists, there is no possibility of any change in the weather for the next five days. Dry weather will prevail across the state and the wind will remain calm, making it favourable for the dust particles to settle in the environment, owing to which the pollution level may slightly rise in the next 48 hours.

Its inherently dusty air is made worse by countless construction sites, uncovered construction material, heaps of horticulture waste and road dust.
For the past four days, the average AQI at Sector 116 monitoring station has remained well above 300. On Friday, it was recorded at 324, with PM2.5 concentration peaking at 402 around 2am.
On Friday, workers hired by Noida Authority health department were seen physically sweeping the road near Ved Van in Sector 78. Dust was seen flying as no water had been sprinkled at the spot. A little away, in Sector 79, an uncovered pile of construction debris was heaped along the roadside. Sand and other construction waste were also spotted on the stretch from Ved Van Park to Hanuman temple. Near Noida Authority's C&D plant in Sector 79, mounds of garbage and sand were littered. Multiple potholes near Sector 51 metro station kicked up dust in the area.
""The stretch from Sector 79 to a C&D plant at Sector 80 is dusty. A drive down the stretch will leave a chalky taste in your mouth. This area should ideally be a green belt,"" Sanwarjeet Dasoundi of Sector 79 sector, said.

In 2017, Noida resident Amit Gupta had filed a petition in NGT on dust pollution and poor air quality in the 7x sectors. The tribunal had ordered Noida Authority not to undertake dry sweeping of roads, however, no steps were taken subsequently. The petitioner now plans to file a contempt of court case in NGT.
Construction activities in nearby sectors — Ivory County in Sector 112 and Unitech in Sector 113 — too adds to the pollution. ""Soil is being dug without following norms. We can barely open our windows,"" said a resident of a nearby housing society.
While GRAP Stage II, which is currently in force, permits construction and demolition activities, but it requires local authorities to inspect them to ensure strict enforcement of dust control measures.
When approached, Noida Authority's general manager (public health department) SP Singh said, ""While overall air quality in Noida is better than last year, in two sectors — 116 and 62 — AQI is particularly hazardous. Dumpers carrying sand, most of them uncovered, from Yamuna pass through these sectors throughout the day. Some of the sand falls on the road. On Thursday, we have written to the RTO to take action on such violators.""
Singh added the Authority was in the process to purchase 20-25 water sprinklers along with a hybrid smog gun to aid pollution control measures.
Meanwhile, the health department has seen a 50% increase in patients with respiratory issues, a large number of them young adults.
""There's a rise in viral infections with symptoms like sore throat, fever, and prolonged, intractable cough that isn't responding to standard medications. The combination of high levels of particulate pollution (like PM2.5) from crop burning, traffic, and industrial emissions, along with colder, drier weather, is the primary cause of these respiratory issues,"" Dr Ankit Bhatia, a senior consultant (pulmonology) at Vaishali's Max Super Speciality Hospital, said."

BSIP director Prof Mahesh G Thakkar said that science has always been the driving force for the development of society. India has a rich legacy of scientific innovation, with groundbreaking contributions like the concept of zero and advancements in trigonometry, pioneered by great scholars such as Aryabhata.
Further, he added that IISF-2024 is a powerful platform for professionals and scientists to display and exchange their ideas with the world. Science should not be confined to laboratories but should be accessible and understandable to all people.
He added that science has always played a crucial role in combating serious issues regarding health, agriculture, climate change, natural calamities, etc., and thus, the science festival always aims to bridge the gap between science and policymakers. Moreover, the exchange and collaboration of innovative ideas to face global challenges, along with the fusion of science and art through exhibitions and expos, are also integral parts of the IISF-2024."

As the deteriorating air quality poses health threats to not just young children, elderly people and expecting mothers, but to healthy adults as well; and everyone can be seen scouting for solutions. Thus one can only work towards a solution where the AQI levels dip down from very poor to poor and then finally good so that people can breathe.
Lower AQI means fewer pollutants in the air. Even as it gives immediate relief to people from incessant eye burning and laboured breathing, from an environmental perspective, lower AQI promotes biodiversity for both plants and animals because they get a healthy environment to grow. Less polluted air results in less polluted water and less polluted soil. This leads to an enhanced ecosystem health even as reduced greenhouse gases result in decreased acid rains and reduced global warming. These conditions will have a positive impact on plant-animal growth. For humans, it results in reduced respiratory and cardiovascular issues. Clean air helps to get rid of chronic pollution in urban areas and promotes overall wellness. It also promotes social benefits in terms of lower healthcare costs and improved worker productivity.

As a contributing author of the research paper on ‘Pond degradation and wildlife preservation: A Geographical Analysis,’ published in African Journal of Biological Sciences, my colleagues and I explored the explored on Ponds and it’s ecosystem. The research focuses on how ‘Ponds are essential components of ecosystems worldwide, maintaining ecological balance and biodiversity. However, the many species that depend on these vital water supplies are now in risk due to their degradation brought on by increased human activity and environmental changes. In Ahmadabad, Gujarat, this study intends to assess the geophysical characteristics, ascertain farmers' attitudes towards encouraging wildlife activity in 60 dairy farm ponds, and investigate the relationship between habitat and landscape features and bird populations. A five-meter-wide section of the riverbank and the meadows, hayfields, and fallows that encircled these small, round ponds with muddy or stony margins were included in the observation. Through the recording of 1,962 birds from 45 different species, the study discovered correlations between landscape features and bird abundance.’


My research on ‘Smart Solutions For Environmental Sustainability And Climate Changes’ highlights innovative approaches to sustainable living that mitigate pollution. It states how ‘By utilising technology, data, and innovation, smart solutions play a crucial role in tackling the interconnected problems of climate change and environmental sustainability. In order to build cities that are socially inclusive, economically successful, robust to the effects of climate change, and environmentally benign, this research study examines sustainable urban planning as a crucial activity. The study highlights the necessity of international cooperation to effectively address global environmental concerns and ends with actionable recommendations based on research findings.
So, to keep the AQI under control preventive measures must be undertaken to regulate industrial emission, encourage clean energy resources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, improve public transport, encourage plantation, promote three R policy, reduce, reuse, recycle, implement effective waste segregation and reduce open burning of waste. Public awareness through different digital platforms will also play a key role in ensuring that we create a planet that is breathable for us and can be used by future generations too.

Stop Ignoring The AQI Index: Long Exposure To Polluted Air Can Increase Your Risk Of Heart Attack"
458,Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/etimes/trending/are-planes-polluting-the-sky-and-could-airships-be-the-solution/articleshow/115088875.cms,Are planes polluting the sky and could airships be the solution?,"Nov 8, 2024, 19:18 IST","As climate change accelerates, melting ice caps, vanishing wildlife, and extreme weather events that were once rare now regularly fill weekly forecasts. This stark reality has spurred scientists, governments, engineers, activists, and all those invested in Earth’s future to seek green alternatives to fossil fuels. Amid these efforts, the aviation industry faces rising scrutiny for its significant carbon emissions, which accounted for 2% of global energy-related CO2 emissions in 2022, approximately 80% of pre-pandemic levels. And although measures are being taken to develop sustainable jet fuels or even fully electrified alternatives, these metal airplanes require too much energy.

As an alternative to this problem, airships are being seen as a good option. Airships are a thing of the past and were rejected due to the rapid development in the airplanes. So today, airships find their use only for aerial observation by scientists and militaries, and in the tourism industry. Airships, which are lighter-than-air aircraft, gain lift by using gas with a density lower than that of atmospheric air. While earlier the airships used hydrogen, but due to the inflammatory nature of the gas, helium has replaced it.
While helium is non-combustible, it is also scarce on Earth, with 1 cubic meter, the amount of gas required to lift 1 kilogram of weight, costs roughly $35. Another challenge faced by the airships is buoyancy. Cargo vehicles need to compensate for the weight changes it will experience, when the cargo is picked or dropped. As per experts, the problem can be solved easily by using ballasts or adding weights to regulate stability. A 200-meter-long “flying crane” helium airship called LCA60T, has been designed by a French company Flying Whales. The crane is capable of moving rocket sections and powerline towers; transporting logs from forests to sawmills; and carrying heavy equipment like turbine blades and prefabricated hospitals to remote areas, as per the company’s CEO.

""Meteorological conditions are likely to be extremely unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants. The air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor' category from Friday to Sunday,"" stated the air quality early warning system.
On Thursday, both PM2.5 and PM10 levels were substantially above the permissible limits due pollutants from local sources, including vehicular emissions and dust. The PM2.5 level was highest in Sector 51 at 346 µg/m³, followed by Vikas Sadan (328 µg/m³), Gwal Pahari (365 µg/m³), and Teri Gram (210 µg/m³), CPCB data indicated. PM10 levels were also highest in Sector 51 (302 µg/m³), followed by Gwal Pahari (298 µg/m³) and Teri Gram (254 µg/m³). Vikas Sadan station didn't record its PM10 levels.

According to CPCB, the annual average permissible limits for PM2.5 and PM10 are 60 µg/m³ and 100 µg/m³, respectively.
One of the major contributors to pushing these levels up is stubble burning. The state has recorded 888 cases of stubble burning this year so far. It was 1,579 during the same period last year and 2,576 in 2022. Meanwhile, as per the decision support system for air quality management in Delhi, since Oct 31, the daily contribution of stubble burning mostly remained above 20% in Delhi's PM2.5. The highest single-day share of stubble burning was 35.2% on Nov 1 this season.
In Delhi, the air quality index was 377 on Thursday, making this the ninth consecutive day that the capital breathed in ‘very poor' air. Twelve stations saw AQI in the ‘severe' range throughout the day.
Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) data shows that Delhi's AQI was hovering above 350 for the fifth straight day. With no significant change expected in meteorological conditions, respite from toxic air is unlikely over the next few days. Wazirpur was the most polluted with an AQI of 445, followed by Anand Vihar and Jahangirpuri at 438 each at 6pm.
Moreover, health experts cautioned that patients with respiratory or medical conditions are at a higher risk of being affected by deteriorating air quality. Dr Arvind Kumar, chairperson of Institute of Chest Surgery, Chest Onco Surgery and Lung Transplantation at Gurgaon's Medanta Hospital, said, ""The impact of air pollution on future generations is going to be significant. A child exposed to high levels of pollution may inhale the equivalent of 10 cigarettes from their very first day on earth. Encouraging preventive measures such as wearing face masks and limiting outdoor activities during peak pollution periods is essential.""
The doctor added that: ""Public awareness is equally important, especially in rural areas where knowledge about lung health protection remains limited and there is a myth that rural areas are less polluted. Additionally, a focused national effort to control air pollution is vital for the health of the country's residents. While we have laws, we need to implement them strictly."""

The air quality index (AQI) in Loni reached 406, placing it in the severe category, followed by Vasundhara recording 344 (very poor), Sanjay Nagar at 289 (poor), and Indirapuram at 254 (poor).
Loni's spike in air quality is attributed to industrial activity, vehicular emissions, and construction. Weather conditions, such as slow wind speed, also contributed to the problem. The area's high population density also leads to heavy traffic congestion, with vehicles emitting pollutants like carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter.
Vikas Mishra, regional officer of the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) in Ghaziabad, said the spike in air quality is due to meteorological factors. He stated that the UPPCB is actively enforcing the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) to mitigate pollution.
Neighbouring Noida and Greater Noida also experienced a slight deterioration in air quality on Thursday, attributed to unfavourable weather conditions and reduced wind speed. Noida's AQI rose from 265 to 278, while Greater Noida's increased from 264 to 288, both remaining in the poor category. Ghaziabad's overall air quality worsened from poor (281) to very poor (316).

Wazirpur was the most polluted with an AQI of 445, followed by Anand Vihar and Jahangirpuri at 438 each at 6pm.
""Mainly smog conditions with predominant surface wind from variable directions with wind speed reaching 4–8 kmph prevailed during the daytime and calm winds during the night,"" India Meteorological Department said in its bulletin on Thursday evening.
Winds below 4 kmph are mostly calm as they are unable to disperse pollutants, while winds of 4-8 kmph are considered light. ""Though the winds were variable, upper-level winds were mostly north-westerly, meaning smoke was transported from stubble burning sites to Delhi. However, wind speed dropped to zero during the nighttime and it hampered the process of dispersion of pollutants,"" said an official.

The official added that no improvement in air quality is expected for the next few days as similar weather conditions are likely to prevail. No western disturbance is expected to impact the region in the next few days, either.
The 'very poor' category air forecast came from the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi too.
The share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 was around 23% on Wednesday as against 20.3% a day earlier, according to the Decision Support System, which estimates the contribution of farm fires to pollution.
IMD said shallow fog was reported at Safdarjung as visibility dropped to 800 metres from 7am to 9am. It later improved to 1,500 metres. The lowest visibility at Palam was 1000 metres from 7.30am to 9am.
The maximum temperature was recorded at 31.7 degrees Celsius, two notches above normal. The minimum stood at 18, four degrees above normal.
Pitampura was the warmest station as the minimum temperature rose to 21.4 degrees Celsius there, which was seven degrees above normal.
IMD has predicted that smog or shallow fog in the next four days during the night or early morning.
Meanwhile, in NCR, Gurgaon's air deteriorated to the ‘very poor' category due to low wind speed on Thursday and the AQI stood at 302, up from Wednesday's 293. The Sector 51 station recorded the highest AQI at 368.

The air pollution in Bhopal was not only the highest among major MP cities, including Indore, Gwalior, and Jabalpur, but also around 125 AQI more than Diwali. The air quality index of Bhopal, or air pollution, is on a constant rise since Diwali.
Experts pointed out that air pollution increases during this time of the year not only due to firecrackers but also due to other factors. Bonfires during winters lead to air pollution. Pollution levels decrease during rains but increase afterwards due to damaged roads and other activities, and the burning of bonfires makes it worse.
Experts also noted that apart from local factors like people burning tyres and plastic during cold nights, which lead to increased pollution levels, weather also plays a role in air quality.

Meteorological department officials said that during this time of the year, winds from Punjab and Delhi blow over the state, which could cause the air quality index of MP cities to increase by up to 20 per cent. The second reason is that air pollutants come closer when the temperature falls. From the mid-troposphere, they come to the low troposphere, leading to an increase in pollution levels.
Showers do wonders for air quality. The reason why air pollution decreases during rains, experts pointed out, is that dust becomes heavy in showers and does not fly in the air. Vehicular pollution also decreases as tyres do not lead to the flying of pollutants and dust in the air, as it settles on the ground. This is why pollution levels decrease during rains.
Officials said that apart from the damaged roads, flying dust from vehicles and an increase in construction activities after showers lead to an increase in pollution levels.
Air quality is measured by taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), RSPM10, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful to health and causes severe lung diseases. PM10 is due to dust and construction, including the building of roads, while PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity, and climatic conditions."

Farmers will now face fines ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 30,000, depending on their land size. This measure follows Haryana's chief minister's plea to farmers to cease the practice and utilize government-provided equipment for sustainable stubble management.
NEW DELHI: The central government on Thursday announced an amendment to the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Rules of 2023, focusing on the imposition, collection, and utilisation of environmental compensation for stubble burning.
Under the new rules, farmers will be required to pay an environmental compensation based on the size of their land. Those with land less than two acres will pay Rs 5,000, farmers with land between two to five acres will be fined Rs 10,000, and those with land exceeding five acres will face a penalty of Rs 30,000.
The amendment seeks to standardise the penalty structure, taking into account the varying land sizes and aims to enforce stricter measures to curb stubble burning, a major contributor to the rising pollution levels in Delhi and surrounding areas.
With the Air Quality Index (AQI) surpassing 400, this move comes as part of efforts to address the escalating pollution crisis, Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini urged farmers to avoid stubble burning, stressing the health hazards and promoting government-subsidised machinery to manage stubble more sustainably."

Aiming for it a panel discussion involving various stakeholders from Pakistan and India, who joined in hybrid mode as policy makers, researchers, farmers representatives, and civil society groups came together to understand different perspectives to provide practical and easily implementable solutions apart from facilitate a comprehensive dialogue on the challenges and pathways forward while ensuring that the voices of farmers from both Pakistan and India are actively heard and exchanged.

The event was organized by Economic and social commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), South Asia network on the SDGs (SANS) and Sustainable development policy institute (SDPI).
Three activists from Kheti Virasat Mission Umendra Dutt, Karan Singh and Rupsi Garg participated in the discussions and raised various issues.
It was felt as like India, the farmers in Pakistan too want the governments to take responsibility of crop residue management, look for public health issues and the governments want farmers to come to fore in not burning stubble and indulging into penal action.
“We found it to a much needed effort as farmers from across the borders should know problems of each other. We also need to negotiating table to look for solutions for common problem. Even as the solutions could be taken at the government levels, which presently are not on good terms but at least we should come forward and discuss the issues. We put our viewpoints which was appreciated”, said Umendra Dutt from Kheti Virasat Mission, who participated in the discussion.
It was felt that various governments have introduced incentives as well as penal provisions for crop residue burning, however, the burning continues, which affects the health of farmers and people in rural and urban areas where smoke travels, contributes to climate change with the emission of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) and affects agricultural production and food security by deteriorating soil health.
Moreover, in the Indo-Gangetic plain region, seasonal crop residue burning increases the concentration of particulate matter and black carbon in the air which adversely affects glaciers in the Himalayas.
Addressing emissions from open burning requires a holistic approach involving the adoption of sustainable farming practices and the utilization of technological innovations.
The panelists dwelled upon how policy can be made more pragmatic, easily implementable, and inclusive. What actions are required for effective utilization of mechanized solutions for small landholding farmers, who cannot afford the finance to purchase large and costly machines.
What collaborative efforts are necessary to share best practices and experiences to ensure a balanced outcome in economic sustainability and food security and what roles can think tanks, development partners, and other stakeholders play."

With weather conditions continually influencing air quality, the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) bulletin reports that surface winds in Delhi are from variable directions, with smog and shallow fog expected in the morning on Thursday.
""The predominant surface wind in Delhi on Wednesday came from variable directions at a speed of 04-08 km/h. Similar conditions are expected on Thursday morning, with shallow fog and smog likely. The mixing height was 1,900m on Wednesday and is expected to rise to 1,950m on Thursday,"" reads the bulletin from IITM.

The first six days of this month saw fluctuating air quality in these regions.
""Noida experienced 'poor' air quality on four days and 'very poor' on two. Greater Noida recorded 'poor' air quality on five days and 'very poor' on one. Ghaziabad had 'poor' air quality on three days and 'very poor' air quality on the remaining three days,"" said an official from the weather department.
In comparison, during the first six days of Nov last year, Noida recorded 'poor' air quality for three days and 'severe' for three days."

Even though the average AQI has been below 300 (poor) in the city for the past two days, CPCB data has indicated elevated indices at Gwalpahari and Vikas Sadan, with the latter recording the highest AQI of 363. These are amongst 50 pollution hotspots requiring vigilant monitoring and the air quality in both places has been in ‘very poor' category for the past three days.
The city's 24-hour average AQI stood at 293 on Wednesday, following Tuesday's reading of 298. As winter approaches, NCR states and Delhi experience deteriorating air quality conditions, as colder weather tends to trap pollutants in the atmosphere. Last year's end of October saw the region shrouded in toxic air, prompting official advisories to stay indoors.
""Every morning, we wake up to a burning smell. It's becoming increasingly difficult to breathe, and we are worried about our health. We can feel polluted air in our throats and eyes. It's especially hard on children and the elderly,"" said Sushmita Sharma, a resident of Sector 31.
The list of city's pollution hotspots includes Genpact Chowk in Sector 54, sector roads 82 to 93 and 58 to 57, Vikas Sadan parking area, Sector 10 Chowk to Gadoli village, Vatika Chowk, Hero Honda Chowk to Basai, Rajiv Chowk, Sector 37, IMT Manesar and Udyog Vihar 1 to 5. Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) conducted this assessment in preparation for winter pollution peaks. The board directed city agencies to monitor and address pollution at these locations, considering five key factors: road dust, solid waste, traffic congestion, industrial emissions, and construction and demolition waste.

HSPCB's responsibilities include monitoring industrial fuel usage, whilst municipalities oversee generator set regulations. Traffic management falls under police jurisdiction, and MCG oversees C&D waste management processes.
""We have squads who are randomly carrying out raids and inspections. Road dust is a major pollutant in Gurgaon and Faridabad. We have already instructed civic bodies to take adequate measures. We will take stringent action against civic bodies for not following norms in mitigating road dust,"" said Nirmal Kashyap, head of air cell at HSPCB.

The board identified unpaved roads, stretches with traffic, and illegal waste dumping as primary pollution sources. Alongside GRAP enforcement, authorities must implement winter action plans, including water sprinkling, mechanical road sweeping, and infrastructure repairs.
Experts noted that the city's pollution control challenges stem from major highways, local traffic, C&D waste and regional factors like Punjab's pollutants and Thar desert dust. According to Shubhansh Tiwari, research associate at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), year-round efforts by local authorities are essential for effective winter pollution management.
""Local sources like traffic congestion and C&D waste are key reasons for air pollution in Gurgaon. And major hotspots are highways across the city such as NH-8, Dwarka Expressway, and Sohna highway. Long-range transportation of pollutants from Punjab and dust storms in the Thar desert are contributors as well. Local bodies need to work on these issues for the entire year to yield results during winter or peak pollution season,"" said Tiwari."

The GPCB identified an increase in industrial activities and a sharp increase in the use of vehicles as the major contributing factors for increasing levels of air pollution in the four cities. The state govt has prepared a ""Clean Air Action Plan"" for these cities.
D M Thakar, member secretary, GPCB, said, ""The state govt has prepared a Clean Air Action Plan for Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, and Rajkot. Rapid urbanisation and increasing population in Gujarat's urban agglomerations, particularly in Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, and Rajkot, have created immense pressure on urban infrastructure and environmental sustainability. As these cities continue to grow as economic hubs, the state govt recognises that development must be balanced with environmental protection to ensure long-term sustainability.""
He added that as part of the action plan, the state govt is planning research and implementation of a net zero transport plan, and a pilot project in mid-sized cities.

""These projects aim to reduce air pollution, improve public health and promote sustainable urban mobility. So far, the list has over Rs 3,000 crore worth of actionable projects. The state govt is working on a series of corrective measures to improve the air quality,"" he added.
The ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC), GoI, launched the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) in Jan 2019 to reduce air pollution levels in a comprehensive manner across the country. Under NCAP, city-specific air pollution mitigation action plans were required to be developed by all non-attainment cities identified by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The four big cities of Gujarat feature on the list of 122 non-attainment cities (those which did not meet NCAP standards).
Officials said that between 2019-2020 and 2023–2024, the four big cities received a total of Rs 1,085.42 crore in funds. They said that Rs 11,641.99 crore was also used through various state and central schemes to implement the action plan to improve ambient air quality."

Last month, an IIT-Delhi released a study revealing a 15-26% drop in PM2.5 at three pollution-prone clusters in Delhi resulting from tackling dispersed air pollution sources. To evaluate the impact of the programme, 35 portable low-cost sensors (PLCS) had been deployed in the clusters at Jahangirpuri, Rohini and Karol Bagh, all of which already had an existing continuous ambient air quality monitoring station. The evaluation showed that PM2.5 decreased by 26.6% in Jahangirpuri, 15.7% in Rohini and 15.3% in Karol Bagh. The report concluded that targeted interventions could lead to notable air quality improvements in the city.

The civic body maintains it is focused on targeted action to mitigate dust pollution, such as taking up greening of open areas, parks, municipal institutions, roads, etc., and allocating funds for each zone to carry out road patching work. MCD has deployed 52 mechanical road sweepers with capacities of 6.5 cubic metres and 4.5 cubic metres, and these are in operation on around 3,000km of roads of 12 ft width.
""To intensify the cleaning drive and increase work shifts, we decided to procure 18 more road sweeping machines, but our proposal is awaiting clearance of the standing committee, which hasn't yet been formed. To save time, we plan to submit the proposal to the central govt and request funds for the project,"" said the official."

These regions experienced hazardous air quality measurements, creating substantial health concerns for residents.
Dense, hazardous foam was observed drifting on the Yamuna River near Kalindi Kunj, indicating persistent high contamination levels in the waterway.
The Air Quality Index classifications are: '200 and 300' signifies ""poor"", '301 and 400' indicates ""very poor"", '401-450' denotes ""severe"", whilst readings above 450 fall into the ""severe plus"" category.

On Monday, the Supreme Court questioned the Delhi government about violations of the firecracker ban during Diwali celebrations, which was implemented to reduce air pollution in the capital city.
Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih directed the Delhi government to submit an affidavit detailing measures taken to address pollution concerns and enforce the firecracker restrictions within the city.
Noting widespread media reports about the ineffective implementation of the ban, the bench sought an immediate explanation from the Delhi government regarding the poor enforcement of firecracker restrictions.
The court instructed both the Delhi government and the Police Commissioner to submit affidavits outlining their proposed strategies to prevent similar violations in the following year.
Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Archana Pathak Dave informed the court about complete non-compliance with firecracker restrictions during this year's Diwali. She presented data showing a significant increase in air pollution levels, which rose from 10 per cent to 27 per cent on Diwali day."

Environmentalist Vikrant Tongad highlighted the role of meteorological factors, especially wind speed and direction, in influencing air quality. ""Wind speed and direction are crucial in dispersing pollutants. High wind speed disperses pollutants more effectively, spreading them over a wider area,"" he explained. He added that stronger winds also promote vertical mixing, which further dilutes pollutants near ground level.

""This reduces the concentration of harmful particles in a given location, diluting pollutants and improving air quality locally,"" Tongad said.
To address pollution, Noida's Pollution Department issued fines totaling Rs 1.8 lakh to four violators in Sectors 83, 104, 44, and 26 for not adhering to the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). The Noida Authority reported deploying 45 tankers to sprinkle treated sewage plant water over 150 km of roads, 12 mechanical sweepers covering 350 km of roads, and 38 operational anti-smog guns.
Meanwhile, in Delhi, the capital's air quality continued to languish in the ‘very poor' category for the third consecutive day due to lack of strong winds, local pollutants and emissions from harvest stubble burning in the neighbouring states.
The light morning winds in variable directions could only manage a negligible improvement in the air quality.
The AQI on Tuesday, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 383 at noon, which, due to light winds, improved to 375 by 4pm. The average AQI was 373 against 381 a day earlier.

""The sharp rise in PM2.5 particle concentrations is of particular concern, as these particles can penetrate deep into the lungs, exacerbating respiratory issues,"" a KSPCB official said, adding: ""Post Covid-19 pandemic, this is the first time pollution is so high during Deepavali.""
Shanth A Thimmaiah, chairman of KSPCB, said, ""Over the past four days, vehicular movement surged, especially on Nov 3 (Sunday). This increase led to a rise in ground-level pollutant concentration. With limited atmospheric buoyancy, these particles are likely to remain at ground level for an extended period.""
Residents across the city said even ""green"" crackers were contributing to the dense smoke. ""We were told green crackers were less polluting, but they don't seem to be any different,"" said Ravi Kumar, a resident of Kasturinagar.

NEW DELHI: Toxic smog hung over the city on Monday and more stations recorded ‘severe’ air quality, even though the overall Air Quality Index of the capital remained in the upper levels of the ‘very poor’ zone. The smog that had formed in the morning persisted through the day due to calm wind conditions and pollution kept soaring as the day passed.
The city’s average AQI was 373 at noon and worsened to 380 by 3pm and 386 by 6pm. For Delhiites, it was the familiar November air nightmare all over again with many complaining of itchy eyes, mild headaches and difficulty in breathing as pollution levels kept soaring, with a possible spike in NO2 and ozone, experts said.

During the morning hours, a total of eight city areas were in the ""severe"" category, with Anand Vihar, with an AQI of 425, being the most polluted, followed by Vivek Vihar at 424.

By late afternoon, the number of stations reporting ‘severe’ air had risen to 11, and to 16 , by 7pm. At 7 pm, Anand Vihar was the most polluted area of the city with an AQI of 442, followed by 435 at East Delhi's Vivek Vihar. Other polluted areas included Alipur, Nehru Nagar in South Delhi, Sector-8 of Dwarka, Bawana, Jahangirpuri, and Wazirpur, among others.
The city’s average AQI, on a scale of 0 to 500, was 381 on Monday against 382 a day earlier. The PM2.5 level oscillated between 171.8 to 180.7 micrograms per cubic metre on Monday, against the national safe standard of 60 units and WHO’s 15 units for 24 hours.

“The hazy weather is indeed smog as many areas were under severe or very poor levels. Tiny pollutants such as PM2.5 in the air can settle deep in the lungs, triggering severe health issues. During this time, when pollution levels are heightened, those with pre-existing health conditions are especially vulnerable to respiratory distress,” said Shambhavi Shukla, programme manager, Air Quality Programme, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). Experts also pointed out that a decrease in temperatures and low wind speed are adding to pollution.

“The decreasing temperature and wind speed contribute to pollution stagnation, while lower mixing depth traps pollution near the surface. This pollution mixes with fog, forming smog, which reduces visibility and leads to the grey skies we are seeing now,” said Sunil Dahiya, Founder and Lead Analyst, Envirocatalysts.
According to the air quality early warning system, the city may see very poor air quality for the next two days, after which the AQI may turn severe. It added that low wind speed for the next few days won't favour the dispersion of pollutants. “Meteorological conditions are likely to be extremely unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants... The air quality is likely to be in the very poor category on November 4. The air quality is likely to remain very poor from Nov 5 to 7. Outlook for the subsequent six days: Air quality is likely to be in very poor to severe category,” IITM's air quality early warning system bulletin said.
According to IITM’s Decision Support System (DSS), the contribution of farm fires to the city's PM2.5 levels increased to 19.7% on Monday against 15% a day earlier. Experts, however, also pointed to the role played by smog, sunlight and vehicular emissions in raising pollution levels.
""Ozone forms when nitrogen dioxide (NO2) reacts with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) under sunlight. Fossil fuel combustion releases particulate matter and NO2, while stubble burning raises pollution levels as well, also emitting high VOC levels, fuelling high ozone formation. As temperatures rise during the day, ozone concentrations spike, as shown in monitoring data across Delhi NCR,"" said Dahiya.
The city recorded a maximum temperature of 32.1 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal, against 33.2 degrees Celsius a day earlier. The minimum temperature was recorded at 16.6 degrees C, a notch above normal, against 16.5 degrees C a day earlier. The maximum and minimum temperatures on Tuesday are likely to hover around 32 and 16 degrees Celsius, respectively.
Meanwhile, Gurgaon on Monday recorded its most polluted 24 hours of the season, with air quality dipping to ‘very poor’ as cold weather conditions set in and calm winds couldn’t clear away the toxic haze. Gurgaon’s 24-hour average AQI touched 310 on Monday, a 10% increase from 281 (poor) the day before."

Lucknow: The post-monsoon period this year was comparatively easier on the lungs of Lucknow residents in residential areas as compared to last year.
While PM10 levels declined, PM 2.5 levels slightly increased by 2.1% as compared to post-monsoon season last year. The PM 10 levels in residential areas decreased by 23%. The condition in industrial areas also improved with a 32.9% drop in the air pollution level. Commercial areas, however, witnessed a rise of 17.1% due to a 5.8% increase in vehicles as compared to last year. This was revealed in the assessment of the ambient air quality of Lucknow city, as detailed in the post-monsoon 2024 air monitoring report released by the CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research during its foundation day celebrations on Monday.
The scientific institute monitored nine localities in the city, comprising four residential, four commercial, and one industrial area. The report highlighted that the air in Gomtinagar and Charbagh were the most polluted with the highest PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations.
In residential areas, Gomtinagar recorded the highest PM 2.5 levels at 81.5 micrograms, followed by Vikasnagar (72.4), Indiranagar (64.5), and Aliganj (60.8). In commercial areas, Charbagh recorded the highest PM 2.5 levels at 113.5 micrograms, followed by Chowk (102.2), Aminabad (87.8), and Alambagh (76.3).

Meanwhile, PM 10 concentrations were also recorded as highest in Gomtinagar at 121.6 micrograms, followed by Vikasnagar (110.6), Indiranagar (106.4), and Aliganj (103.9). In commercial areas, the highest PM 10 levels of 176.3 were recorded again in Charbagh, followed by Chowk (155.4), Aminabad (141.7), and Alambagh (139.6) micrograms.
""The post-monsoon air quality survey results were significantly influenced by rain on monitoring days. A decreased concentration level of particle pollution in the city was observed in comparison with pre-monsoon season this year. The monsoon scavenges particles in the atmosphere, and the wet surface controls dust from its resuspension into ambient air,"" said a senior scientist at IITR.

He said that during post-monsoon period, increased atmospheric humidity could lead to agglomeration of particles, making them heavier and causing them to deposit on the ground.
""Activities such as construction, markets, and vehicle movement, are also reduced because of rain. However, the yearly increase in registered vehicular numbers and fuel consumption in the city affects the slightly exceeded air pollution concentration compared to national standards,"" he added.
""In spite of the natural impact of rain, multiple action plans have also been implemented to mitigate the ambient air pollution concentration. The plantation has been enhanced between city roads, which controls the dispersion of vehicular emissions and road dust,"" the scientist said.
The report also highlighted that the city's public transport has shifted to cleaner fuels, with EV buses (146) and CNG buses (55) now operating on city roads. Additionally, other e-vehicles have increased by 51% from the previous year.
""There is also an increase in the number of passengers taking Lucknow Metro. The completion of ongoing construction activities, such as outer ring roads, flyovers, and connecting roads, will also help reduce the traffic influence on air pollution in the city,"" the report said."

Gurgaon's 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) touched 310 on Monday, a 10% increase from 281 (poor) the day before. It is only the second time this season that AQI exceeded 300 this season. The first time it surpassed this mark was post-Diwali, on Nov 1, when AQI fell to 309.
Though pollution was still high, warmer than usual weather and brisk winds had helped clear the air, specifically in the days after Diwali. The city's AQI was 209 (poor) on Nov 2. Air quality is expected to worsen in the coming days, and could fall into the ‘severe' category too, according to the forecast.
""For the next few days, wind speed is likely to be low, just around 4kmph. So, pollutants will remain suspended in the atmosphere and dispersion rate will be slower,"" said Vijay Choudhary, regional officer (Gurgaon-south), Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB).

Granular reading of data by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) also showed that ground-level ozone pollution has gone up to hazardous levels over the past fortnight. This, officials said, is likely because of emissions from firecrackers, vehicles stuck in traffic jams, and power plants.
""Higher ozone pollution is because of more traffic linked to the festival season, power plants operating without installing proper systems, stubble burning and emissions from firecrackers,"" said Manoj Kumar, analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).
Ozone (O3) is formed at ground level when sulphur and nitrogen gases – SOx and NOx emitted in the air – react with sunlight.
Inhaling ozone can cause coughing, shortness of breath, respiratory irritation, and worsen asthma or bronchitis symptoms.
On Nov 4, ozone concentration scaled a high of 146ug/m3 at the Gwalpahari station in the city, 46% higher than the safe limit of 100ug/m3.
Data also showed that between Oct 21 and Nov 4, ozone levels at Gwalpahari exceeded the safe limit for at least 12 days.
At the Sector 51 station, ozone concentrations hit a peak of 106 ug/m3 on Oct 31 and surpassed the safe limit for six days in the past fortnight. Doctors said people with existing respiratory and heart ailments should avoid going outdoors as much as possible.
""Wearing an N95 mask reduces the amount of noxious pollutants inhaled. Using indoor air purifiers also helps and consuming more fluids can help reduce respiratory symptoms. A person should seek medical attention if a respiratory problem persists or if existing conditions worsen,"" said Dr Kuldeep Kumar Grover, head of critical care and pulmonology at CK Birla Hospital in the city.

Lucknow: The cabinet on Monday approved the constitution of the Uttar Pradesh Clean Air Management Authority, a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to execute the Uttar Pradesh Clean Air Management project.
The cabinet approved the DPR (detailed project report) for the period of five years, from 2024-25 to 2029-30. The project will receive a loan of Rs 274,153.04 lakh from the World Bank. Additionally, the project will receive a grant of Rs 1,119 crore through carbon financing.
The cabinet approved the proposal that authorised the Chief Minister to make necessary changes as and when needed in the project.
The project aims to reduce air pollution in the state based on an airshed approach. Under this approach, various programmes will be implemented in different sectors, such as agriculture, transport, industry, animal husbandry, municipal solid waste, and others, to increase the state's capacity to control and manage air pollution.

UP is the first state to adopt airshed-based air quality management. An airshed is an area from which a state draws its air mass. UP's larger airshed is the entire Indo-Gangetic plain. The stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana during winters affects the quality of air in UP and other north Indian states because of the airshed.
There are two types of airsheds: the micro airshed, which exists in the near vicinity of a place, and the macro airshed, which exists over a larger area.
UP has set a target of reducing the PM2.5 level in the air to 45 micrograms per cubic metre in five years. The airshed approach may help achieve this target. PM2.5 is the ultrafine particle in the air, which is less than 2.5 microns in diameter but has severe health effects."

As per the recent data, on Saturday, November 2, Lahore, Pakistan, experienced record-breaking air pollution, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) reaching an alarming 1,900. Lahore topped IQAir's real-time list of the world’s most polluted cities on Sunday.
As per the Swiss air quality rating agency IQAir, the AQI in Lahore surged to 1,067 around 9:30 am, which eventually reached 1,900 later in the day. This number is almost six times higher than the limit defined by the World Health Organization. On the other hand, the concentration of harmful PM2.5 pollutants—fine particulate matter that poses significant health risks—reached a staggering 610, which is over 40 times higher than the World Health Organization's recommended limit of 15 micrograms per cubic meter for a 24-hour period deemed safe for health.

However, the Pakistan government has named India as a reason for this sudden hike in AQI. Senior minister of Punjab Marriyum Aurangzeb during a press conference ascribed the worsening air quality to winds bringing pollution from neighboring India. Secretary for Environment and Climate Change Raja Jahangir Anwar told CNN that there is a need to acknowledge climate diplomacy as a “regional and global issue.""

The government spokesperson also emphasized that it is not blaming India for the spike in AQI, as it is a natural phenomenon. The alarming pollution crisis in Lahore is mainly caused by the burning of crop residues and emissions from industries. And Pakistan faces a pollution crisis every year during October- November.

The government has imposed strict precautionary measures to tackle the situation. As a thick smog has engulfed the city, Marriyum Aurangzeb informed that the schools for primary school children will remain closed and advised parents to ensure that their children wear masks at all times. Further, the government has implemented a ban on three-wheelers, and has suspended construction activities in specific areas. Factories and construction sites that do not adhere to these regulations may face shutdowns. Offices have been asked to allow only 50% of the employees to work from site, to reduce any contributions in the form of vehicle pollution. Government has urged the citizens to stay indoors as much as possible and restrict any outdoor activities if not extremely necessary.

Lahore, Pakistan, recently faced an unprecedented pollution crisis, with air quality levels soaring to record highs. On November 2, the Air Quality Index (AQI) hit an alarming 1,900, placing Lahore at the top of IQAir's list of the world’s most polluted cities. This AQI level is nearly six times the World Health Organization's safety limit, posing severe health risks to residents. Contributing factors include crop burning and industrial emissions, which are common in the region during October and November.
In response, the government has enforced strict measures to protect public health. Primary schools are closed, mask-wearing is encouraged, and restrictions have been placed on construction, factories, and vehicle use."

Balram Kumar, a 24-year-old mechanic who crafts motor starter coils, was one of the few individuals who visited the clinic on Monday. He was experiencing persistent coughing and underwent a chest X-ray before being prescribed medication.
Anjali, a 23-year-old Mangolpuri resident, was another patient who visited the clinic due to breathlessness. She explained that she experiences this issue annually during this season, and the doctors advised her to undergo regular checkups. Anjali mentioned that her mother has respiratory problems, prompting the doctors to emphasise the importance of monitoring her condition. She also shared that she underwent a chest X-ray and was advised to return after a week of medication.
Speaking to TOI, Dr Amit Suri, who oversees both the clinic and the respiratory medicine department, said that the recent festivities and public dismissal of minor symptoms contributed to reduced patient numbers.

A respiratory medicine specialist said that many patients were not aware about the clinic. People continue to visit respiratory OPD and chest departments rather than approaching the specialised clinic directly, he added.
Patient visits at the clinic fell from 25 last week to 15 this week. Operating exclusively on Mondays between 2 pm and 4 pm, this healthcare facility initially began its services in Nov last year and was restarted in mid-Oct 2024.

Dr Suri identified throat irritation, dry cough, eye itching and breathlessness as prevalent complaints amongst patients, particularly in vulnerable individuals affected by smoke conditions. ""We are providing the list of dos and don'ts to the patients after prescribing medicines,"" he said, emphasising the necessity of precautions during this period.
Medical staff assess patient histories to determine whether symptoms are pollution-related or stem from pre-existing conditions. Cases with pre-existing conditions receive referrals to specific OPDs, whilst recent onset symptoms without previous history are attributed to pollution.
Patient counselling remains crucial for minimising pollution exposure and its effects. Healthcare providers offer guidance on proper practices. N95 masks are essential for outdoor activities during this period, as surgical or cloth masks prove insufficient. Air pollution peaks before sunrise and after sunset, with reduced levels during daytime due to higher temperatures, said Dr Suri.
The guidance includes avoiding high-traffic areas and construction sites. Children under 5 and adults over 65 face the highest risks. Individuals with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease experience increased symptom severity. Doctors recommend maintaining prescribed medications, seeking medical attention for worsening symptoms, using indoor air purifiers and obtaining influenza vaccinations.
When questioned about the impact of air pollution on foetuses of expectant mothers, Dr Suri referenced international research indicating higher incidences of stroke, anxiety and depression linked to pollution exposure. Consequently, they assembled a specialised medical team for the clinic, comprising respiratory specialists, psychiatrists, dermatologists and ophthalmologists, as these areas are primarily affected by pollution-related ailments."

With winter setting in, Delhi's air quality is again grabbing headlines as pollution levels hit alarming levels. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) said that over 54,000 vehicles lacking a valid Pollution-under-Control (PuC) certificate have been fined in the last two weeks. Additionally, around 3,900 overage vehicles were impounded across Delhi-NCR by October 31, with authorities targeting vehicles beyond the permissible age limit of 15 years for petrol and 10 years for diesel vehicles to curb emissions.
The GRAP (Graded Response Action Plan), a set of air quality control measures activated annually during winter, has been in force in stages. Stage I of GRAP, triggered by “Poor” air quality (AQI 201-300), was implemented on October 15, followed by Stage II on October 22 as air quality dipped into the “Very Poor” range (AQI 301-400). Delhi’s AQI has since continued to deteriorate, with several areas, including Vivek Vihar and Ashok Vihar, reporting AQI levels above 400, indicating “Severe” air quality (AQI 401-450).

On Monday morning, Delhi’s air quality index spiked alarmingly, with New Moti Bagh recording an AQI of 400, RK Puram and Dwarka Sector 8 at 393, and ITO at 349, all indicating “Very Poor” air quality. In Vivek Vihar and Ashok Vihar, AQI readings climbed to 421 and 409 respectively, entering the “Severe” category, posing serious health risks to residents.
With pollution levels expected to remain high, authorities continue to urge vehicle owners to stay vigilant about their PuC certifications and adhere to the guidelines as stricter measures are rolled out."

It stems from various sources, including vehicles, factories, cooking fuels, and building materials. Particulate matter, especially PM2.5, is a major concern. These microscopic pollutants, produced by burning fossil fuels, wood, and coal, pose significant health risks. Construction sites, roads, and industrial plants contribute to this pollution, as do agriculture, power plants, and households. The widespread nature of these pollutants makes them difficult to avoid.
Indian cities are experiencing a steady decline in air quality. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is rising, with cities like Delhi frequently enveloped in smog. This pollution severely impacts human health, affecting the lungs, heart, skin, and even the brain.
Research has linked air pollution to an increased risk of strokes. When we inhale polluted air, it immediately begins to harm our body. The pollutants can circulate throughout our system, causing damage. They can increase blood viscosity and impair blood vessel function, potentially leading to serious cardiovascular issues like heart disease and stroke.
A study published in the Neurology journal, conducted on a large population over an extended period, found a correlation between poor air quality (particularly high levels of PM2.5 and NO2) and increased incidence of strokes and related deaths. The study also suggested a link between poor air quality and increased cardiovascular complications following a stroke. Even brief exposure to air pollution can be dangerous. It can increase the risk of strokes, along with other heart problems, especially for older people or those with existing health conditions.

While completely eliminating air pollution is challenging, we can take steps to protect ourselves:

Monitor air quality: Regularly check the AQI (Air Quality Index) using weather apps or websites. Be extra cautious when the AQI is high.
Avoid pollution hotspots: On days with poor air quality, stay away from busy roads, industrial areas, and construction sites. For outdoor exercise, choose parks or less congested areas.
Improve indoor air quality: Use HEPA air filters in your home. Consider air purifiers for bedrooms and living areas, especially when outdoor pollution levels are high.
Use protective masks: Wear an N95 mask outdoors during high pollution days. Ensure it fits snugly over your nose and mouth to filter out harmful particles effectively.
Maintain overall health: Eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and avoid smoking. A healthy body is better equipped to combat the effects of air pollution.
By following these steps, we can enhance our resilience against the harmful effects of air pollution and reduce our risk of related health issues, including stroke.

NEW DELHI: Delhi’s air quality sharply worsened on Sunday as calm winds and low mercury impacted the dispersion of pollutants.
Within 24 hours, the Air Quality Index (AQI) rose from 316 on Saturday to 382, placing it in the higher end of the ‘very poor’ category. This was the worst AQI in over nine months. A higher AQI than this was last recorded at 392 on Jan 31, shows Central Pollution Control Board data.
The highest AQI in Oct was 364 in the ‘very poor’ category on Oct 23. The air quality is likely to hover within the ‘very poor’ category till Wednesday.
IMD has predicted that mist or smog conditions during the early hours of Monday to Wednesday. Experts said the wind direction has been changing from north-westerly to southeasterly on Sunday, and wind speed dropped to zero during the transition phase. Even the night temperature, which mostly remained at least 3-4 degrees above normal in Oct, has now started dipping in November. On Sunday, the city recorded the season’s lowest minimum temperature at 16.5 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal. It was a dip of around four degrees as the minimum temperature settled at 21.1 degrees Celsius on October 31.

“As the wind direction is changing to south-easterly, winds turned calm during the daytime, causing accumulation of pollutants. Variable winds blew in the city in the last 24 hours, but south-easterly winds are expected to prevail on Monday and Tuesday. Though south-easterly winds are unfavourable for the transport of emissions from stubble burning to Delhi, local winds are expected to be calm during the night and light during the daytime. Since local winds will not pick up in the next two days, it is likely to impact the air quality,” Mahesh Palawat, vice-chairman of Skymet Meteorology, said.

As the winds turned calm during the daytime, the AQI spiked from 366 at 8 am to 382 at 4 pm based on the average calculated by CPCB of 39 stations out of a total of 40. The AQI reading surpassed 400 at 14 stations, placing them in the ‘severe’ category. This included Anand Vihar, the most polluted with an AQI of 436, followed by Nehru Nagar at 430 and Punjabi Bagh at 425.
“Meteorological conditions are likely to be extremely unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants,” the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi (EWS) said on Sunday. The EWS added that the air quality is likely to remain in the very poor range till Wednesday, but it is forecast to stay in the ‘very poor’ to ‘severe’ category during the subsequent six days from November 6 onwards.
The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 was 14.96% on Saturday, according to the Decision Support System. However, as southeasterly winds are likely to blow in the city, the contribution of stubble burning is expected to decrease. Satellites detected 351 residue burning events on Sunday. Of these, 216 were in Punjab, 19 in Haryana, 16 in UP, 36 in Rajasthan, and 67 in MP, according to satellite data compiled by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute."

A detailed proposal for their permanent engagement will also be sent for approval to lieutenant governor VK Saxena within a week, she said at a press conference.
The announcements come a day after the LG wrote to Atishi, saying that despite his order to immediately reappoint the civil defence volunteers (CDV), he was yet to get a proposal in this regard. ""Of course, you and your party leaders may continue to do politics of taking credit for their reinstatement, but any more delay in the welfare of these economically weaker and helpless people is not right in any way,"" Saxena said in his letter.
Around 10,000 CDVs working as marshals on public buses in Delhi were removed from their jobs in Nov last year after objections were raised by the revenue and finance departments.

At the press meet, the chief minister said that in a meeting last week, the CDVs were already assigned for implementation of various anti-pollution measures undertaken by different agencies. ""Their call out will begin in the next 2-4 days,"" she said.
Atishi slammed BJP, saying that it should stop its ""dirty politics"" over the issue. She claimed the party would make efforts to block AAP govt's proposal to the LG for the permanent engagement of CDVs. ""I want to ask
BJP leaders to stop their dirty politics. First, their salaries were stopped in April last year and they were removed in Oct 2023 due to BJP's conspiracy,"" she said. AAP functionaries extended full support to the CDVs after their salaries were stopped, she claimed.
Hitting back, Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said that it was strange that chief minister was so agitated by ""our demand to follow the LG's directive to reinstate the civil defence volunteers. She is citing examples from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, yet fails to explain why her govt hasn't reinstated them,"" he said. ""Atishi ji... I am coming to your official residence on Nov 4 with functionaries and workers to demand the reinstatement,"" he said."

“The high level of activities, particularly traffic and crowded markets, was observed until late at night, in addition to the burning of firecrackers, resulting in more emissions of air pollutants.

Less bone minerals makes the bone more fragile. Nicotine in the cigarette slows down the production of bone forming cells that is osteoblasts so that they make less bone. Smoking decreases the absorption of calcium from the diet. Smoking also causes an imbalance in mechanism of bone turnover leading to decreased bone mass density or osteoporosis.
Smoking decreases blood supply for the fractured bone and increases time for bone healing. Bone healing requires adequate blood flow. Smoking causes decreased blood supply. Smoking increases time for ossification and remodeling following fractures, so the bone healing slows down. Air pollutant matters matter smaller than 2.5 micrometer causes decreased density and quality of bone.
Inhaling pollutant could lead to bone mass loss through oxidative stress and inflammation caused by air pollutant. Air pollutant decreases calcium absorption due to heavy intake of pollutant. Human body undergoes tremendous stress. It reduces calcium absorption thereby osteoporosis. Passive smokers are also at risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis.
Post smoking, harmful chemicals will spread and linger in home for 5 hours. Children breathe faster than adults, so they take more harmful chemicals with passive smoking. Children are also more sensitive to smoke than adults because of their bodies are young and are still developing. Healthy cells are attacked by free radicals causing oxidative stress and cell destruction. Antioxidant helps to repair the damaged cells by free radicals.

How air pollution degrades the bone health
Air pollution is also known to add to bone problems such as osteoporosis. If the elderly, who are frequently exposed to toxic airborne substances, are more likely to develop bone disorders. This is possible because air pollution and mineral density are related to the impacts of a mixture of substances. The effects might be noticed in the lumbar spine.
Numerous elements have been implicated in the possible detrimental effects of pollution on bone. In addition to increasing cytokines that activate bone cells (osteoclasts) that lead to bone loss, PM causes systemic inflammation. While some contaminants (such as metal compounds and gasses) serve as endocrine disruptors and impair bone cell function, others can destroy bone cells oxidatively.

5 Simple ways to fix your posture

The production and metabolism of vitamin D, which is essential for the intestinal absorption of calcium, may also be impacted by pollution. Because specific UV radiation wavelengths are required to produce vitamin D in our skin, high pollution levels can limit the quantity of UV light that reaches the planet.
Poorly mineralized bone can result from decreased skin production of vitamin D unless adequate vitamin D intake is obtained through food or supplementation.

The PM2.5 and PM10 levels reached severe levels in all these monitoring zones.
Favourable meteorological conditions and restrictions on bursting firecrackers appear to have facilitated early restoration of ambient air quality.
Maharashtra Pollution Control Board regional officer Hema Deshpande told TOI that the situation is under control this year. ""Swift dispersal and weather conditions did work in our favour. The region is not experiencing significant cold presently, so the air was cleaner,"" she said.

Deshpande indicated the data on noise pollution would be analysed and released after three days of the festival.

air pollution,"" Dr. Anil Goyal, MBBS, MS - General Surgery, MCh - Urology and former IMA President, told IANS.
He noted that air pollution can lead to infections in the windpipe and lungs.
""The presence of particulate matter in the body can cause pneumonia and bronchitis. It can also worsen conditions for people already suffering from asthma and lead to hospitalisation and ICU admissions."" Goyal said, noting that children and patients with hypertension, cardiac diseases, and kidney dialysis are the most vulnerable.
The health expert stated that air pollution is also causing allergies, leading to irritation and watering of the eyes; and throat infections.
""PM2.5 microns can pass through the bloodstream and cause damage to lungs, liver, and kidneys,"" Goyal said.
Increasing levels of air pollution can also have a profound impact on mental health.
Dr Jyoti Kapoor, Founder & Director, Manasthali Wellness told IANS that exposure to PM2.5 and toxic gases can impact mental health.
""This can cause many psychological and emotional problems. Prolonged exposure to air pollution increases stress, anxiety, and depression,"" Kapoor said.
To prevent the range of conditions, Goyal suggested the residents to keep sprinkling water in localities to curb the dust; use air purifiers at home; do not burn garbage; use less of own vehicles, but use state-sponsored buses, and metros to travel.
He also recommended the vulnerable population use masks, and go for morning walks only after sunrise; not indulge in heavy exercise
Avoiding non-vegetarian diets, and spicy and fatty foods can also aid in digestion and keep people healthy during high pollution levels. Goyal said while advising people to take more water, fresh fruits, green vegetables, and millet."

Experts say a cleaner than usual Diwali, and the day after Diwali, isn’t evidence of measures being taken to curb winter air pollution. Firecrackers were lit up abundantly in the days leading to the festival and were pervasive till late into the night on Thursday.
Granular data of pollutants showed just how toxic the air was.
Levels of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 – tiny pollutants that are inhaled and can get absorbed into the bloodstream – hit a high of 500ug/m3 – over ten times the permissible safe limit of 60ug/m3 in India – at the Sector 51 air quality monitoring station around 2am on Friday.
Similarly, PM10 pollutants reached 494ug/m3 around the same time, almost five times higher than the cap of 100ug/m3 considered safe by CPCB.

The cracker bursting went well beyond the UT administration’s stipulated window.
“There was improvement in the AQI after 4-5am on Nov 1 and it further improved due to dissipation of the air. By around 1 pm, the air quality was moderate in several locations in the city,” said a UT official.
Trend of air quality during a normal day was satisfactory or moderate at all the stations; even on the day of Diwali it was observed to be satisfactory up to 6 pm. However, after 8 pm, air quality worsened and around 10 pm it was observed to be severe in Sector 53, Sec 22 and Sector 25.
“Due to climatic conditions and stubble burning, air quality was already deteriorating and sometimes came under very poor category. It is very good to see that before Diwali, there was very less bursting of firecrackers. However, on Diwali day there was a lot of bursting of firecrackers which clearly reflected in the air quality data monitored by CPCC in various areas of Chandigarh,” said a UT official."

• First Diwali is celebrated during the winter months and in the cold season, cold weather, often there is an aggravation of pre-existing respiratory conditions like COPD, asthma, bronchitis.
• During the Diwali season, often the air pollution levels are pretty high because of the widespread festivities and lighting of candles, incense and the up burning, and most notably the firecracker use of fire cracker, they emanate large amount of smoke, fumes and noxious particles into the air, causing deterioration of air quality.

• Diwali is celebrated in the month of October, November every year, and this is the peak influenza season in India, along with that many other viruses and bacteria circulating during this time and the festivities often there is overcrowding, mingling of friends, families, and this causes the splurge in influenza cases and other viral respiratory infection cases in the community.
This increase in the infections often causes exacerbation of the pre-existing condition in the vulnerable population, like those with lung diseases, heart, diabetics and other chronic conditions such as liver and kidney disease. This can cause significant increase in morbidity and mortality.

To safeguarding their respiratory health and to ensuring that it is not affected, patients suffering from lung diseases should take extra precautions during this season.
8 essential tips for a happy and safe Diwali

For those patients, especially when firework display or events are held and firecrackers are used, it is recommended to follow some of the common suggestions listed below.
1. Staying indoors as much as possible to minimize exposure to smoke and pollutants

While high-decibel firecrackers have serious health impacts due to high impulses, both air pollution and noise have a far-reaching impact on the biodiversity.
""We are at a juncture of climate change and air pollution when it is time we completely shun fireworks. Fireworks, in whatever form, cause air pollution at a time in the season when its impacts are irreversible and long-standing. It is heartening that a lot of students now celebrate the festival of light without fireworks,"" said WBPCB chairman Kalyan Rudra.
At a meeting with police and citizens, Rudra explained that fireworks contain heavy metals, like lead, titanium, strontium and copper, which are highly toxic to humans and wildlife. ""During the 2019 Diwali, PM10 count often exceeded 900 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3), which was horrific. The air was laden with heavy metals of all kinds, and inhalation of such was extremely hazardous,"" he said.
There is an overarching emphasis on the noise level of Diwali because of its immediate impact on our sensory perception. The impacts, such as temporary hearing impairment or a heart attack, are severe.

Fireworks can cause extensive air pollution in a short amount of time, leaving harmful chemicals, smoke and metal particles in the air for days. They can also lead to water contamination and acid rain. The green light produced in fireworks displays comes from barium, which is radioactive and poisonous. The blue colour produced from copper causes irritation in the respiratory tract.
Fireworks can disturb wildlife, causing them to flee, abandon their nests or fly into obstacles. They can also cause mammals to panic and invertebrates to alter their behaviour. Fireworks can start wildfires that destroy habitats. They can also leave behind litter that can choke wildlife or be toxic if ingested. The plastic parts of fireworks can decompose into microplastics.
Some ways to reduce the impact of fireworks on biodiversity include using safer alternatives, such as eco-friendly fireworks, drones or laser-based light shows, instead of traditional fireworks. Banning fireworks during sensitive periods, such as when wildlife is migrating or mating, can also help."

Most of these are from families with kids and senior citizens. “Just a few years ago, most families stayed home for Diwali celebrations, but with the rising pollution, we’ve seen a growing number of families, especially those with young children and elderly members making Corbett their Diwali escape. It’s a quick, easy drive,” shares Avni Tripathi, director, Aahana Resorts, Jim Corbett. “We have started receiving more queries from Delhi for the Diwali weekend and already have confirmed around 20 rooms for this period.

Choking pollution is what one finds in big cities.
But for all of 2023 and most of this year, a very small town in the foothills has been more polluted than Delhi and any other city in the plains. Not in the capital’s neighbouring Himayalan retreats but in another part of the country — Meghalaya.

So, what’s choking Byrnihat? Spread across the Meghalaya-Assam border, the town in Ri Bhoi district on the Meghalaya side, is an industrial area, home to clusters of small-scale units producing ferroalloys, tyres and tubes, cement and polythene items. The close proximity in which these industries operate results in Byrnihat’s noxious pollution levels.
“Since it’s on the border of two states, it witnesses huge interstate truck movement. As a result, the emission levels are high,” says Sunil Dahiya, analyst at Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). The town with a large migrant population working in its industries has also been witnessing hectic construction activity, adding a compounding factor to its polluting mix.

Byrnihat is also representative of India’s under-studied and under-attended air pollution problem in cities beyond Delhi, especially tiers II and III. In the 2023 overall pollution index, Delhi, in fact, was at eighth spot. Begusarai in Bihar was second after Byrnihat. Ravi Kant Anand, assistant professor at Begusarai’s GD College, who moved to the town in 2017 from Munger, says, “It’s been a disgusting experience. It’s often stifling and one experiences acute irritation in the eyes.”

Other places more polluted than the capital in 2023, were all small cities, and among them, only Greater Noida is in the NCR. For Byrnihat, the trend has continued into 2024, with the northeast town consistently ranking number one.
Anirban Banerjee, a senior associate working in the air quality team at Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP), says pollution in Byrnihat may also be attributed to its hilly terrain, which traps pollutants in the region. “However, further studies are required to determine the exact cause,” he adds.
While the Central Pollution Control Board has repeatedly flagged high atmospheric pollution levels at Byrnihat, a joint monitoring system by the Assam and Meghalaya govts is the need of the hour but neither has done so.
Many in the Byrnihat though, have learnt to live with the pollution — it’s a lesser evil than lack of income. Take for example, Mehbooba Khatoon, who runs a budget eatery along the main road in Byrnihat. “Pollution hardly matters for us. It is because of the polluting industries that we are earning our bread and butter. So many of these industrial workers are our customers,” she explains.
The workers, too, are not complaining. Their salaries may be paltry, but they at least arrive on time. A significant section of the workers in the industries here come from the flood-ravaged districts of lower Assam, such as Barpeta, Dhubri, and Kamrup, their ancestral lands having been lost to the relentless erosion of the mighty Brahmaputra.
“While the women workers get around Rs 200 per day, the men get around Rs 350 per day. Pollution affects health, but the management provides masks inside the plants. Owing to the lack of jobs in our villages, people agree to work here,” says Imran Hussain, a worker in a coke plant.
Whose Pollution Is It Anyway?
Travelling from Guwahati to Shillong, capital cities of the states of Assam and Meghalaya respectively, the verdant scenery gives way to smoke-belching industries as one approaches Byrnihat, designated as a non-attainment area under the National Clean Air Programme (a city where the air quality didn’t meet the national ambient standards).
While there are industries on both sides of the border, a centrally initiated Export Promotion Industrial Park (EPIP) was set up on the Meghalaya side in 1996. There are 21 industries operating from EPIP at present, six of which have come up in the past two years. Industries need a clearance from the state pollution control boards to operate.
The Meghalaya State Pollution Control Board (MSPCB) this year served closure notices to half a dozen ferroalloy manufacturing units in Byrnihat for failure to adhere to stipulated environmental pollution norms and egregious deficiencies in the implementation of pollution mitigation mechanisms. The gaps included the absence of an appropriately calibrated meter to measure local pollution that industrial units must mandatorily set up.
Ri Bhoi deputy commissioner Abhilash Baranwal claimed the Meghalaya part of Byrnihat’s industrial area does not contain any ‘red category’ (most polluting) industries. Officials on the Meghalaya side claimed the number of units is higher on the Assam side. TOI reached the Assam PCB for the number of polluting industries on their side of the border but was told the data was not available.
“Pollution by industries can’t be denied, but dust and vehicular pollution are also factors in Byrnihat. Forest fires on the Meghalaya side are another issue,” said Manoj Saikia, senior scientist at Pollution Control Board, Assam.
Although neither Assam nor Meghalaya is willing to accept complete responsibility, both sides are now advocating for a collaborative effort to identify and curb the pollution. “Supervision of a central agency may be helpful,” Saikia added.
Need For Immediate Action
In Feb, CPCB issued grave warnings on Byrnihat for its air quality index, which often plummets into the ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’ categories, indicating a serious threat to public health. These are the levels Delhi usually sees at the onset of winter when crop residue burning happens in Punjab and Haryana.
“The air data analysis of Byrnihat shows that its PM2.5 levels are far exceeding the NAAQS (National Ambient Air Quality Standards) and WHO (World Health Organisation) guidelines,” said Manoj Kumar, an air analyst at CREA.
To help improve ambient air quality in the area, there is “an immediate need for taking necessary preventive and control measures to reduce the emission or pollutants at source”, said a senior CPCB official speaking on condition of anonymity. “CPCB has already issued warnings about the severe pollution in Byrnihat to the state pollution control board.”
According to experts, the two state govts need to implement stringent regulations for industrial operations, improve public transport infrastructure, enforce effective pollution control measures during construction, check forest fires and help raise awareness among people about the urgent need to control air pollution.

As India dresses in its festive best during Diwali and cities light up with lamps and firecrackers, taking care of your health is essential. Nowadays, Diwali has turned into a huge source of air and noise pollution resulting in a number of health hazards. In addition, it has become a huge problem for patients suffering from bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiac disorders, etc.
Health tips for a safe Diwali:
One of the most common health issues during Diwali is burn injuries, which can be prevented by wearing pure cotton clothes as synthetic fabrics catch fire easily. In addition, closed shoes should be worn to avoid any burn injuries of feet.
Candles, diyas, and colourful LED lights during Diwali can prevent a lot of air pollution that leads to irritation of eyes, nose, throat, and skin. It is also advisable to stock up medications like nasal spray and anti-allergics.
Opting for green crackers is better as it causes less pollution and produces a sound less than 125 dB, reducing the chances of hearing loss, headache, anxiety, worsening of hypertension or cardiac diseases, etc.
It is better to stay indoors specially in the evening for those suffering from bronchial asthma, COPD or cardiac disorders, as inhaling the gases emitted from fire crackers can aggravate the symptoms.
Everyone should aim to keeping themselves properly hydrated, and should have a balanced diet rich with green leafy vegetables, lean proteins and fruits.

Tips to keep your eyes safe:
Diwali is also the time when you need to be extra careful about keeping you eyes safe. Here are some safety tips you should keep in mind:
If a splinter gets into the eyes, immediately wash with plenty of clean water. You can also apply ice or cold compress if possible.
Wearing plain spectacles goes a long way in safeguarding your eyes.
Do not cover crackers with glass bottles, tins, boxes, or earthen pots and pans for sound effect or extra impact. They are capable of bursting into tiny pieces and damaging your eyes forever.
Do not go near crackers that have failed to explode, rather try and quickly extinguish any sparks or shouldering bits that you can see, but from a distance.
If you are wearing contact lenses, it is advisable not to watch or burn crackers and fireworks yourself as they may cause irritation.
In case of an eye injury, remember not to rub your eyes or use home remedies like turmeric powder, coconut oil, etc. in the eye or area around it.
Always remember to wash your hands thoroughly with hand wash or soap after making a rangoli or handling fireworks, and before you touch your eyes.

Despite claims by the pollution department and Noida Authority about enforcing GRAP norms, mounds of dirt left in empty lots, or simply dumped at the roadside, and uncovered construction material are a common sight across the city.
On Monday, TOI found half-covered piles of rubble spilling out on to the pavement between Botanical Garden metro station and GIP Mall. Though green drapes have been put up by the contractor appointed by Noida Authority to dismantle the pathway, these are patchy, hardly enough to keep the wind from whipping dust out into the road. People navigating the stretch — many of them seen using handkerchiefs to cover their face — said the dust leaves them choking.
In Sector 37, dry leaves and garbage were found heaped outside a park. It appeared the sanitation workers had swept the spot and left the garbage at the spot, in contravention of the stage 2 of the graded response action plan that requires proper disposal of garbage and dust collected in designated sites or landfills.
An uncovered pile of sand was spotted outside Golf City in Sector 75. With the road in the area not cleaned for a long time, dust flew with each passing vehicle.

Multiple potholes near Sector 51 metro station also kicked up dust in the area.
The dust control and mitigation measures under GRAP Stage 2 require water to be sprinkled and dust suppressants used at least every alternate day, during non-peak hours, on roads to arrest road dust, especially at hotspots, heavy traffic corridors and vulnerable areas.
When approached, Noida Authority's deputy general manager (civil) Vijay Rawal said there is a project to develop 22 kiosks and a parking facility near GIP mall. ""The project was to be completed in five to six months. As the pollution level increased, we stopped the construction work and put green net on the debris. We will sprinkle water and ensure GRAP compliance,"" he said.

The Authority also asserted that its 45 tankers sprinkle treated sewage plant (STP) water across 150 km of roads and 12 mechanical sweeping machines cover 350 km of roads regularly. It said 38 anti-smog guns are currently operational at various sites. But when TOI visited an area near City Centre metro station, it found the anti-smog gun non-functional, and the sidewalks covered with dust and tree leaves. At another spot — a construction site for a mall in Sector 50 — only one anti-smog gun was found operational instead of two.
TOI also noted construction activities at multiple sites in the 7X sectors. The city's construction sites are an outsized contributor to the foul air that doctors warn is making the air hazardous, particularly for children and the elderly.
While GRAP Stage 2, which is currently in force, permits construction and demolition activities, but it requires the local authorities to inspect them to ensure strict enforcement of dust control measures.
UPPCB regional officer (Noida) Utsav Sharma said the pollution department was conducting enforcement drives to ensure compliance with pollution control norms. ""Every day we conduct drives and fine 5-10 violators. We will expedite the drive, especially at construction sites. However, deploying anti-smog guns comes under Noida Authority's purview,"" he said.
Noida's deputy general manager (health) SP Singh said ""we have directed our officials to look into the matter and take action."""

On the eve of World Stroke Day, experts like Dr Sudhir Shah highlight the growing importance of addressing environmental factors, such as air pollution and stress, to prevent this silent killer.
Dr Shah, a senior neurologist who was conferred Padma Shri in 2016 for his contribution to the medical field, said, ""While traditional risk factors remain important, we must also consider the impact of pollution, infection and stress. Studies, such as those conducted by the University of Edinburgh, have linked increased air pollution, particularly PM2.5, to a higher risk of stroke. This is due to the impact of compounds such as carbon monoxide and sulphur dioxide on epithelial cells. These harmful pollutants can trigger inflammation and contribute to conditions like atherosclerosis.""
He added that individuals with a history of viral or bacterial infections may also be more susceptible to stroke. ""Furthermore, the pervasive influence of stress, leading to hypertension and other cardiovascular issues, cannot be overlooked. What we do not see is the impact of prolonged mobile phone use and addictions,"" added Dr Shah.
Dr Shah said that about 70% of stroke cases can be prevented with a balanced diet, balanced lifestyle and preventive medication. ""One must regularly monitor blood pressure and blood sugar levels. Regular medication can prevent complications. There should also be an emphasis on public infrastructure for activities such as light exercises and meditation to reduce stress,"" he said."

After a high-level meeting, which was attended by environment minister Gopal Rai and senior officers of various departments of Delhi govt, chief minister Atishi said the former Civil Defence volunteers would be deployed at about 1,000 pollution check centres to ensure no vehicle is provided with a PUC certificate fraudulently. They will be stationed at state borders to prevent unauthorised vehicles from entering Delhi during the implementation of GRAP III and IV restrictions and will be posted at 13 hotspots and 27 additional locations where pollution levels are high and require monitoring.
""Additionally, these volunteers will support the MCD's inspection teams, which are actively monitoring construction and demolition waste, illegal dumping, open waste burning and the use of diesel generator sets,"" Atishi said.
The chief minister said that Delhi Pollution Control Committee's 33 teams were consistently monitoring dust prevention at construction sites. She added that the Civil Defence volunteers would be assigned to these teams and would also check if the complaints received at ‘Green War Room' were being addressed. ""They will also be deployed to encourage people to use public transportation more frequently,"" she said.

Atishi said the services of these volunteers would be used for four months. ""Their registration will begin within the next week, and they will be deployed on the ground as soon as possible,"" she added.
The chief minister added that Civil Defence volunteers were deployed as bus marshals for the first time in 2017-18. ""In April 2023, central govt hatched a conspiracy to remove these bus marshals and even stopped their salaries. While Delhi govt repeatedly wrote in support of the bus marshals, emphasising their need and role in bus safety, yet, under a planned strategy, the Centre dismissed them from their jobs in Oct 2023,"" Atishi claimed.
Rai said the volunteers were earlier deployed during the ‘Odd-Even scheme' and they played a vital role.
Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva, however, said that the volunteers suffered due to the ""chaotic governance"" of Arvind Kejriwal. ""Kejriwal govt appointed these volunteers as bus marshals without following administrative procedures and made no provisions for their permanent employment. When the matter got stuck in vigilance investigations, it was Kejriwal himself who ordered their dismissal,"" he claimed. ""Atishi was trying to take credit for their reappointment despite having no role,"" he alleged."

As the festival approaches, the brothers—both in their late 40s—pack up with their two labradors, Diesel and Lara, and set off with their bicycles for a one- to two-week retreat in the Uttarakhand hills.
""While Delhi's air becomes nearly unbreathable, here we immerse ourselves in trekking, cycling, yoga, and other healthy pursuits,"" Prateek shared. His brother added, ""It's now unthinkable to stay in Delhi during Diwali, though it's our busiest season businesswise.""
The Wason brothers are not alone in their retreat; rising air pollution levels ahead of Diwali are prompting many NCR residents to escape to Uttarakhand in search of cleaner air. As smog blankets the city, families are increasingly heading to hill towns, often extending their stays. Hotels, which once saw low occupancy during this season, now report rates between 40-60%, reflecting a growing trend of people seeking refuge from the capital's deteriorating air quality.
The trend is seen in popular destinations such as Mussoorie, Nainital, and Kausani, in addition to Dehradun, where numerous residents from northern states, nearing retirement, have even built houses to escape seasonal pollution.

Ajay Duggal, a 55-year-old businessman from Delhi's Paschim Vihar, is among them. He purchased a home in Dehradun to avoid the NCR's Diwali smog. Duggal, along with his wife, son, and daughter-in-law, often retreats to his Sahastradhara residence for the festivities and vacations. ""After celebrating briefly in NCR, many families now prefer to spend Diwali in Uttarakhand, enjoying its proximity and healthier environment,"" he said.

For Gurgaon entrepreneur Arjun R Kohli, Uttarakhand's appeal is undeniable. ""There's no point staying in polluted air when, just 275 km away, Uttarakhand offers so much. You save yourself and feel rejuvenated,"" he said, adding that his stays across the Garhwal region have always been memorable.
Sandeep Sahni, president of the Uttarakhand Hotel and Restaurant Owners Association, told TOI, ""Diwali used to be a ‘nil season,' with most people celebrating at home, and low hotel and homestay occupancy. However, the last five years have seen a shift, particularly post-Covid, as people grow more health-conscious amid rising pollution levels. Now, we're seeing 40-60% occupancy during Diwali."" Sahni noted that his sister, Sumira Khanna, a resident of Delhi's Panchsheel, also prefers Uttarakhand for Diwali.
Ajay Bhatt, who manages a homestay and hotel in Auli and nearby areas, said, ""We often get customers looking to escape air and noise pollution, not just from NCR but also from eastern and southern India."" Bhatt added that due to travel distances, these visitors often stay in Rishikesh, Mussoorie, and the Kumaon side.
In the Kumaon region, bookings mirror this trend. ""Our occupancy is around 40-50%, with last-minute bookings expected post-Diwali,"" said Digvijay Singh, president of the Nainital Hotel and Resort Association.

However, the bench said that the stage-3 curbs will be reimposed if the AQI surpasses 350, and stage-4 if it exceeds 400.
The court also expressed discontent over the delayed compensation for construction workers, who have been adversely affected by the ban on construction activities due to high pollution levels.
The Delhi Chief Secretary was threatened with contempt proceedings after the government paid only Rs 2,000 to each of the 90,000 registered workers, far short of the Rs 8,000 promised to them. The Chief Secretary assured the court that the remaining Rs 6,000 would be disbursed by the following day.

NEW DELHI: The Aam Aadmi Party claimed on Monday that there has been a significant decline in stubble burning in Punjab after the formation of its government in the state. Stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana has been widely cited as a major contributor to the air pollution in Delhi during the post-harvest season, particularly in October and November. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)governments in Delhi and Punjab have been facing flak as pollution levels continued to rise in the national capital.
Addressing a press conference, AAP MLA Dilip Pandey said, ""Due to the meaningful efforts of the Bhagwant Mann government in Punjab, there has been a significant decline in the number of stubble-burning cases in Punjab.""
Citing data of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), Pandey claimed the number of stubble-burning cases in Punjab has come down to 1,866 from almost 8,000 in October 2022.
""According to the data of the central government's IRAI, there were about 8,000 stubble cases in Punjab till this week of October 2022, and as per the latest data of today, the cases have come down to 1,866,"" Pandey said.

He said that the data clearly shows that the AAP government of Punjab has worked positively to resolve this issue, whereas the BJP-ruled Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have just been indulged in blaming, and their contribution to resolution is ""zero.'
The national capital's air quality has plunged into the ""very poor"" category for the past several days, with some areas in the city even recording 'severe' pollution levels.
The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has also heightened vigilance during this period, deploying central teams to monitor stubble burning across key districts in Punjab and Haryana."

Sachdeva further claimed that the foams in the Yamuna reflected its dire state, caused by untreated waste from 18 major and 32 minor drains flowing directly into it. A report estimates that 2 billion litres of untreated water, filled with surfactants and filamentous bacteria, are discharged into the Yamuna daily, he stated.
Sachdeva claimed that these toxic elements in the river also degraded air quality, forcing residents to breathe hazardous air.

The BJP MP from South Delhi, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, also slammed Delhi govt for relaunching the ""Red Light On, Gaadi Off"" campaign. ""Crores of rupees have been spent on such campaigns in the past few years, but the air of Delhi has only gone from bad to worse,"" he added.
Bidhuri said that when Delhi Pollution Control Committee was asked whether this campaign reduced pollution, the answer was that no such scientific study was done. The MP said that instead of such ""publicity stunts"", govt should focus on concrete steps.

Jaipur: Rajasthan State Roadways Transport Corporation (RSRTC) has complied with the new air pollution norms of National Capital Region (NCR) by procuring over 500 buses with Bharat Stage-VI (BS-VI) engine technologies. This means RSRTC will now be able to operate on all the routes to Delhi and NCR and will also be able to run all buses from its five depots – Alwar, Matsyanagar, Tijara, Bharatpur and Loahagarh – that fall under NCR.
""We placed an order for 510 BS VI buses to sort out this issue. As of Oct 15, we have procured 422 buses. All these BS VI buses have been distributed to our 52 depots across the state as per the demand on NCR-bound routes. The rest of the buses will reach us by Oct 31,"" said a senior RSRTC official.
Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR has extended the deadline for BS VI buses to all the state transport units (STUs) to Oct 31. RSRTC will be one of the STUs to make a complete overhaul of its fleet moving to and from NCR.
RSRTC chairperson Shubhra Singh told TOI the corporation has strengthened its NCR fleet through induction of 510 BS VI buses. At the same time, Delhi-Jaipur operations have been increased by inducting ten new AC buses. ""With this, we actually reduced the rate of ticket prices and travel time by increasing operations through the Mumbai-Delhi Expressway (via Dausa),"" said Singh.

With Diwali and the festive season around the corner, RSRTC is keen on increasing services on a number of profitable routes with these new BS VI buses.
""The Jaipur-Delhi route has been revamped because of this new fleet of buses. Now the frequency of buses via the old Delhi route will reduce to 30 minutes from three hours.

Despite ongoing recruitment endeavours over the past five months, the board has been unable to fill 25% of its vacant positions, including 29 assistant environmental engineers, 17 junior environmental engineers and five scientists.
This staffing deficit has severely impeded the HSPCB's ability to effectively combat air pollution, a perennial issue in Haryana, especially during the winters when pollution levels typically surge, even as the board has frequently cited the paucity of personnel as a major hurdle in its environmental protection efforts.
On the other hand, the persistent vacancies have also raised grave concerns about the HSPCB's capacity to fulfill its mandate.

The shortage of assistant and junior environmental engineers, as well as scientists, signifies that critical tasks such as monitoring pollution levels, enforcing regulations and implementing pollution control measures are being compromised.
The situation was brought to light in a petition filed before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) last year, which underscored that over 60% of staff positions at the HSPCB were vacant.

In response to the petition, the HSPCB informed the NGT that recruitment processes for the vacant positions are underway.
However, the magnitude of the recruitment efforts necessitated a request for a three-month period, made in April, to report on the progress of filling these posts.
Despite these efforts, the board has only managed to fill 35% of its vacant positions, leaving 303 out of 481 posts still unoccupied across all 22 districts. The tribunal was hearing a petition by activist Varun Gulati.
Pulled up over its efforts in fighting foul air at various platforms, the pollution control board has often cited lack of manpower as the reason.
""A large number of posts in HSPCB were lying vacant and hence, the issue of filling of the posts arose. Let a fresh report be filed at least one week before the next date of hearing,"" stated the April 10 order issued by an NGT bench comprising Prakash Shrivastava, chairperson, Sudhir Agarwal, judicial magistrate, and Dr A Senthil Vel, expert member.
According to an HSPCB report, the preliminary examination for the assistant environmental engineer position was conducted by Haryana State Public Service Commission (HSPSC) on April 7 and the recruitment process is still ongoing.
In addition, HSPSC has already conducted an examination for junior environmental engineers. These officials are responsible for monitoring air quality levels, carrying out inspections, conducting surprise checks and collecting samples. They are also authorised to impose penalties and initiate criminal prosecution against violators."

In a press statement, Sachdeva alleged that the data from Indian Agricultural Research Institute and reports submitted to Supreme Court confirmed that stubble burning in Punjab and dust from poorly maintained roads in Delhi were the major contributors to air pollution in north India, particularly Delhi. ""The responsibility lies with AAP govts in Punjab and Delhi, but environment minister Gopal Rai avoids discussing these issues,"" Sachdeva alleged. He added that the five-point plan presented by Rai a few days ago to reduce pollution over the next 15 days failed to offer a concrete solution to tackle stubble burning.

""As usual, Gopal Rai shifts the blame on firecrackers, despite the absence of any scientific evidence supporting his claim. The real reason for ban on firecrackers is Rai's anti-Hindu ideology,"" he further alleged.
Sachdeva claimed that poorly maintained roads were a bigger reason for pollution than vehicular emissions.
Gupta charged that the Air Quality Index near ITO and Anand Vihar was recorded at 361 and 405, respectively, which posed a serious health threat to the residents of Delhi but AAP govt ""lacked the will and a concrete plan"" to improve this situation. He also alleged that the ammonia level in the Yamuna's water had reached a dangerous level, and the white froth spread across the river signified Delhi govt's helplessness.
Delhi Congress president Devender Yadav said there was no sign of the air quality improving any time soon.
AAP claimed that the situation at Anand Vihar was worsening because of the pollution of diesel buses at UP's Kaushambi Depot. ""Cases of stubble burning are rising each day in BJP-led UP and Haryana. The two states are also discharging high volumes of industrial waste in the Yamuna. If BJP truly cared for Delhi, it should stop the theatrics and work with their own state govts to address the pollution problem,"" AAP said."

On Friday, the Union health ministry had urged states and Union Territories to curb stubble burning and encouraged people to use public transport and minimise exposure to pollution.

As per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the particulate matter (PM) 2.5 concentration (fine inhalable particles with diameters 2.5 micrometres and smaller) on Sunday was five times above the recommended limit outlined in the World Health Organization's air quality guidelines.
The CPCB report said the air quality index (AQI) in Agra was recorded at 149, or ""moderate"" category, with PM 2.5 remaining a prominent pollutant. On Saturday, the AQI in Agra was categorised as ""moderate"" at 106. AQI in the ""moderate"" category can cause ""breathing discomfort to the people with asthma, lungs and heart diseases"", the report said.

Many tourists complained of difficulty in breathing, coughing, and a burning sensation in their eyes. Vikram Gujral, an NRI from Canada visiting Agra with his wife and parents, said, ""We couldn't see the Taj properly as it is engulfed in smog. My parents are complaining of irritation in the eyes and shortness of breath. Taj Mahal is a world heritage site, and authorities must take suitable action to keep the vicinity pollution-free.""

Cathrine Emanuel from France, who was with her fiancée, added, ""We wanted to see the sunrise around the Taj and click some memorable pictures, but pollution has ruined it. We could only witness the beauty of the monument from inside.""
Shakeel Chauhan, national general secretary of the Tourist Guide Federation of India, said that the mausoleum remained covered in smog in the morning. ""The rising levels of pollution will adversely affect the tourism industry,"" he said, urging authorities to use scientific methods, such as deploying anti-smog guns near the monuments, to control poor air quality.
Meanwhile, the number of people suffering from respiratory issues has increased. In the last 48 hours, over 100 patients with breathing difficulties were admitted to the SN Medical College, Lady Lyall Hospital, the district hospital, and other health centres in Agra.
Dr Sharad Gupta, an IMA central working committee member, said, ""Prolonged exposure to PM 2.5 and 10 can harm the respiratory system as the ultra-fine particulates can find their way deep into the lungs and also enter the bloodstream. People should wear face masks, while patients with asthma and tuberculosis should avoid public places.""

While the hospital emergencies will fill with cases of cough, cold, asthma, and breathing difficulties, air pollution acts as a silent killer especially for the unborn foetus. The pollutants present in the air can cross the placenta and affect both the placenta and the baby, apart from causing problems to the mother. Air pollution can also cause high blood pressure in the mother, breathing problems, and precipitate an asthma attack which can further cause problems for the baby inside. Infact, Air pollution exposure can result in the development of asthma during the childhood of the foetus.

How to navigate pregnancy to avoid adverse effects of pollution
Stay Indoors: A pregnant lady is at a higher risk in such an environment, so to escape the worst AQI air, avoid going out during peak pollution hours.
Drink plenty of water: Staying hydrated is the key to avoiding diseases and health issues caused by air pollution, such as coughing, etc. Drinking plenty of water keeps your organs healthy.
Use a mask while you are outdoors: A medical mask makes sure that you don’t inhale the pollutants present in the air and can filter the air you breathe to some extent.

It comes along with deadly consequences that are likely to impact a person’s health, causing severe lung and heart diseases. While there is a strong belief that older people are more susceptible to serious health issues, new research and studies have shown that young individuals are also at risk, particularly concerning cardiovascular health. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide and this makes this a serious health concern that needs to be looked after.
Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Diseases: The Rising Concern Among Youngsters
It is well known that air pollution can cause severe health issues, but it has only been in recent years that the magnitude of this problem has been recognised. Particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds are among the dangerous components that make up air pollution. These pollutants come from a variety of sources including industrial procedures, construction sites, vehicle emissions, and natural disasters like wildfires. Severe heart issues such as stroke and hypertension are no longer confined to older people. These severe heart issues are now affecting young individuals.

Heart Issues in Young Adults: Causes and Reasons
Heart Rate and Rhythm: Air pollution has a negative impact on a person's heart. Many studies have stated that there are pollutants in the air that can affect a person's heart rate, eventually increasing the risk of other heart diseases. An increased exposure to bad air can negatively impact heart rate and rhythm. The heart muscle can be directly affected by pollution in the air. Heart failure can eventually be caused by reduced efficiency and blockage of the arteries.

Lifestyle and Heightened Exposure: Many young adults lead an active social lifestyle, making them more susceptible to air pollution. Leading a life that requires constantly being on the go exposes a person to an extremely polluted environment. Young adults are often drawn to urban areas that have greater pollution levels for social, professional, and educational purposes. This exposure, especially during peak traffic areas, places young adults at a greater risk of developing heart diseases.
Keep your heart young post-30s with these 4 simple ways

Hypertension: Young people who are exposed to more air pollution than others are front of the line to be at risk for 'high blood pressure' and 'hypertension.' Studies have explored the link between pollution and AQI levels and a heightened blood pressure status. It is a serious health issue that can lead to other co-morbidities and heart issues.
Protective Measures and Strategies
- It is necessary to educate young adults of the dangers of air pollution. Proactive messaging of health measures can arm people with the knowledge to take good care of their health.
- There has been an urgent need for awareness initiatives and these initiatives can include tips for reducing exposure, such as staying indoors during high pollution days.
- Regular health monitoring is also a necessity these days. Young individuals should be encouraged to undergo a regular health examination that includes heart health evaluation. Hypertension and other heart conditions can severely damage one’s health, and early detection of these issues can lead to timely interventions and better results.
Air pollution is a serious and often overlooked threat to the heart health of young adults. Understanding the link between air quality and heart health is important for developing effective public health strategies and promoting a healthier and sustainable future for young individuals.

Himanshu, a visitor to Delhi, described the pollution as ""suffocating"" and urged the government to take action to reduce it. A daily cyclist in the city shared similar concerns, stating, “We can’t breathe properly; we get tired faster due to the pollution. We take precautions like wearing a bandana, but nothing seems to work as pollution levels continue to rise.”
The cyclist also noted that the government’s measures, such as stopping construction and implementing the odd-even rule, do not seem effective. He added, ""There should be constructive measures to encourage people to use public transport and carpooling.""


BJP spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari criticized the AAP government, stating, ""Pollution in Delhi is at a life-threatening level. Since 2015, Arvind Kejriwal has claimed he would take a dip in the Yamuna, but he has yet to do so because the river is dirty and the situation is dire due to pollution.""
He further stated, ""Arvind Kejriwal can install 40 air purifiers in his large bungalows and hotels, but what about the person living in a slum? What about the poor who cannot afford an air purifier? Arvind Kejriwal will not understand this because he has become the party of only one special person; his job is to make money through liquor scams, not to serve the public.""

Ahead of the festival of lights, the Delhi government has banned firecrackers until January 1 to control pollution. The situation is further aggravated by toxic foam on the Yamuna River in Kalindi Kunj.
Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai criticized the BJP in return, suggesting that all parties should cooperate and highlighting the ineffectiveness of mere dramatics in solving pollution.
""I believe all governments and parties need to work together. When I was preparing the winter action plan, I wrote to the BJP President, but I have yet to receive any response or suggestions,"" said Gopal Rai.

Kolkata, once a city proud of its trees, is watching its green cover rapidly fade away. According to the India State of Forest Report 2021, the city lost 30% of its forest cover between 2011 and 2021. And with Diwali, with its polluting fumes, round the corner, we look at how the rapid deforestation is making it more difficult to rein in the air pollution, and how important it is to restore the city’s green cover.
Dana, a wake-up call to protect Kolkata’s green cover
Cyclone Dana may have spared Kolkata, but it came as another grim reminder for us to focus more on going green. “Trees protect us from the intensity of storms. But the reduction of forest cover in and around the city has left us exposed to future cyclones. We need a sustainable system to protect and replant trees. Every tree lost takes decades to replace,” says Ayush Sarda, social entrepreneur.

Changes in temperature, more sun exposure, and higher levels of pollutants in the air can make our skin open to many problems.
The connection between indoor and outdoor air quality
Our skin acts as an essential shield against environmental threats, but too much contact with pollutants can weaken its protective abilities resulting in skin problems like psoriasis, eczema, heat rash, and acne. We might think the air quality outside is different from what we have inside, but they're linked. When we open windows to bring in fresh air, we also let pollutants and allergens enter our homes. This affects the air we breathe and often puts our skin in contact with these harmful substances for long periods.
We spend up to 90 percent of our time indoors, making indoor air quality a critical factor in our overall well-being. Pollen, dust, and other airborne particles can compromise indoor air, and while the immediate effects may not always be visible, prolonged exposure to poor air quality can significantly impact our skin's health over time.

Moreover, accelerated aging has been correlated with particulate matter (PM) pollution exposure – manifesting in increased pigmentation spots, wrinkles in the upper lip & forehead. Another study points out that air pollution has a strong connection to signs of getting older – including pigment spots and wrinkles. Research shows that for every increase in exposure to soot and traffic particles, people tend to have 20% more pigment spots on their faces.
Addressing skin problems with air purifiers
To combat these issues, air purifiers offer an effective solution by filtering out pollutants, creating a cleaner indoor environment and helping to minimize the skin’s exposure to particle and gas pollutants. However, achieving the full benefits of an air purifier requires proper usage and maintenance. Here are some key insights to help you harness the potential of air purifiers:
Removing fine and ultra-fine particles: While PM2.5 particles are commonly discussed; particles do not stop at 2.5 microns. PM0.1 particles, or ultra-fine particles, can penetrate the fine sacs in our lungs (alveoli) and even enter our bloodstream.
Advanced filtration technologies: HEPA and carbon filters can remove a wide range of pollutants, including dust, pollen, pet dander, smoke, and VOCs, including Formaldehyde. Cooling airflow and powerful heating capabilities help maintain air quality year-round whilst also supporting thermal comfort through the seasons.
Coverage and air circulation: To determine your needs, measure the approximate length, width, and height of your room.
Improving sleep quality: Quality sleep is essential for overall health and skin vitality. Polluted air can disrupt sleep, potentially causing sinus irritations and breathing problems. Air purifiers create a cleaner sleeping environment, helping to reduce prolonged exposure to pollutants during sleep.
Smart features: Many air purifiers include intelligent functionalities like auto mode, which adapts purification levels according to air quality. This guarantees uninterrupted protection without manual intervention.
Additional tips for healthy skin
Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water helps maintain skin hydration, which is crucial for its overall health and resilience against pollutants.
Healthy diet: A diet rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals can support skin health. Foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds can help protect the skin from damage.
Sun protection: Regular use of sunscreen can help to protect the skin from UV damage, which can exacerbate the harmful effects of pollutants.
The advantages of reducing pollution exposure on skin health are clear. Alongside staying hydrated and protected from the sun, adding an air purifier to your routine helps guard against airborne pollutants—an often-neglected aspect. As we aim to maintain youthful and healthy skin, opting for a high-efficiency air purifier is a practical step toward creating a cleaner indoor environment and supporting skin wellbeing.

Health officials are imploring residents to exercise caution and seek medical assistance should they encounter any respiratory or cardiac complications.
Residents have been advised to curtail outdoor activities, particularly during periods of peak pollution and to adhere closely to health advisories.
""The Sector 10 civil hospital, govt hospitals in Sohna and Pataudi and all primary health care centres (PHCs) in Gurgaon are under instructions to set up
burn wards to ensure patients get immediate medical aid,"" he said.
To prioritise the treatment of burn cases, sub-divisional hospitals have devised a roster for physicians stationed in the burn ward to ensure that patients receive uninterrupted care throughout the night of Diwali, officials said.
The incidence of burn injuries exhibits a marked increase on Diwali compared to the remainder of the year.
Ambulances will be on standby to attend to patients.
The standard medical protocol for burn patients necessitates their placement in a room with regulated temperature, ideally an air-conditioned room equipped with proper ventilation facilities.
""The chronic effect of smoke from firecrackers worsens after the smoke gets trapped in the atmosphere, owing to a winter phenomenon called thermal invasion. It involves a change in the normal tendency of air to cool down as it rises in altitude, creating issues in patients who already have a respiratory illness,"" Yadav said.
Physicians affiliated with private hospitals have residents adopt precautionary measures while celebrating Diwali.
A majority of hospitals grapple with a surge in respiratory ailments on Diwali for years.
""Every winter, the national capital and its surrounding regions are blanketed in toxic smog, made worse by bursting firecrackers during Diwali. Burning stubble or leftover post-harvest straw in the farms of neighbouring states ahead of winter sowing aggravates the situation,"" head of critical care and pulmonology, CK Birla Hospital (Gurgaon) Dr Kuldeep Kumar Grover said.

According to Central Pollution Control Board records, 23 out of 30 monitoring stations in Mumbai showed average Air Quality Index (AQI) plunging to 131 on Friday, compared to 101 on Oct 8 and 116 on Oct 2.
The worst affected was Navy Nagar in Colaba with air pollution reaching a ‘hazardous' level of 312, triggering a health alert for residents, especially those with respiratory issues. Byculla, Mazgaon and Worli were among the areas with ‘very unhealthy' AQI (see graphic). AQI is based on the concentration of carcinogenic particulate matter (PM2.5) in air.
With wind patterns changing after the withdrawal of the southwest monsoon on Oct 15, Mumbai has been witnessing smoggy conditions coupled with warmer temperatures and low air quality. According to weather experts, low wind speed combined with moisture-laden air makes emissions and dust from automobile, industrial and construction activities lie suspended in air instead of being blown away by sea breeze. The particulate matter trapped in moisture gets warmer due to temperature and eventually makes climatic conditions sultry.
As temperatures are expected to drop and wind speed may increase, AQI is likely to improve in the next few days, said weather experts.

NEW DELHI: There is more bad news for those living in cities with high pollution. A new study has revealed a direct link between prolonged exposure to air pollutants and the development of physical disabilities, especially among elders, leading to difficulties in performing activities of daily living (ADL).
The study, conducted in the US with 15,411 participants over an average follow-up period of about eight years, found that at least 48% of the participants aged 65 years and above reported new difficulties in performing daily activities due to exposure to pollution.
The researchers discovered that higher concentrations of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10-2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were associated with increased risks of ADL disability, although not all associations reached statistical significance. Interestingly, ozone (O3) was found to be associated with a lower risk of ADL disability.
""The results of our study indicate that exposure to air pollution may be a significant, yet often overlooked, contributor to the development of physical limitations in older individuals. However, further investigations are necessary to confirm and expand upon these initial findings,"" stated the researchers.

Several city-based doctors TOI spoke to said the risk of physical disability is higher in older adults because of oxidative stress, muscle fatigue and the development of disabilities.

Dr Akshay Budhraja, senior consultant and head of respiratory and sleep medicine, Aakash Healthcare, said inhaling pollutants like PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 can lead to inflammation and oxidative stress in the lungs, which can have far-reaching effects on the entire body, not just the respiratory system. These changes can be particularly harmful to older adults, as they are more vulnerable to the consequences of oxidative stress.

Dr Arunesh Kumar, senior consultant, respiratory medicine, Paras Health, noted that older adults, especially those aged 65 and above, experience a natural decline in organ function and immune resilience as part of the ageing process. This age group is also more likely to have comorbidities, such as heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes, which makes them more susceptible to the harmful effects of pollution.
Dr Satya Ranjan Sahu, senior consultant, pulmonology, Narayana Hospital, said ADLs are basic self-care tasks that people perform to maintain independence and care for themselves. They include eating, dressing, bathing, using the toilet, getting in and out of bed or a chair, and walking. As people age, they experience a natural decline in muscle mass, bone density and organ function.
""The cumulative effect of long-term exposure to air pollutants degrades these physiological systems, leading to increased vulnerability to conditions like cardiovascular disease, lung disease and cognitive decline. These factors impair physical abilities, making it harder for older adults to perform ADLs,"" he said.
Stressing the importance of reducing pollution exposure for seniors, Dr Nikhil Modi, senior consultant at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital's department of respiratory, critical care and sleep medicine, said, ""It is recommended they stay indoors on high-pollution days, use air purifiers and wear protective masks when venturing outside.""
He also highlighted the significance of managing chronic conditions through proper medical care, such as using prescribed inhalers or oxygen therapy, which can help alleviate the negative impact of pollution on health."

This is being seen as an anomaly by civil society and environmentalists. Over a hundred of them now want not only a restriction on the capacity of WTEs but also to bring their operation under the Graded Response Action Plan that deals with pollution spikes.
Pointing out that the residents of Delhi lose 12 years of life expectancy to air pollution, a letter sent by the conglomerate says, ""Though Delhi's air pollution stems from various sources, the contribution from burning about 7,250 tonnes of unsegregated municipal solid waste daily in the city's four waste-to-energy incinerators is often overlooked, despite pollution in Delhi reaching a life-threatening level.""

With GRAP Stage 2 restrictions implemented from Oct 21 after the AQI reached ‘very poor' levels, pollution control measures are mandatory, including suppressing of dust by sprinkling water, ban on all firecrackers, increased parking charges to discourage private car usage and increasing the frequency of buses and Delhi Metro services. However, WTE plants continue to operate without restrictions.
The letter also calls for a halt to the expansion of WTE plants and suspension of their operation when AQI reaches 201 (‘poor' air), a comprehensive study on the impact of WTEs on Delhi's air quality and human health, a focus on systemic transformations in waste management, including effective implementation of local bylaws on solid waste management with priority on waste minimisation, source segregation, penalties for non-compliance and restricting the manufacturing and usage of single-use plastic.

Earlier this week, TOI had pointed out that CAQM was overlooking the impact on air quality of the city's four WTEs at Okhla, Narela, Tehkhand and Ghazipur. These power generation plants lack a separate, distinct, or clear-cut guidelines under GRAP.
""Incineration of mixed waste produces toxic particles, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulphur dioxide due to inefficient burning, which can cause respiratory ailments and chronic lung diseases,"" said Swati Singh Sambyal, an independent resource management expert. ""GRAP must urgently include WTE plants to ensure residents of areas affected by such plants the right to breathe.""
Experts wondered why the WTEs have been ignored in the anti-pollution strategy. ""Despite being akin to the 'red category' industry due to toxic emissions like SOx, NOx, dioxins, furans and hazardous ash, WTEs continue to operate,"" said environmentalist Bhavreen Kandhari. ""In fact, there are plans to expand incineration capacity to over 6,000 tonnes per day by 2027. Other pollution sources are restricted, not these. Why?"""

Air pollution leads to acute health problems and worsens chronic diseases affecting the respiratory, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular systems. It often causes an increase in premature deaths, especially among children, pregnant women, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing conditions.
Dr. Goel stressed the need for state health departments and healthcare facilities to step up their readiness. This includes public awareness campaigns, messaging in regional languages, strengthening the healthcare workforce, and participating in surveillance systems for air pollution-related diseases under the National Program on Climate Change and Human Health.

He highlighted the importance of raising public awareness about preventing further air quality degradation. Recommended actions include discouraging stubble and waste burning, reducing firecrackers, promoting public transport, limiting the use of diesel generators, and curbing smoking.
Outdoor activities like sports and exercise should be restricted for vulnerable populations, including the elderly, pregnant women, and those with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Dr. Goel advised those experiencing symptoms due to poor air quality to seek immediate medical attention.

BMC stated it has come to the notice of the municipal administration that wood and similar fuels are being used extensively for cooking by workers residing at construction sites.
""Such fuels produce smoke and can also pose safety concerns. Considering this, the developers must arrange for workers' meals at such locations so that they do not have to burn wood and any other materials for cooking, thereby preventing smoke. Additionally, the construction sites will remain safer,"" said the civic body in a statement.
That apart, it is also learnt that contractors working on infrastructure works, such as the construction of roads and bridges under the civic jurisdiction, have been mandated to submit an ‘Environment Management Plan' report to BMC. Seeking to curb pollution from infrastructural projects, the civic report has called for the enlisting of the sources of pollution at the project site alongside a detailed plan to mitigate and manage the identified factors.

Additionally, India leads in asthma-related fatalities, representing 43% of global deaths.
Despite the significant health and economic impact, awareness remains low among both healthcare professionals and the public. Addressing the root causes, improving early diagnosis, promoting treatment adherence, and enacting effective public health policies are crucial to managing this growing burden.
The culprits behind India's respiratory disease crisis
Air pollution: Air pollution significantly contributes to India's respiratory health crisis. Millions are exposed daily to harmful levels of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) from vehicle emissions, industrial pollutants, construction dust, and agricultural waste burning. Poor air quality exacerbates conditions like asthma and COPD and increases the risk of pneumonia and lung cancer. In cities with an Air Quality Index (AQI) above 500, breathing the air is akin to smoking 25-30 cigarettes a day. For instance, an AQI of 300-350 could equate to smoking 15-20 cigarettes daily, underscoring the severe health risks associated with toxic air in India.

Smoking and vaping: Tobacco use remains a major health issue in India, with over 267 million users. Smoking is a primary cause of respiratory diseases like lung cancer, COPD, and chronic bronchitis. The chemicals in tobacco smoke damage airways and impair lung function, leading to approximately 1.2 to 1.3 million deaths annually in India. Secondhand smoke is equally harmful, often more so due to the lack of filtration. Vaping, marketed as a ""safer"" alternative, introduces its own risks. Although e-cigarettes may contain fewer harmful chemicals than tobacco, they are not risk-free. Studies show that vaping can cause respiratory damage within 5 to 10 years, raising concerns about long-term health effects.

Indoor air pollution: In rural areas, indoor air pollution is a significant issue, with many households using traditional biomass fuels like wood, coal, and animal dung for cooking and heating. This results in high levels of indoor smoke and particulate matter, leading to respiratory problems, particularly among women and children who spend more time indoors. Chronic exposure can cause asthma, COPD, and acute respiratory infections.
Occupational hazards and industrial emissions: Workers in industries such as mining, construction, and manufacturing face increased risks of respiratory diseases due to exposure to dust, chemicals, and fumes. This occupational exposure contributes to conditions like silicosis, asbestosis, and COPD. Additionally, industrial emissions degrade air quality, impacting both workers and surrounding communities.
Managing India’s respiratory disease burden
To effectively manage and reduce the rising incidence of respiratory diseases in India, a comprehensive approach is essential, focusing on prevention, early diagnosis, and long-term treatment. First and foremost, addressing air pollution is crucial. Tackling this issue requires coordinated efforts between the government, industries, and the public. Although initiatives like the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) aim to reduce particulate matter levels, stricter regulations and enforcement are necessary. Measures such as controlling emissions from vehicles and industries, promoting cleaner fuels, and encouraging sustainable farming practices to cut down on crop burning are critical. Additionally, enhancing public transport, adopting electric vehicles, and increasing urban greenery can help mitigate pollution in cities.
In parallel, controlling tobacco and vaping is vital. Accessible tobacco cessation programs that offer both counseling and pharmacological support are necessary for effective intervention. Public health campaigns should focus on educating younger populations about the risks of smoking and vaping, while stricter regulations on the sale and marketing of vaping products are needed to curb their use. Schools and colleges should play a key role in these efforts, ensuring that students are well-informed about the dangers associated with smoking and vaping.
Furthermore, improving indoor air quality, especially in rural areas, is essential. Promoting clean cooking solutions like LPG, electric stoves, or solar cookers can significantly reduce indoor air pollution. While government programs such as the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana have made strides in providing free LPG connections to low-income households, more efforts are needed to ensure widespread adoption. Educating rural populations about the health risks of traditional cooking methods can also foster behavioral change.
Early detection and treatment adherence are equally important. Raising awareness about the symptoms of chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, COPD, and lung cancer is critical for timely diagnosis. Screening programs targeting high-risk groups, including smokers and those exposed to indoor air pollution, can facilitate early detection. Once diagnosed, adherence to treatment is essential for managing symptoms and preventing disease progression. Emphasizing the importance of regular medication use, coupled with subsidized medications and patient education, can improve adherence and long-term outcomes.
Lastly, public health campaigns and education play a significant role in reducing stigma and encouraging early medical intervention. Community-driven awareness initiatives should target both rural and urban populations, highlighting the risks associated with smoking, vaping, and air pollution. By integrating these efforts, India can better manage and mitigate the growing burden of respiratory diseases.

The index was recorded at 247 on Wednesday, while it was 223 on the previous day. It has been in the poor category for the fourth consecutive day.
Experts attributed this increase to changes in wind direction, low wind speed and emissions from burning of garbage and firewood, and traffic congestion and dust. The share of pollutants PM2.5 and PM10 has also gone up, as evidenced by data from Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB). According to the Decision Support System by IITM, the share of farm fire in pollution level was below 8% on Oct 22.
The HSPCB data from all three air quality monitoring stations in the city revealed that PM2.5 and PM10 levels steadily increased in the past seven days. For instance, the average of PM2.5 was 185µg/m3 on Oct 17, and it touched 227µg/m3 on Oct 23. Relatively larger pollutants — PM10 — were recorded at 112µg/m3 and rose to 220µg/m3 during the same time period.

According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), surface winds with speed ranging from 4 kmph to 12 kmph are expected in the region for the next five days. The AQI is likely to deteriorate to ""very poor"" in the coming days as prevailing meteorological conditions and calm winds are unfavourable for effective dispersion of pollutants.
""Burning of garbage, traffic congestion and broken roads are pushing the level of pollutants in the air. These get trapped in the atmosphere because of low temperature,"" said HSPCB regional officer (south) Vijay Chaudhary.

Residents also pointed out that open burning of waste is another source despite the imposition of Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) for air pollution across NCR. ""The garbage disposal system is not in place, so people tend to burn waste. Also, all major roads in the area are broken, which is leading to traffic congestion and road dust. These are major reasons that we are suffering,"" said Vishal Singh, a resident of Sector 85.
Experts said smoke from burning waste and leaves releases pollutants that can embed themselves deep in lungs when inhaled. ""Waste burning in the open releases PM2.5, PM10, oxides of nitrogen, and carbon monoxide. These make the air toxic,"" said Shubhansh Tiwari, a research associate at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).
A pollution department official said they are taking measures to ensure all GRAP norms are enforced. ""We are closely monitoring hotspots for garbage burning and carrying out night patrols.
According to GRAP rules, first-time offenders will be fined Rs 5,000, and violation for a second time will lead to a 20% hike in penalty. We are working to deal with open burning of garbage in the area, which is a big contributor to air pollution in the region. We are taking help from MCG in dealing with this problem,"" said a senior HSPCB official.
Meanwhile, Delhi air quality deteriorated with many areas now facing severe pollution. The winds in the region were calmer and, therefore, did not efficiently dispersed pollutants.
Besides, north-westerly winds also brought pollutants created by stubble burning in neighbouring states. There was an increase in local pollution sources too.The city's AQI on a scale of 0-500 was 367 at noon, which improved marginally to 364 by 4pm and to 361 by 8pm.
While this indicated the air quality was in the ‘very poor' category, the air readings in Anand Vihar, Jahangir Puri, Dwarka, Vivek Vihar and Wazirpur fell to the ‘severe' category in the early afternoon, with Anand Vihar being the worst polluted, logging an AQI of 406 at noon and a fall to 433 by 8 pm."

Explaining why the air pollution comes down during rains, experts say that dust particles get heavy in showers and do not fly in the air. Vehicular pollution also decreases as tyres do not lead to the flying of pollutants and dust in the air, as it settles on the ground.
Officials said that apart from the damaged roads, flying dust from vehicles and a spike in construction activities after the rainy season also lead to an increase in pollution levels. Besides, bonfires during winters are also a contributing factor.

Experts pointed out that apart from local factors like people burning tyres and plastic during cold nights, which lead to pollution levels going up, weather also plays a role in the air quality. The meteorological department officials said that during this time of the year, winds from Punjab and Delhi blow over the state, due to which the air quality index of MP cities could go up by 20 per cent. The second reason is that air pollutants come closer when the temperature falls. From the mid-troposphere, it comes to the low troposphere, which leads to an increase in pollution levels.
Air quality is measured by taking into account the levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), RSPM10, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the air. Of the four, officials said, PM2.5 is the most harmful for health and causes severe lung diseases. PM10 is due to dust and construction, including the building of roads, while PM2.5 is due to dust, human activity, and climatic conditions."

Last year, Delhi govt announced the plan of conducting artificial rain in Nov to control air pollution. However, the plan was shelved as meteorological conditions were found to be unfavourable and the moisture level was not sufficient for inducing artificial rain.
""Cloud seeding is a process that involves the artificial induction of rain, to reduce air pollution by washing out pollutants from the atmosphere.

According to the decision, NDMC's parking fees — off-road and indoor — were doubled from the existing rate until the revocation of GRAP stage II.
Off-road parking lots are those on the side of main carriageways, such as at Connaught Place. Indoor parking refers to those in covered areas of a complex, such as Palika Bazaar, Shivaji Stadium and the Baba Kharak Singh parkings, an official said.

The enhancement of parking charges will not be implemented for monthly passes and on-street lots where the fee is already high due to heavy footfall, such as Pandara Market and Bengali Market. The increased fee includes raising the fee for four-wheelers from Rs 20 to Rs 40 per hour, Rs 10 to Rs 20 for two-wheelers, and Rs 150 to Rs 300 for buses. In comparison, in indoor parking lots, the fee was increased from Rs 10 to Rs 20 for four-wheelers and Rs 5 to Rs 10 for scooters.
NDMC has 152 parking sites, including 113 off-road sites, three indoor sites, 39 street parking sites, and two multi-level parking sites. Users of 116 parking sites will be affected by the decision.
NDMC has also issued guidelines for resident welfare associations and MTAs to control and reduce the sources of pollution on Tuesday."

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday pulled up the central government for making 'toothless' environment laws, says Commission of Air Quality Management (CAQM) Act provision on penalty for stubble burning not implemented.
The SC said that CAQM Act was enacted without creating required machinery for implementing law to curb air pollution. The Centre assured the SC that regulation on penalty under CAQM Act for stubble burning will be issued in 10 days.
The Supreme Court said that it is a fundamental right of all citizens to live in clean and pollution free environment and it is the duty of Centre and state govts to upheld the right of citizen.
CAQM, meanwhile, told the Supreme Court that there has been non-compliance of its order by Punjab and Haryana to stop stubble burning and it issued notices to various concerned officers on why penal action should not be taken against them.

The apex court expressed strong disapproval towards the Punjab and Haryana governments for not taking adequate action against individuals involved in stubble burning. The court has highlighted that, despite laws being in place, no significant prosecutions have occurred.
Addressing the chief secretary of Punjab, the Supreme Court noted that out of 1080 registered FIRs, fines have only been collected only from 473 offenders. ""You are sparing 600 or more people. We will tell you very frankly that you are giving a signal to violators that nothing will be done against them. This has been (the case) for the past three years,"" the court stated."

The cities include Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Shimla, and Varanasi.
The tribunal, while flagging the findings of the study, has issued notices to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), environment ministry, and the state pollution control boards of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Telangana, West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, and listed the matter for hearing on Wednesday.
Referring to the news report, NGT chairperson justice Prakash Shrivastava, judicial member justice Arun Kumar Tyagi and expert member A Senthil Vel in their order noted the study's findings which show that even cities previously considered less polluted, such as Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata, and Chennai, are significantly affected by air pollution.
The Lancet Planetary Health's study on deaths linked to air pollution earlier caught the attention of Lok Sabha members who asked questions to the environment ministry on the issue during the budget session of Parliament in July.

Gurgaon: The city's air remained in the ‘poor' category for the third consecutive day. The air quality index (AQI) rose to 226 on Tuesday, while it was recorded at 221 on the previous day. Sector 51 station recorded the highest AQI at 256, followed by Teri Gram (240) and Vikas Sadan (197). No data was available at Gwalpahari monitoring station.
According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), surface winds with speeds ranging from 4 kmph to 12 kmph are expected in the region for the next six days. The AQI is likely to deteriorate to ‘very poor' in the coming days as the prevailing meteorological conditions and calm winds are unfavourable for the effective dispersion of pollutants.
""The AQI is likely to deteriorate to very poor in the coming days since the wind direction is likely to change to north-westerly on Wednesday, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 is predicted to rise to 11% on Wednesday and further to 15% on Thursday. ,"" said Shubhansh Tiwari, a research associate at the Centre for Science and Environment.
So far this year, the state has recorded 655 cases of stubble burning, releasing particulate pollutants. According to CPCB, the annual average permissible limits for PM2.5 and PM10 are 40µg/m³ and 60µg/m³, respectively.

On Tuesday, the PM2.5 level was highest in Sector 51 (203 µg/m³), followed by 189 µg/m³ in Teri Gram, and 181 µg/m³ in Vikas Sadan. The level of PM10 was the highest at Sector 51 (221 µg/m³), followed by Teri Gram (211µg/m³). Vikas Sadan doesn't record PM10 data. The share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 is predicted to rise to 11% on Wednesday and further to 15% on Thursday. According to an analysis by Climate Trends, a think tank, Haryana and Punjab recorded fluctuations in fire incidents between 2019 and 2023, with notable reductions in 2022 and 2023.

The think tank's analysis of satellite data on fire incidents in Haryana showed that the fire counts dropped from 14,122 in 2019 to 7,959 in 2023, with fire activity consistently higher between Sept and Dec. While Gurgaon, Mewat, and Jhajjhar showed notable rises, Karnal and Kaithal had approximately 86% and 78% fewer cases of stubble burning, respectively. The report also stated that Delhi's air health was significantly impacted by these fire incidents. On days without fires, the city's AQI averaged 175 (moderate).
However, during the same stubble-burning season, AQI increased to 233 (poor), and on days when fires exceeded climatological averages, AQI spiked to 337 (very poor).
Meanwhile, Delhi's AQI spiked to 327 on Tuesday, deteriorating from 310 a day earlier, both in the 'very poor' category. No relief is expected from the haze and toxic pollution for the next few days as pollution is predicted to remain in the red category. Tuesday was the foulest day since Feb 14, when AQI was 341. Though the overall AQI remained in the 'very poor' range for the second consecutive day, Anand Vihar exceeded the city average, recording 417 in the ‘severe' category at 4pm to become the most polluted locality in the capital, according to Central Pollution Control Board data."

The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), which manages most of the city's area, has not yet increased parking charges. A senior MCD official explained, ""The House did not clear the increase. Parking in MCD is based on auction and accordingly the rate is increased.""
This decision comes as Delhi experiences a significant drop in air quality, with the city enveloped in a thick layer of smog. The poor air quality has led to the enforcement of Stage II of the
Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP). This stage imposes a ban on coal and firewood, including tandoors in hotels, restaurants, and open eateries, and restricts the use of diesel generator sets except for emergency and essential services.
Last year, parking charges were also doubled during the enforcement of GRAP II in October."

NEW DELHI: Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday wrote letters to the transport ministers of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, urging them to ensure no diesel buses from their states plied to the national capital in view of GRAP II restrictions in place. With the air quality in Delhi plummeting, Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) second stage restrictions kicked in from 8 am.
Rai announced a slew of measures, including enhanced water sprinkling to control road dust, use of dust suppressants and deployment of additional traffic personnel to ease traffic congestion, among others.
Rai said in his letters that a major component of this air pollution is vehicular emissions largely attributed to the significant number of diesel buses reaching Delhi from their states.
""The impact of diesel emissions on air quality is well established and the large influx of such buses significantly contribute to the degradation of air quality in Delhi, posing serious health risks to the residents,"" he said.

According to weather analysts, it is likely that wind speed will drop further and, therefore, worsen the pollution status. IITM's air quality early warning system also expects the air to be in the ‘very poor' category.
The early warning system bulletin said, ""Meteorological conditions are likely to be extremely unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants. The air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor' category on Nov 2. The air quality is likely to be in the ‘very poor' category from Nov 3 to Nov 5.

Meanwhile, an analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air ranked Delhi as the third most polluted post-Diwali city, with an average PM2.5 of 219 micrograms per cubic metre. Ghaziabad (261) in Uttar Pradesh and Bikaner (237) in Rajasthan were the top polluted areas.
As per the Consortium for Research on Agroecosystem Monitoring and Modelling from Space, there were 379 instances of stubble burning in Punjab on Saturday against 587 a day earlier.

According to the CPCB, an AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. Prolonged exposure to very poor air quality can cause respiratory illnesses.
Neeraj Narayan, member secretary of Bihar State Pollution Control Board, explained that the drop in temperatures and slow wind speed contributed to the increase in
air pollution levels in the city. ""We are shifting from diagonal higher temperature to diagonal lower temperature, as per the seasonal phenomenon. As the temperature will subside to the lower side, the suspended particle will subside to the lower atmospheric strata,"" he said.
He also highlighted that local emissions such as vehicular pollution, road dust, and construction dust contribute to the rising pollution level to some extent.
Pradhan Parth Sarthi, dean of school of earth, biological and environmental sciences at Central University of South Bihar and Coordinator of Centre for Climate Change and LiFE, stated that temperature inversion had begun, and the lack of windy conditions would result in a high concentration of pollutants in the air.
""In January-February, this concentration starts to move towards east side to Kolkata and Bangladesh. The reason for this is that when the westerly wind starts moving from west to east, then the weather conditions become favourable, which gives little respite from the increasing pollution level,"" Sarthi told this newspaper.
Experts predict that air pollution levels will continue to rise in the coming days due to falling temperatures. They recommend immediate implementation of pollution control measures, such as water sprinkling and covered construction, to mitigate the impact of increasing air pollution."

Not surprising, because the locality is one of the 13 pollution hotspots and the most polluted spot in Delhi in 2023 with an annual average PM2.5 concentration of 126 micrograms per cubic metre and the second most polluted in 2022 after Jahangirpuri. Comparably, the national annual standard is 40 micrograms per cubic metre while WHO's guideline is 5 micrograms per cubic metre.
While Delhi govt claims to be implementing measures to mitigate pollution at these hotspots identified in 2018, data proves these areas continue to suffer high pollution. Nine of the 13 places recorded higher annual average PM2.5 concentrations in 2023 than in 2022.
The Centre for Science and Environment's analysis of the Central Pollution Control Board's real-time air quality data shows that the annual average PM2.5 level at Jahangirpuri in 2024 (till Oct 20) at 100 micrograms per cubic metre was 20 times higher than WHO's annual safe guideline and 2.5 times higher than national ambient air quality standards. The PM2.5 concentration at Jahangirpuri is expected to rise further in Nov and Dec. Jahangirpuri recorded an annual average PM2.5 level of 127 micrograms per cubic metre in 2022 and 123 last year.
Another example is RK Puram, which saw annual average PM2.5 levels of 106 micrograms per cubic metre in 2022. It rose further to 120 micrograms per cubic metre in 2023, and this station has already recorded an annual average concentration of 93 micrograms per cubic metre till now.

In 2023, when the winter pollution strategy was released, Delhi govt had decided on separate hotspot-specific action plans. Delhi Pollution Control Committee too prepared an inventory of pollution sources at each hotspot, identifying 65 major sources and 4,555 minor ones of pollutants. The agencies concerned were asked to handle these and a survey is under way on how many pollution sources continue to exist.
In Sept, it was announced that drones would be used for the first time to monitor real-time sources of pollution at the hotspots. However, this is yet to begin, admitted a govt official.

Mukesh Khare, professor emeritus, civil engineering, IIT-Delhi, said CPCB categorised air quality monitoring stations in four categories: residential, commercial, industrial and sensitive areas. ""Unlike abroad, we don't have a ‘roadside' category for monitoring stations. Anand Vihar actually falls in this category because it is surrounded by bus and railway stations and the air quality station is located 200-300 metres from the roadside. IITs in Delhi and Kanpur have pointed out to CPCB to recategorise the Anand Vihar station.""
Khare said in the non-winter months, AQI was mostly in the ‘moderate' category at the hotspots when there is no rain and dust was the major source of pollution, followed by vehicular exhaust. ""In a tropical country, dust is transferred from other areas too. Road dust is stirred by movement of vehicles and the time of dust retention is high,"" he said. ""Though dust is a bigger PM10 pollutant, it can also be PM2.5 sized. Water sprinkling and road vacuuming can help.""
Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, CSE, said, ""The hotspots management approach was adopted in 2018. Since then, enough inventory taking of pollution sources should have been done. However, as the hotspots continue to record high pollution levels, it means there is a gap in action taken.""
She added, ""Local problems have to be resolved at the hotspots. For instance, Anand Vihar has complex sources, including the inter-state bus terminal there, industrial areas in close proximity and the Ghazipur landfill around 3km away. To reduce pollution at Anand Vihar, a systematic approach is needed to deal with deep-rooted problems like industries in Patparganj and the UP border, the landfill and transiting buses to cleaner fuels.""
In response, Delhi govt said it was making consistent efforts and taking all steps to fight pollution, which mostly originated in neighbouring states."

Firecrackers, while adding grandeur to the festival, release harmful toxins and particulate matter into the atmosphere, posing serious health risks, particularly for those with respiratory conditions such as asthma and bronchitis.
Ayurveda, with its centuries-old wisdom, offers solutions that not only address immediate symptoms but also work toward long-term health by balancing the body’s internal systems. The holistic approach of Ayurveda can help mitigate the impact of Diwali pollution on respiratory health and build immunity for future challenges.
The Respiratory Threat of Diwali Pollution
The adverse effects of Diwali pollution on respiratory health cannot be understated. The smoke and particulate matter from firecrackers, combined with the season’s cooler air, aggravate conditions such as asthma and bronchitis. Asthma sufferers, in particular, face inflamed and narrowed airways, which trigger wheezing and breathlessness. Similarly, those with bronchitis experience aggravated bronchial inflammation, leading to persistent coughs and discomfort.

Beyond these immediate concerns, the spike in pollution can worsen pre-existing Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), making breathing even more challenging. The broader health impacts of air pollution also include increased risks of stroke, lung cancer, ischemic heart disease, and a range of skin issues, including rashes and itching.
Ayurvedic Wisdom for Prevention
While the temptation to indulge in the festive spirit is strong, it’s crucial to adopt preventive measures that protect against pollution’s effects. From a practical perspective, avoiding exposure to pollution by staying indoors during peak firecracker hours and using air purifiers can reduce the risk of inhaling harmful particles. Wearing protective masks, especially for vulnerable groups like children and the elderly, is another effective measure.

However, the strength of Ayurveda lies in its proactive approach. Preparing the body well in advance of potential exposure by building immunity is key. Ayurvedic practitioners often recommend starting immune-boosting regimens that include herbal formulations and therapies designed to detoxify the body and strengthen its defense systems. Treatments like Panchakarma and daily intake of immune-boosting herbs ensure the body is better prepared to withstand the impact of pollution.
Ayurvedic Remedies for Respiratory Support
Ayurveda also offers a range of natural remedies that work to support the respiratory system. Certain ingredients, readily available in many households, play an essential role in maintaining respiratory health:
Mustard oil: Stimulates digestion and promotes detoxification, enhancing the body’s ability to eliminate pollutants.
Turmeric: Known for its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, it helps in reducing respiratory inflammation and fighting infections.
Ghee: Acts as a natural shield for the lungs, minimizing the adverse effects of airborne toxins.
Jaggery: A traditional remedy to cleanse the lungs, jaggery enhances hemoglobin levels and helps the body flush out pollutants.
Ginger juice: Boosts immunity and supports digestion, two critical factors in maintaining overall health during times of high pollution.
In addition to these ingredients, a diet rich in beta-carotene, found in vegetables like fenugreek, spinach, and coriander, can help control inflammation in the body. Incorporating these into daily meals, along with drinking plenty of water, supports the body's ability to counteract pollution-induced damage.
Ayurvedic Medicines for Asthma and Bronchitis
For those already experiencing respiratory symptoms, Ayurvedic medicines provide targeted relief. Herbal decoctions like Pathyaksha Dhatryadi Kashayam and Dashamula Katutrayam work by reducing Kapha, which is often associated with mucus build-up and congestion in the chest. These formulations act directly on the respiratory system, helping to clear the airways and reduce inflammation.
One of the core principles of Ayurveda is maintaining balance in Agni, the digestive fire. Poor digestion can lead to the accumulation of toxins, or Ama, which contributes to respiratory issues. Ayurvedic formulations like Jeerakarishtam help in reducing these toxins by improving digestion and minimizing Kapha-related blockages in the chest. Medicines like Kushmanda Rasayana further aid in nourishing lung tissues, relieving dry cough, and improving lung function.
The Holistic Ayurvedic Approach
Ayurveda’s strength lies in its holistic perspective on health. It understands that respiratory health is not merely a function of the lungs but is closely linked to the digestive, immune, and circulatory systems. By addressing the interconnectedness of these systems, Ayurvedic treatments help in achieving long-term well-being.
Pollution-induced respiratory conditions are often a reflection of broader internal imbalances. Ayurveda, therefore, focuses on rectifying these imbalances, not only alleviating immediate symptoms but also preventing future health issues. The digestive system, immune function, and the respiratory system are all targeted in Ayurvedic treatments to ensure the body can combat environmental stressors like pollution more effectively.
Delhi’s air pollution during Diwali is an unavoidable reality, but there are ways to safeguard your health. Ayurveda’s holistic, preventive approach, coupled with natural remedies and carefully selected medicines, offers a powerful defense against the respiratory effects of pollution. By focusing on building immunity, improving digestion, and adopting Ayurvedic respiratory treatments, it is possible to protect both body and mind during this challenging period.

The average AQI of 292 was the worst recorded in October, surpassing the previous day's reading of 285. Out of the 36 monitoring stations, 15 reported 'very poor' air quality, although no area, including Anand Vihar, fell into the 'severe' category. An AQI between 201-300 is considered 'poor', while 301-400 is classified as 'very poor'.
What's causing high level of pollution in Delhi-NCR?
The main source of pollution was PM10 or the coarser particles. According to Central Pollution Control Board, the PM2.5 levels oscillated between 115.8 and 118.2 micrograms per cubic metre.

The national standard for PM2.5 is 60 units and World Health Organisation puts it at 15 for 24 hours. PM10 oscillated between 265.2 and 270 micrograms per cubic metre.
Various sectors contributed to Delhi's pollution, with transportation being the largest contributor at 12.8%, followed by industries in Delhi and peripheral areas at 3%, waste burning at 1.2%, construction at 1.6%, and the residential sector at 3.3%.
Pollutants also entered Delhi from neighboring cities, with Gautam Budh Nagar in Uttar Pradesh contributing 11.4%, Bulandshahr 7.8%, Ghaziabad 6.6%, and Faridabad 4.8%.
Meanwhile, farm fires persisted, with 59 incidents recorded in Punjab, 26 in Haryana, 47 in UP, and three in Delhi. Since September 15, there have been 1,348 stubble burning incidents in Punjab, 627 in Haryana, 657 in UP, and 11 in Delhi.
What are the predictions for this week?
According to the air quality early warning system, AQI is likely to turn ‘very poor’ in Delhi by Sunday as weather conditions are not favourable to ventilate the additional pollutants coming from stubble or waste burning.
“The air quality is likely to be in the ‘poor’ category on Saturday. The air quality is likely to reach the ‘very poor’ category on Sunday and remain there on Monday,” it stated, adding that AQI is likely to oscillate between ‘very poor’ and ‘poor’ for the next six days.
“Met conditions are highly unfavourable for the effective dispersion of pollutants. Additional emissions from sources such as stubble/waste burning are likely to deteriorate air quality significantly,” the air quality early warning system predicted.
The air quality early warning system predicts that the AQI in Delhi is likely to turn 'very poor' by Sunday due to unfavorable weather conditions that hinder the dispersion of additional pollutants from stubble or waste burning.
The air quality is expected to be in the 'poor' category on Saturday and reach the 'very poor' category on Sunday, remaining there on Monday. The AQI is likely to oscillate between 'very poor' and 'poor' for the next six days.
80 anti-smog guns to be installed at 13 hotspots in Delhi
Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Friday held a review meeting on pollution levels of 13 pollution hotspots in the city.
The 13 places are Anand Vihar, Mundka, Wazirpur, Jahangirpuri, RK Puram, Rohini, Punjabi Bagh, Okhla, Bawana, Vivek Vihar, Narela, Ashok Vihar and Dwarka.
Rai said coordination committees have been created for each hotspot. He also directed the installation of 80 antismog guns at the hotspots and said that dust was the major cause of pollution there.
""A total of 80 mobile anti smog guns will be deployed at different hotspots, where water sprinkling will be done, particularly to tackle dust. In many places, it was observed that the increase in pollution is due to higher levels of PM10, which primarily consists of dust particles,"" Rai said.
Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) identified the 13 hotspots in Delhi in 2018 as the annual PM 2.5 concentration at these locations was higher than Delhi’s mean level.
The minister said that at Anand Vihar the influx of diesel buses, particularly BS-3 and BS-4, was a cause for concern. Traffic on Chaudhary Charan Singh Marg and dust accumulation on the roadside were other local sources as was congestion outside the railway station.
DJB to use anti-frothing chemical soon over the surface of Yamuna river
Delhi Jal Board (DJB) chief executive officer Shilpa Shinde visited Kalindi Kunj on Friday. The purpose of her visit was to assess the situation on the ground regarding the reasons behind the frothing in the river.
Officials have stated that the application of anti-frothing liquid on the water surface will commence in the near future. Currently, the authorities are diligently observing the situation to ensure the effectiveness of the implemented measures in addressing the issue.
DJB officials have asserted that the defoamer utilised in the previous year was safe and underwent extensive testing, proving its harmlessness to human health. An official who attended the meeting claimed that from the middle of the month, DJB will install portable anti-surfactant sprinklers downstream of Okhla barrage, both before and during the Chhath Puja festivities.

City doctors say the cases have more than doubled over the past few years and blame it on excessive screen time, worsening air pollution, and modern indoor lifestyles.
""Ten years ago, we saw only 2-3 paediatric dry eye cases a month,"" said Dr Sampath Kumar, a paediatrician at Kinder Hospitals. ""By 2019, that number rose to five, and now in 2024, we're seeing 10-12 cases monthly — an alarming increase,"" he added.
The surge is primarily linked to increased screen time, prolonged stays indoors in air-conditioned environments, and the post-pandemic shift to digital learning and entertainment. Bengaluru's worsening air quality is also adding fuel to the fire, with pollutants and dust further exacerbating symptoms.
This alarming trend isn't confined to children. Dr Yogesh Kumar Gupta, consultant paediatrician and intensivist at Fortis Hospital, noted, ""In the past, we saw just 1-2 cases of dry eyes in children per week, but over the last 2-3 years, this number has skyrocketed to 5-8 cases. The rise in allergies due to pollution, along with prolonged screen time, inadequate hydration, and poor sleep, are key contributors.""

Gupta added that allergic conjunctivitis and autoimmune conditions, such as Sjögren's syndrome, can predispose children to the condition, particularly during summer when the dryness intensifies.
Adults, too, are grappling with the growing problem. ""In Bengaluru, we've seen a 20-30% increase in dry eye cases over the past year, with 15-20 patients daily exhibiting mild to moderate symptoms,"" said Dr ML Sujatha, consultant cataract and cornea refractive surgeon at Sparsh Hospital.

""Those in the age group of 20-40 are particularly vulnerable, because of their reliance on digital devices for work, studies, and social media. Meanwhile, older adults face the risk due to underlying health issues like diabetes and hormonal changes, particularly among women,"" she added.
The role of air pollution cannot be ignored, as airborne pollutants trigger inflammation that disrupts tear production, worsening dry eye symptoms. Dr Ashwin Santosh Shetty, consultant in ophthalmology at Aster CMI Hospital, highlighted, ""With the increase in air pollution, there's been a rise in ocular allergies. Left untreated, these allergies can damage the ocular surface, leading to symptoms similar to dry eyes.""
Precautions to be taken
Preventive measures are crucial in tackling this growing problem. Experts recommend limiting screen time, ensuring adequate sleep, maintaining proper hydration, and following the ‘20-20-20 rule' — where every 20 minutes, individuals should look at something 20ft away for 20 seconds.
""Frequent blinking, ensuring proper nutrition, and controlling indoor environments — such as using air purifiers — can also help,"" advised Dr Sujatha.
Regular eye examinations and timely treatments are essential for managing the condition, with treatment plans often addressing the root cause, from allergies to autoimmune conditions. Dr Shetty warned that untreated dry eyes can lead to long-term damage, urging prompt consultation with an eye specialist for any persistent symptoms."

JIND: In a bid to curb stubble burning, officials including the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) of Narwana has taken stringent action, penalizing farmers and personally putting out the fire in the fields.The move aims to mitigate air pollution and protect the environment, as stubble burning poses a significant threat to environmental sustainability, said officials.
Officials took out a a flag march in collaboration with the Agriculture Department in the villages of the Narwana sub-division that fall under the red and yellow zones and located near Punjab. The aim was to raise awareness among farmers who set fire to crop residue in their fields, which causes significant environmental harm. Residents in all villages were assured not to burn straw. However, when team reached near Nehra village, a fire had been set to paddy residue in a field, causing a considerable amount of smoke. The griculture department and all officials arrived on-site, and together with the fire truck present, they managed to extinguish the fire. A fine of Rs 5,000 was imposed on the farmer responsible for the fire on the spot, said, Daljit Singh, SDM of Narwana town.
Notably , the air pollution level has increased due to incidents of fireworks and stubble burning during Dussehra. On Wednesday, the district's AQI was recorded around 154, which falls into the harmful category for health. Special care is needed for children and those with respiratory issues. As the Diwali festival approaches, incidents of stubble burning in fields tend to rise. Increased air pollution can cause eye irritation, leading to significant discomfort for drivers and the general public, said health officials.
The district has 12 villages categorized as red zones. Despite intensive awareness programs to prevent burning residue, incidents of arson are still not decreasing. Since October 1, there have been 44 reported cases of stubble burning. The Agriculture Department teams have imposed fines totaling over Rs 87,500 on farmers in various villages. However, not a single FIR has been registered yet for the stubble burning incidents. The district's 12 villages classified as red zones include Alewa, Shri Raghkhera, Danoda Kala, Dhmatan Sahib, Kalwan, Ujhana, Rasidna, Jaipur, Muana, Alipur, Badanpur, and Karsindhu and maximum village falls near Punjab border.Special attention is being given to these villages to ensure that no paddy residue is burned.

According to the real-time source apportionment study undertaken by Delhi Pollution Control Committee and IIT-Kanpur, the share of biomass burning (burning of wood, dung and agricultural residue) was 24% from Nov 2022 to Jan 29, 2023. An IIT-Delhi study in 2021 found that haze episodes in Jan were highly affected by biomass burning, likely from the burning wood, coal or roadside trash for cooking or warming.
Similarly, a 2018 joint report by The Energy and Resources Institute and Automotive Research Association of India stated that during winter, fuel (mainly biomass) burning in houses and agricultural fields accounted for an average 14% of PM2.5 and 13% of PM10 pollutants.

In Aug, the Commission for Air Quality Management issued an advisory to all residents' welfare associations and housing societies to provide electric heaters or other suitable appliances to security personnel and other staff to help them avoid burning wood to keep themselves warm.
Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, ""Waste burning can be controlled only when 100% collection, segregation and material recovery is achieved. Alongside, the legacy waste at landfills must be remediated. In fact, the municipality has to implement the Waste Management Rules and central govt programme on this.""
Delhi Fire Services received 2,425 calls about garbage burning from Jan to May this year compared with 1,498 in the same period last year. ""Burning garbage emits such thick smoke that it can hinder rescue operations. It's also hazardous if inhaled,"" a fire official had earlier told TOI."

Govt has called upon police to strictly implement the prohibition on firecrackers. It will also seek the cooperation of the neighbouring states to enforce its ban on firecrackers.
An official said govt would discourage the entry of non-destined trucks into Delhi and prevent waste dumping at the landfills. The entry of all buses from other states, except for CNG, BS-VI diesel and electric ones, will be regulated if curbs under the final stage of central govt's air pollution control plan are invoked, he added.

Agencies will also look after other factors, including ensuring that construction and demolition wastes are not brought into Delhi.
Between Jan 2023 and Jan 2024, of the 30,472 goods vehicles checked for being non-destined at border areas, over 50% were returned for violating pollution norms. Officials said govt was also working on building a joint task force and developing a common platform, which would have a mechanism for fast information transfer among NCR cities. This will especially help in ensuring that firecrackers are not illegally brought in, an official said.
Taking a cue from London, New York and Singapore, govt may consider a congestion tax on vehicles entering the city during peak hours, 8am to 10am and 5.30pm to 7.30pm, from 13 major entry points to curb congestion and pollution.

""Delhi has faced extreme pollution levels in recent years in winters, and we must take every possible step to safeguard the health of our citizens. We urge residents to cooperate and support Delhi's collective fight against pollution,"" added the minister.
Earlier, on Sept 10, Rai had announced the ban on firecrackers.
Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president Devender Yadav said that dust and vehicular emissions were the major causes of pollution in the city, and not firecrackers alone. Rai has announced the firecracker ban when air pollution has already reached hazardous level in the city, he claimed. Recalling the Sept 10 order, he further stated that it took over a month for govt to notify the ban.

Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor alleged that Delhi govt imposed ban on firecrackers without presenting any scientific research. ""BJP supports every strict measure Delhi govt takes against major sources of winter pollution, such as stubble burning in Punjab and dust pollution within Delhi. However, it does not agree with the claim that burning firecrackers for just three to four hours significantly increases pollution…Delhi govt has not presented any scientific report to date proving that firecrackers burned on Diwali night increase winter pollution,"" said Kapoor.
Meanwhile, storage, sale and use of firecrackers in the city continue unabated. Crackers were openly burst on some occasions in the recent past, including at the time of Kejriwal's release and during Dussehra.

The ban extends to the production, sale, and use of all fireworks, including those marketed as eco-friendly or green crackers.
State environment minister Gopal Rai said that winter in Delhi was always marked by a significant increase in air pollution and fireworks contributed to the emissions. ""Like last year, we are imposing a complete ban on the production, storage, sale and use of all types of firecrackers. The online delivery or sale of any kind of firecrackers is also completely banned,"" he said.

Addressing the potential losses faced by firecracker traders, the minister said that it was Delhi govt’s intention to avoid a lastminute ban that could inconvenience both sellers and the public.
Rai highhlighted govt's active efforts in banning firecrackers over the past few years, with this measure being part of the 21-point Winter Action Plan that has been devised to fight the toxic air in the cold months. Govt's decision to ban firecrackers is, therefore, not new, such a ban having been first imple mented in 2017 following a Supreme Court inquiry into the impact of bursting crackers on the capital's air quality.
In 2018, SC banned all conventional firecrackers in Delhi-NCR, but allowed the bursting of green crackers that did not use barium salts in their production. However, due to the difficulty in distinguishing between green and conventional crackers, govt has been imposing a blanket ban on all firecrackers every winter since 2020.

There are 11 coal-based thermal power plants within a 300-km radius of Delhi (see graphic). Additionally, the Goindwal Sahib Power Plant, located just outside this 300 km radius in Punjab, is also considered when making decisions about thermal power plants around Delhi.
According to CREA estimates, released on Sunday, 281 kilotonnes of SO₂ were released by NCR thermal power plants from June 2022 to May 2023. CREA said of the 12 thermal power plants, only Mahatma Gandhi thermal power station (TPS) in Haryana had fully installed FGD while Dadri thermal power plant (TPP) in UP partially installed FGD.
The remaining 10 coal-based power plants have missed four deadlines: Dec 2017, Dec 2019, March 2021 and Dec 2022. The latest deadline for four of these plants is now Dec 2024, while for the remaining six it is Dec 2026. The Centre in 2015 issued notices to all coal-based thermal power plants in this particular zone to install FGD technology. ""Data on FGD installation progress for power plants in India has not been updated since Nov 2023 on the Central Electricity Authority website. The latest available status is only from Oct 2023.

Analysis has shown that the Talwandi Sabo TPP, Rajpura TPP and Panipat TPS, which currently emit 48, 35 and 40 kilotonnes of SO₂ per year, respectively, are expected to achieve the highest reduction of 83% after installing FGD. Manoj Kumar, an analyst at CREA, said: ""SO₂ levels often meet the NAAQS because, once released, SO₂ quickly transforms into sulphates — secondary particles that are major components of PM2.5. These secondary particles have a longer lifetime and pose serious health risks."" He added that the health and economic benefits of FGD far outweigh the costs.
""Thermal power plants in NCR emit 281 kilotonnes of SO₂ annually —16 times more than the 17.8 kilotonnes emitted by burning 8.9 million tonnes of paddy straw. While paddy straw burning causes seasonal spikes, thermal power plants represent a larger, persistent pollution source year-round,"" CREA said. However, stubble burning releases many pollutants and gases, including PM2.5, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methane, whose quantity is higher than SO₂."

4. Cooking is done mainly by biomass fuels (wood, dung, and crop residues) in many households. gives out toxic fumes and ashes in the environment. Besides, low air circulation of common areas also exacerbates worsen the problem.
5. People under certain age in particular working fields including construction and farming may be jeopardized by various lung hazardous agents such as dust, chemicals, and other products.

6. Pulmonary diseases or respiratory infections suffered in childhood are likely to affect lung function. function and also possibly contributing to the development later in life of such diseases as COPD.
7. Evidence also shows that urbanization and changes in lifestyle accommodation is one of the causes of physical inactivity Conclusion has a negative effect on the total respiratory health of an individual.

II. Role of environmental factors, such as air pollution or exposure to second hand smoke, in the rising incidence of COPD among younger people?
1. Air Pollution: Every vehicle emits high Level particulate matter contamination like PM2.5 and PM10 include emissions, industrial discharges, and construction dust. Since the fine particles of these materials easily pass through the air-tight seal around the flanged port, furthest from the lungs where they cause long term inflammation and respiratory diseases. It marks how young people dwelling close to factories, industrial areas receive exposure to towards causing or emitting food for thought, especially pollution which prove hazardous to one’s health primarily affecting the respiratory system. When people use biomass fuels for cooking and heating, then they are bound to develop chronic respiratory diseases. Especially in closed rooms such as in restaurants, bars and theatres.
2. Second hand Smoke: It is observed that the young are also victims of second-hand smoking, and that family members who smoke. This exposure can lead to the COPD to increase.
III. How does lifestyle, including smoking or vaping habits, impact the development of COPD in younger individuals?
They have thousands of chemicals that are inflammable and at the same time cause inflammation and other ailments. damage lung tissue. Smoking in any normal form can help in the development of the COPD disease. Smoking but beginning to smoke at an earlier age or smoking throughout a longer period of time are likely to get COPD later in life. life as a result of the new normal lifestyle which involves being exposed to smoke for long. Growing use of the devices among the youths exposes them to nicotine and other substances. Deposit another’s poisonous particles into the lungs. Some studies showed that most e-cigarettes contain toxic chemicals that can cause respiratory problems.
The use of vapes especially among the youths has douched the number of people exposed to risky substances. products, hence effects lung health in long term of different abstinent substances. When muscles are not exercised, this leads to general decline in respiratory health. Diet induced obesity through use of sedentary lifestyles lead to deterioration of respiratory function and diminished lung function. They have been able to understand that lack of fruits and vegetables in the diets leads to lung disease.
Poor nutrition affects immune system by which the probability of suffer respiratory infections is increased. Interactions between smoking or vaping behaviours with other sources of toxic or carcinogenic and hence, this increases the risk for COPD (such as through air pollution).

It is also essential not to use electronic cigarettes and all types of vaping equipment as these can negatively affect lung health.
Avoid Going Outdoors on Days with Low Air Quality Use Air Purifiers: indoor to filter airborne pollutants Most of these indoor air pollution control measures aim at the physical removal of pollutants from indoor air so that effective ventilation may be achieved. Remember always to open the windows when you are cooking too to allow air circulation in your home. Do regular Exercise: such as walking, cycling or swimming. This can improve lung capacity and overall fitness.

Breathing Exercises: counselling also can be given to patient like deep breathing or yoga also helps in improving lung function and reduce stress.

One might lose 12 years due to this silent killer,"Aug 30, 2024, 13:29 IST","Delhi's air pollution, a scary topic to unfold, is not just an environmental issue; it's a public health emergency that could instantly reduce the life expectancy of its residents by as much as 12 years. According to the latest Air Quality Life Index 2024 report by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), the alarming levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) in the capital are silently shaving years off lives. Delhi is one of the world's most polluted cities, the health repercussions are severe, and the situation demands urgent action.
Can life expectancy be slashed by 12 years?
The report paints a grim picture for Delhiites, warning that residents are set to lose an average of 11.9 years of life expectancy due to the high levels of PM2.5 pollution. This figure is based on comparisons with the World Health Organization's (WHO) air quality standards, which set the annual safe limit for PM2.5 at just 5 micrograms per cubic meter. Even by India's less stringent national standards of 40 micrograms per cubic meter, Delhiites could lose up to 8.5 years of their lives. The reality is that breathing Delhi's air daily is somewhat similar to a slow poison, with long-term exposure leading to severe respiratory and cardiovascular issues.

Is there any positive shift?
Despite the severe situation, there has been a silver lining. The report highlight a 19.3% reduction in particulate pollution in India in 2022, which has added an average of one year to the life expectancy of citizens across the country. This improvement is particularly significant in certain regions like the northern plains, which saw a 17.2% reduction in PM2.5 levels. The decline has been attributed to favourable weather conditions and fewer thermal inversions, which typically trap pollutants close to the ground. While these improvements are encouraging, they are far from sufficient to counteract the deadly levels of pollution still present in cities like Delhi.

The Plastics Problem: Nano & Microplastics and Their Dangerous Impact on Heart Health

Despite some progress, the report highlights that over 40% of India's population still lives in areas exceeding the national air quality standards. In Delhi, even with the recent reductions in pollution, the air quality remains poor. The situation is exacerbated by Delhi’s dense population and industrial activities, which contribute to the persistent levels of PM2.5. The report stresses that without more aggressive and comprehensive measures, the health of millions will continue to be at risk, and life expectancy will remain drastically reduced.
The message is clear: without immediate and sustained action, the air Delhiites breathe will continue to be a silent, deadly killer.

Govt had started organising such events in 2019 when a four-day laser show was held at Connaught Place to encourage people to have a cracker-free Diwali.
Govt has already banned the sale, storage, and bursting of all types of firecrackers across the city until Jan 1, 2025. The air pollution in Delhi spikes during the winter season, and the bursting of firecrackers adds to local emissions.
The official said that govt would keep a close watch on air quality during the festival time. It has identified three locations— Satyawati College in Ashok Vihar, ITI-Shahdara in Vivek Vihar and National Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases at Aurobindo Marg, where monitoring stations will be set up from Oct 24 till Nov 7.

NEW DELHI: The central govt is set to roll out an online system to detect diesel and petrol vehicles older than 10 and 15 years plying on Delhi roads and those without valid fitness and pollution certificates.
The “e-detection” system, which will enable the transport departments to find out where such vehicles are registered to generate e-challans automatically, will start by Diwali, sources said.
This will be a big deterrent for old polluting vehicles from any state entering Delhi roads. Though over a decade old vehicles are not allowed to ply on city roads, enforcement agencies can’t implement it fully as physically checking each vehicle entering from other states is impossible. Edetection addresses this issue to a large extent, officials said.
Under this system, as soon as vehicles cross National Highway toll plazas at Delhi borders, the details from FASTags fixed on vehicles, photograph and registration will be captured. This data will be shared with NIC for matching with the Vahan da tabase, the central repository of all vehicles which has details of the year of registration and validity of documents such as fitness, permit and pollution under control certificate. Subsequently, the transport department concerned will be able to generate e-challans for violation of rule and initiate other actions under the Motor Vehicle Act.

Sources said there have been rounds of deliberations among stakeholders including Delhi govt’s transport department, Union road transport ministry and NHAI for expeditious launch of the new mechanism.
“The target is to start this before Diwali when Delhi faces acute air pollution,” said a source. The official added that there are around 52 entry points, including through NHs, where cameras will be installed to capture the details of FASTags and
vehicle registration numbers. To begin with the NHAI will share the details of vehicles passing through its toll plazas every few hours for matching with Vahan database and subsequently it will be made real time.
The Centre is looking at a gradual roll out of this system across the country to check violations of transport and traffic rules.
TOI has learnt that at present there are about six crore out of the 38 crore registered vehicles across the country are unfit, but there is no clue of how many of these are plying on roads. “Some of these might have been scrapped by unorganised scrap dealers or are lying in yards. Once we have a mechanism to detect unfit vehicles plying on roads, it would be easy to enforce their scrapping,” a source said.
At present, e-detection is being implemented in Odisha for challaning vehicles without valid documents on National Highways."

As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the days forcast indicates a maximum and minimum temperature of 33 degrees Celsius and 19 degrees Celsius, respectively.
Delhi's environment minister Gopal Rai has expressed concerns over the rising pollution in the national capital.
He said that the winds are moving in the northwest direction, which could increase the pollution levels in the national capital territory (NCT) due to
stubble burning in neighbouring states.
""As per the information given by the meteorological department, the winds are now moving in the northwest direction. The effect of stubble burning from Haryana and Punjab will be more visible in Delhi. We have put all our departments on alert mode given the increase in pollution levels.""
""I am going to write a letter to the Union Environment Minister for the third time, urging him to call a meeting. The research conducted by IIT Kanpur regarding artificial rain should be taken forward to resolve the pollution crisis. All the formalities should be fulfilled. I had also written to transport ministers of neighbouring states to not send diesel vehicles in Delhi till the weather is unfavourable,"" Gopal Rai said.
Meanwhile, toxic foam was seen floating in the Yamuna river in Kalindi Kunj as pollution levels in the river continued to remain high.

Gurgaon: The city's air quality has deteriorated over the past six days, primarily due to open waste burning. The heaps of garbage on fire, several spotted by TOI on Thursday, are not just polluting the air but also causing hazards.
There was a fire in Sector 10 that took 20 minutes to douse after trash was set ablaze in a green belt on Thursday. Residents said MCG officials did not respond, after which they contacted the fire officials who eventually doused the flames.
The city's air quality index (AQI) remained in the ‘moderate' category on Thursday at 110. It was 136 on Friday. The Sector 51 station recorded an AQI of 165 on Thursday, followed by Vikas Sadan at 59. Teri Gram and Gwalpahari's data were not recorded. The last time it was in the ‘satisfactory' category was on Oct 5.
According to residents, such incidents go unchecked daily despite multiple complaints to the state pollution control board. Waste-burning hotspots include DLF -2, IFFCO Chowk, Sector-10, Udyog Vihar, and Sector 31, among others. Locals alleged shopkeepers, garbage collectors, sanitation workers, and security guards burn trash in the open.

""Frequent burning of waste like leaves and twigs has led to thick smoke and toxic fumes. The AQI in our locality has worsened and people are facing breathing difficulties,"" said Sector 10 resident Sumit Saini.
Amit Kumar, a resident of Sector 90, said there is no mechanism to clean roads, maintain green belts, or garbage disposal systems in new sectors, due to which people choose the easy way out — burning their waste.

""Waste burning on open grounds releases pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, oxides of nitrogen, and carbon monoxide. PM10 is a coarse particle that embeds itself deep in the lungs, causing diseases,"" said Shubhansh Tiwari, a research associate at centre for science and environment.
Talking about the actions being taken to curb waste burning, HSPCB regional officer Vijay Chaudhary said, ""We have asked both MCG and MCM to take steps to curb garbage burning incidents in the city.""
An MCG official acknowledged the corporation received complaints of open waste burning and they have been forwarded to the concerned sanitary inspectors to carry out checks. ""The issue will be resolved soon and violators will be penalised,"" the official added.
Explaining the health repercussions, Dr Kuldeep Kumar Grover, head of critical care and pulmonology at CK Birla Hospital, said, ""Short-term health effects include headaches, nausea, and skin rashes, while long-term exposure can lead to an increased risk of heart disease and birth defects.""
He added that inhaling large amounts of these pollutants can severely impact the lungs, potentially leading to bronchitis, respiratory swelling, pneumonia, cardiovascular issues, and neurological problems.

The air quality is likely to reach the ‘very poor' category on Sunday and remain there on Monday,"" it stated, adding that AQI is likely to oscillate between ‘very poor' and ‘poor' for the next six days.
""Met conditions are highly unfavourable for the effective dispersion of pollutants. Additional emissions from sources such as stubble/waste burning are likely to deteriorate air quality significantly,"" the air quality early warning system predicted."

A total of 67 cities appeared in the daily top 10 most polluted cities list during the month. Of these, 26 cities made an appearance at least five times over the 30-day period, including Visakhapatnam from Andhra Pradesh, according to the data prepared by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). Vijayawada was listed for three days.
With an average PM2.5 level of 45 µg/m³, Visakhapatnam was the most polluted city in Andhra Pradesh for the last month. According to CREA's report, Byrnihat in Assam/Meghalaya ranked as the most polluted city in India in September 2024.
AP's annual average PM2.5 levels are reported to be between 30-45 µg/m³, which is almost six times higher than the World Health Organisation's recommended limit of 5 µg/m³.

Visakhapatnam's average PM2.5 concentration stands at 50 µg/m³—nearly 10 times higher than the WHO limits—while Vijayawada has an average of 40 µg/m³.
Industrial pollution significantly contributes to the air quality issues in Visakhapatnam. However, vehicular emissions, construction activities, road dust resuspension, and biomass burning also exacerbate air pollution in both Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada.

A total of 13 cities and towns in AP have been identified by the Central Pollution Control Board as non-attainment cities for failing to meet national ambient air quality standards. These include Guntur, Kurnool, Nellore, Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, Anantapur, Chittoor, Eluru, Kadapa, Ongole, Rajahmundry, Srikakulam, and Vizianagaram.
In 1998, the annual average PM2.5 in AP was limited to approximately 17.8 µg/m³.
However, this figure surpassed the 30 µg/m³ mark in 2021, reflecting an increase of over 70% in just 23 years. About 50% of the state's population is exposed to PM2.5 levels exceeding 30 µg/m³.
Nearly five years after the launch of the national clean air programme (NCAP) by the Union govt, most of the 13 non-attainment cities in AP have shown little improvement.
For example, Guntur's average annual PM10 concentration was 58 µg/m³ in 2019-20 (the NCAP's baseline) but rose to 61 µg/m³ in 2023-24, marking a three-point increase.
Similarly, both Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam have witnessed a rise in PM10 levels. Vijayawada's average increased from 57 µg/m³ four years ago to 61 µg/m³ in the last fiscal year, while Visakhapatnam experienced a significant jump from 97 µg/m³ in 2019-20 to 120 µg/m³ in 2023-24.

Dispersed sources of pollution, including unpaved roads, illegal dumping of construction waste, garbage burning, and broken footpaths, are major causes of air pollution.
The IIT-D study, titled ‘The Impact of the Dispersed Sources Programme on Local Air Quality', evaluated the impact of the dispersed sources on reducing PM2.5 locally. Under the guidance of Commission for Air Quality Management, A-PAG (Air Pollution Action Group), a foundation roped in by CAQM to work on dispersed sources of pollution, ran a programme in partnership with urban local bodies. It focused on identifying and resolving civic issues, both short-term such as illegally dumped garbage and debris on public land, and long-term like potholes, unpaved roads and broken footpaths.

To evaluate the impact of the programme on the ground, 35 portable low-cost sensors were deployed after thorough calibration in Jahangirpuri, Rohini, and Karol Bagh, all of which already had an existing continuous ambient air quality monitoring station. The analysis is based on data on the 65 long-term issues that were resolved and which were within the vicinity of the sensors. IIT-D, which used data from the nearest continuous air monitoring stations and portable low-cost sensors, found a decline in PM2.5 levels in these three clusters, reducing by 26.6% in Jahangirpuri, 15.7% in Rohini and 15.3% in Karol Bagh.

Sagnik Dey, professor at the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT-D who led the study, said that for the first time, portable low-cost sensors had been effectively deployed to accurately quantify and demonstrate the potential impact of targeted interventions. ""The substantial reductions in PM2.5 levels locally are promising and underscore the efficacy of this data-driven approach,"" said Dey. ""Our research provides robust evidence that addressing both short-term and long-term pollution sources can yield substantial and sustained improvements in air quality.""

Tariq Thomas, additional commissioner, MCD, said at an event in IIT-Delhi, ""The study highlights the success of MCD and A-PAG's collaborative efforts, showcasing how targeted interventions can lead to notable air quality improvements in the city."" He added, ""MCD has implemented dust control measures, enhanced waste management systems and engaged with residents to create cleaner, healthier neighbourhoods.""

While launching the drive, Rai said that stubble burning was a key contributor to winter pollution. ""Govt has once again initiated free bio-decomposer spraying in fields to address this issue, as was done last year with positive results. The decomposer not only helps in managing stubble but also improves soil fertility,"" Rai said.
He pointed out that due to the short interval between the rice harvest and wheat sowing, timely action was critical to ensure both effectiveness and better outcomes for farmers. He instructed the agriculture department to ensure that bio-decomposer is sprayed in the fields of registered farmers as soon as possible.
""Awareness campaigns are being run by govt among farmers to promote the benefits of spraying. Govt has sourced the powder from Pusa Institute, and the spraying will be carried out under its supervision. Minister Gopal Rai urged farmers who have not yet registered to do so,"" Delhi govt said."

During the hearing, the court also turned its attention to Punjab, questioning the state's use of lenient penal provisions to address stubble burning cases. Justice Oka criticised the state for registering First Information Reports (FIRs) under Section 223 of the BNS Act, one of the mildest penal provisions, in 129 cases of stubble burning. ""You have found the mildest penal provision and registered FIRs,"" Justice Oka remarked.

Punjab's Advocate General (AG) responded by outlining the challenges faced by small-scale farmers, who make up about 70% of the state's farming community. He explained that while stubble-burning mitigation machines were provided free of cost, marginal farmers—those with less than 10 acres of land—struggled with operational costs, such as hiring drivers and purchasing diesel.
Punjab AG proposed a financial grant system to cover these costs, suggesting a burden-sharing model involving both the Central and state governments. ""We can make the machines compulsory if we provide financial grants for the cost of running these machines,"" he said, proposing that the Centre contribute Rs 1,200 crores while Punjab and Delhi would each contribute Rs 375 crores. ""The entire burden is about Rs 2,000 crores. Delhi was favourable to consider it subject to the Centre giving Rs 1,200 crores, but they are saying they are giving Rs 1,000 crores,"" he added.
The court also asked clarification on how many prosecutions had been initiated under Section 15 of the BNS Act, to which the AG said that financial assistance was crucial for encouraging widespread use of the machinery among marginal farmers.
Last week, the bench had also raised concerns about CAQM's efforts, questioning whether pollution levels had decreased over time and urging more robust enforcement. ""The issue of serious pollution. Is it coming down?"" the court asked.
The court asked CAQM to file a more detailed compliance report and stressed the need for grassroots-level implementation of stubble-burning alternatives."

However, he stated that stricter measures under GRAP III are not yet necessary as improvement is expected.
""In this winter season, the Air Quality Index has crossed 400 for the first time in the last two days in Delhi.

Further he said, ""Second, slow wind speed. From today, wind speed is expected to pick up. The maximum temperature recorded today is 29 degrees Celsius. The temperature is expected to rise to 30 degrees Celsius. CAQM met yesterday and it was decided that GRAP III restrictions will not be imposed yet.""
Rai highlighted the impact of surrounding regions on Delhi's air quality. He cited studies indicating that 30% of pollution comes from local sources, while 34% originates from the national capital region.
The government will focus on enforcing existing measures under GRAP Stage 2.
“We will strengthen all ongoing campaigns and actions to mitigate pollution,” Rai stated.

It ordered action against officials. The court also directed states to financially assist construction workers affected by the ban.
NEW DELHI: Considering that many poor students, who are dependent on mid-day meals and also do not have facilities to take online classes, are facing hardships, Supreme Court on Monday allowed the Commission of Air Quality Management (CAQM) to take a decision on opening of schools and educational institutions in NCR but said that other stringent conditions imposed under GRAP-IV would remain in force till further order.
A bench of Justice Abhay S Oka and Justice Augustine George Masih directed CAQM to consider to relaxation in terms of clause 5 and clause 8 of GRAP-IV as well as clause 11 of GRAP-III measures (pertaining to discontinuing physical classes).
The bench also took strong exception that the authorities did not comply with the order of CAQM in enforcing GRAP-IV measures on barring trucks to enter within the territory of the national capital and directed the Commission to initiate proceedings against the state govt, transport commissioner and Delhi police commissioner. This was revealed in a report filed by 13 young lawyers who were appointed as court commissioners and visited over 86 out of the total 113 entry points to check the ground reality. They said that checkposts were put in place after the court passed an order asking them to visit.
Noting that the commission had passed an order to ban entry of trucks on Nov 18 but neither the transport department nor Delhi Police deployed their staff at entry point which was done only after SC passed direction on Nov 21, the bench directed the panel to invoke Section 14 of CAQM Act.

Section 14 says any noncompliance or contravention of any provisions of this Act, rules made thereunder or any order or direction issued by the Commission, shall be an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend up to five years or with fine which may extend up to one crore rupees or with both:
""It is apparent that the authorities which are mentioned against item numbers 1, 2 and 3 of stage IV of GRAP(state, transport & police commissioners) have made no earnest effort to implement the action in terms of clauses 1 - 3. Some police teams were deputed at a few entry points that also without any specific instruction. In fact the report of the court commissioner indicates that at most of the entry points the police were posted pursuant to the order of this court dated 22nd Nov. There is a serious lapse on the authorities mentioned against clauses 1 - 3. We therefore direct the commission to immediately initiate action in terms of section 14 of the CAQM Act,"" the court said.
The bench also directed NCR states to extend financial help to construction workers who face hardship due to ban on construction activities. It directed them to release labour cess funds to the affected workers.

Part of an initiative aimed at reducing air pollution in NCR, the order issued last week, states tax rebates will be available for six months between Sept 11 and March 10 next year with conditions applying to the scrapping process.
Last year too, the govt had come out with similar scheme, offering rebate on scrapping old vehicles for one-year period from March 11, 2023, to March 10, 2024.
Noida has nearly 1.5 lakh end-of-life vehicles, including 25,000 commercial vehicles that have not cleared their dues. Taxes for private vehicles are paid in one lump sum, while commercial vehicles are taxed quarterly, biannually, or annually.

Innovations like trans fats, air pollution, and microplastics, while initially beneficial for their respective industries, have emerged as significant threats to cardiovascular health.
Poll

This article explores how these man-made substances contribute to heart diseases, emphasizing the urgent need for mitigation and lifestyle changes.
1. Trans Fats: A Silent Threat to Heart Health
Trans fats, artificially created through the hydrogenation of vegetable oils, have been widely used in processed foods to enhance taste, texture, and shelf life. Despite their industrial advantages, trans fats pose severe health risks, particularly to the cardiovascular system.
Impact on Heart Health: Trans fats raise levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, commonly known as ""bad"" cholesterol, while simultaneously lowering high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or ""good"" cholesterol. This imbalance contributes to the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries, increasing the risk of coronary artery disease, heart attacks, and strokes. Moreover, trans fats can promote inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, further compounding heart disease risks.

Regulation and Reduction Efforts: In response to the overwhelming evidence of their harm, many countries have implemented regulations to reduce or eliminate trans fats from the food supply. However, trans fats still persist in some processed foods, particularly in areas with less stringent regulations.
2. Air Pollution: The Invisible Killer
Air pollution, primarily resulting from vehicle emissions, industrial activities, and the burning of fossil fuels, has become a pervasive global health issue. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and other pollutants infiltrate the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, posing a significant risk to heart health.


Impact on Heart Health: Chronic exposure to air pollution has been linked to an increased risk of heart attacks, hypertension, and arrhythmias. Pollutants like PM2.5 can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, causing systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and damage to blood vessels. This increases the likelihood of atherosclerosis (the hardening and narrowing of arteries), leading to cardiovascular complications.
Vulnerable Populations: Those living in urban areas, particularly in low-income communities near heavy traffic or industrial zones, are disproportionately affected. Air pollution not only aggravates existing heart conditions but also contributes to the early onset of heart disease in otherwise healthy individuals.
3. Microplastics: Emerging Threats to Heart Health
Microplastics, tiny plastic particles less than 5mm in size, have become ubiquitous in the environment due to the breakdown of larger plastic waste. They are found in oceans, soil, food, and even the air we breathe, leading to inadvertent ingestion and inhalation by humans.
Impact on Heart Health: Although research is still emerging, initial studies suggest that microplastics may contribute to cardiovascular diseases. Once inside the body, microplastics can induce inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, and endocrine disruption—all factors known to affect heart health. Microplastics may also carry toxic chemicals like phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), which have been associated with increased blood pressure and other heart disease risk factors.
Widespread Presence and Long-Term Effects: Microplastics have been detected in drinking water, seafood, and even table salt. The long-term implications of chronic exposure to microplastics are still being studied, but their potential to exacerbate heart conditions is a growing concern.

Combating the Threats: Mitigation and Prevention
Addressing the cardiovascular risks associated with trans fats, air pollution, and microplastics requires a multifaceted approach:
Regulatory Actions: Governments and regulatory bodies need to enforce stricter controls on trans fats in food products, reduce air pollution through cleaner energy sources, and limit plastic production and waste.
Public Awareness: Educating the public about the risks associated with these pollutants can empower individuals to make healthier lifestyle choices, such as reducing processed food intake, avoiding polluted areas, and supporting sustainable products.
Personal Health Measures: Individuals can take proactive steps to protect their heart health, such as maintaining a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and minimizing exposure to pollutants by using air purifiers and choosing eco-friendly products.
