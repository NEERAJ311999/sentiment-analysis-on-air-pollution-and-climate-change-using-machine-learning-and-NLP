Polluted air contains harmful substances like tiny particles, toxic gases, and heavy metals, which can enter the body through breathing and travel to the reproductive system. These pollutants may disrupt the production of healthy sperm, reduce their movement, and even damage their structure, making it harder for men to conceive. Additionally, air pollution can lead to hormonal imbalances and damage sperm DNA, which can impact fertility and even the health of future children."

This interruption deprives brain cells of oxygen and nutrients, causing them to die within minutes. Winter is associated with a higher risk of stroke due to physiological and environmental factors such as cold temperatures, increased blood pressure, and lifestyle changes during the season. Understanding these risks and taking preventive measures can reduce the likelihood of strokes in colder months. Read on as we discuss common causes of stroke in winter and how to prevent it."

This happens when abnormal cells start to grow uncontrollably. This causes tumours to exist which can in return interfere with the healthy and proper functioning of the lungs. In some cases, it can also further spread in the body (metastasis). Some common symptoms of lung cancer may include persistent coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. It can also affect the physical health of the person and reduce their breathing efficiency. This can further lower the overall energy levels. It can also affect mental health by causing stress and anxiety about the prognosis. Factors such as smoking, exposure to secondhand smoke, pollution, and genetic predisposition can increase one's risk of lung cancer. Unfortunately, there can be a lot of myth surrounding this condition. Read on as we share some common myths surrounding it and explain the facts."

When inhaled, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and other pollutants from vehicles, factories, and industrial sources can penetrate the respiratory system and enter the circulatory system. These pollutants can cause inflammation in blood vessels, promote plaque build-up, and lead to the hardening of arteries (atherosclerosis), increasing the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Over time, exposure to polluted air can elevate blood pressure, exacerbate arrhythmias, and impair heart rate variability, which is vital for heart health. Additionally, air pollution is linked to oxidative stress, where free radicals damage cells and tissues, further straining cardiovascular function. People with preexisting heart conditions, children, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of air pollution on the heart.

Seasonal transitions, especially from warmer to cooler weather, can weaken our immune system as the body adjusts to temperature fluctuations. Cold air also dries out the nasal passages and respiratory tract, which can reduce their natural defences against airborne pathogens. Air pollution compounds this vulnerability, as pollutants like particulate matter and toxins can irritate the respiratory system, making it easier for viruses and bacteria to penetrate and cause infections. Pollutants can also compromise the immune response, reducing the body's ability to fight off infections effectively. Together, changing weather and pollution create conditions that elevate the risk of respiratory illnesses, colds, and other infections.

Delayed sowing only means a shorter window to harvest and manage crop residue in already time-pressed states like Punjab, where farmers cultivate wheat immediately after paddy harvesting.
