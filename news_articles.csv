The decision, announced on Wednesday (January 15) by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), comes after a rapid deterioration in air quality across the region, pushing the Air Quality Index (AQI) into the 'Severe+' category.
If reports are to go by, all measures outlined in GRAP Stages I through IV will now be implemented without delay. Stage IV is the most stringent level of the action plan, and includes additional curbs aimed at mitigating pollution levels and preventing the AQI from worsening further.
Key restrictions:
BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel cars (4-wheelers) are restricted in Delhi and nearby NCR districts.
Medium and heavy diesel vehicles registered in Delhi (BS-IV and below) are banned, except those involved in essential services.
Light Commercial Vehicles from outside Delhi, except EVs, CNG, or BS-VI diesel, cannot enter the city unless carrying essential goods or services.
Trucks running on LNG, CNG, electric power, or BS-VI diesel are allowed to enter Delhi.
Truck entry into Delhi is prohibited, except for those carrying essential goods or services.

Education:
Physical classes may be suspended for all students, with possible exceptions for classes 10 and 12.

Work-from-home guidelines:
NCR state governments and the Delhi government may allow 50% of employees in government, municipal, and private offices to work remotely.
The central government will decide whether its employees can work from home.
The air quality in Delhi had shown signs of improvement earlier in January due to a spell of rainfall, prompting the CAQM to revoke Stage III restrictions on January 12. However, the respite was short-lived as pollutants surged again, particularly in the past week, necessitating the return of stricter controls.

This decision was prompted by a sharp decline in air quality in the city.
The India Meteorological Department and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology have predicted that the Air Quality Index (AQI) may soon breach the 400 mark, according to PTI. Consequently, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has instructed authorities in Delhi-NCR to ""straightway invoke"" all actions under stages 3 and 4 with immediate effect.
The Delhi Directorate of Education’s circular stated, ""All heads of government, government-aided, unaided private schools under DoE, NDMC, MCD, and the Delhi Cantonment Board are directed to conduct hybrid classes for students up to Class 9 and 11, wherever online learning is feasible, effective immediately until further notice,"" as reported by PTI.
For students of Classes 10 and 12, classes will continue to be held in schools. Stage 4 curbs include a ban on all construction activities and the entry of non-essential polluting trucks into Delhi.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution was responsible for nearly 4.2 million premature deaths in 2018 alone.
Although the connection between air pollution and serious respiratory and cardiovascular diseases is established, research continues to reveal other adverse effects of air pollution on brain health, especially in children and the elderly.
Effects on brain health
Exposure to polluted air for an extended period has increasingly been associated with neurodegenerative diseases like dementia. Short-term exposure has been associated with reduced daily productivity, declining attention spans particularly in children, and headaches.

Research studies involving MRI found that aging brains that had high concentrations of pollutants combined with fog show structural brain changes and atrophy. In the study of animals, such effects were detected before the condition develops to dementia. Researchers have found that air pollution also leads to neuron inflammation and oxidative stress, factors contributing to neurodegenerative disease and psychiatric illness such as anxiety and depression.
Short-term exposure health effects
Even brief exposure to polluted fog can result in noticeable health impacts, including:
Frequent headaches.
Reduced concentration and attention span.
Difficulty focusing on tasks.
Steps to Mitigate Health Risks
To address the health hazards posed by air pollution and fog, both collective and individual actions are essential:
Public and policy-level measures
Reduce emissions by promoting eco-friendly public transportation.
Limit the burning of garbage and agricultural waste.
Enforce stricter regulations on vehicles and industries to curb pollution.
Personal Protective Measures
Wear mask with filters for fine particulate if air quality is bad
Outdoor recreation may need to be limited on extremely polluted days
Ensure proper ventilation within indoor space and add HEPA cleaners
Follow antioxidant and anti-inflammatory diet high in such things as leafy greens, berries and fish in support of a healthy brain
Call to action
With increased pollution by air and compounded by fog, the danger to public health has increased alarmingly. This requires a combined approach by governments, industries, and people to reduce the risks and protect vulnerable groups. It can be achieved by implementing preventive measures and enhancing cleaner environments that reduce the long-term health impact and increase overall well-being.

4,Times of India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/air-pollution-alarming-at-multiple-locations/articleshow/117093827.cms,Air pollution alarming at multiple locations,,"Mumbai: For a major part of November and December 2024, pollution was higher than the standard prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) in at least 12 out of 30 locations where PM2.5 and PM10 levels were monitored.
NGO Watavaran analysed air quality data for Mumbai from Nov 1 to Dec 31 last year. For PM2.5, 60ug/m3 is the safe limit and for PM10 it is 100ug/m3. Monitoring units have been put up at the 30 locations by govt agencies, including the BMC and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board.
Borivali East, which encompasses the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, and Malad West experienced hazardous air quality levels for 90% of the monitored period, while Bandra-Kurla Complex and Navy Nagar in Colaba exceeded safety limits for 87% of the monitored days, said Bhagwan Kesbhat, CEO, Watavaran.
Other areas which experienced high pollution levels for over 60% of the days monitored include Byculla (67% of the days), Deonar (74%), Ghatkopar (79%), Kandivali (82%), Chembur (84%) and Kherwadi in Bandra East (80%).
Kesbhat said industrial activity due to the presence of oil refineries and a thermal power station within the city limits was one of the reasons for high pollution levels in Chembur and Deonar. Construction, vehicular emissions, and bakeries and restaurants using wood for burning were among the reasons at other locations. Navy Nagar, Colaba has seen a significant rise in vehicular traffic, he said.
Mohsin Khan, senior project officer, Watavaran, said the current cool weather in Mumbai meant there was no wind circulation, resulting in particulate matter hanging in the air. ""The unseasonal rains in the second week of December helped bring down the pollution levels, providing temporary relief, but the overall trend remains deeply concerning,"" he said.
Khan said the findings are worrying because PM 2.5 particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream, posing severe health risks to residents. ""The persistent high levels we are seeing across multiple locations indicate a systemic problem that requires immediate intervention,"" he said.
Kesbhat said the MPCB and the BMC must develop location-specific action plans for high-risk areas and ensure strict enforcement of dust control measures at construction sites."

American tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson, famous for his anti-aging ventures, has been making headlines as of late due to his reactions toward the India air pollution crisis. Via X tweet, Johnson stated that using the imagination in applying solutions to the problem of air pollution in India might have a greater effect on increasing life expectancy than finding a cure for cancer. His statement highlighted the grave environmental challenge India is facing, and he also gave practical advice on how to minimize exposure to pollution.
Bryan Johnson's involvement in India's air pollution discussion highlights the interconnected nature of environmental and health issues. By promoting solutions like air purifiers and N96 masks, he stresses the need for immediate actions in polluted environments.
Bryan Johnson shares solutions to combat pollution in India

In the video accompanying his tweet, Johnson's associate explained the measures they took during their stay in Mumbai to minimize the effects of poor air quality. To track the air quality, they carried a portable device so that they were aware of the pollution levels around them. They avoided exposure to the unhealthy air by not visiting the gym because of its poor air quality. They kept car windows shut, relied on air conditioning in their rooms to circulate clean air, and wore N96 masks when they ventured outside. His colleague even carried portable air filters wherever they went to make sure that fresh air was constantly available to counter the pollution that was being constantly thrown their way.

Johnson highlighted air pollution's impact on health and life expectancy

Johnson's tweet and video offered not just solutions but also highlighted the severity of air pollution in India. He said that more health benefits would come from efforts by the country to fight air pollution than from the discovery of a cure for cancer. The comparison serves to underscore the imperative of urgent action, since air pollution is a silent killer affecting millions of people in India, cutting their life expectancy short and causing all sorts of health problems. The message of Johnson is a wake-up call for this issue on a national scale to save more lives.
Mixed reactions to Bryan Johnson's measures advised

Some people on Twitter found some of the protective measures he advised to be over-the-top, such as carrying a portable air purifier. A user even proposed some more practical policy changes: installing air filters in all businesses, more public campaigns on mask use, planting more trees, and giving subsidies to electric vehicles to reduce pollution. This is a growing sentiment for systemic change in tackling the pollution problem.
The comment by other users about taking pollution seriously is to say that fresh air is a right and not a privilege. It points out that air pollution, besides being a health issue, also relates to socioeconomic aspects wherein the vulnerable section of the population cannot access even temporary solutions.

If all cars and commercial vehicles in the city are converted to electric vehicles, emissions will reduce by nearly a quarter, the study said.
Contrary to the belief that the real estate sector contributes the highest percentage of dust, the NIAS research revealed that the transport industry contributes to 39.1% — the highest — of the annual emissions of PM 2.5, followed by the industrial sector (24.2%) and road dust (13.7%). Similarly, road dust (34.3%) contributes in a big way to PM 10 emission, followed by the transport (23.7%) and industrial sectors (17.3%).
Dr Gufran Beig, chair professor, NIAS, revealed that the overwhelming presence of two-wheelers in Bengaluru is a major factor in transport-related emissions. ""The relatively low number of buses suggests a potential need for strengthening public transportation to reduce Bengaluru's reliance on private vehicles. Besides, the city also has a higher percentage of older cars compared to a relatively younger fleet of two-wheelers and three-wheelers, contributing considerably to these pollutants in the regular air,"" he said.
Referring to the ongoing debate on these pollutants, Dr Beig pointed out that everyone has failed to understand the dimensions of pollutants. ""Whenever we talk about these pollutants, we only talk about their size; nobody talks about the toxicity of these particles. A smaller toxic particle of PM 2.5 or PM 10 can also cause as much harm as a large quantity of these particulate matter. Most of these toxic particles are exhausted after burning fossil fuels such as petrol and diesel. Switching to EV is the solution,"" he said.

Given the worsening air quality of Bengaluru, the researchers tried addressing the situation by replacing conservative vehicles with EVs for estimating reduction in annual emissions. ""Despite the large volume of cars on city roads, converting all of them into EVs would only reduce emissions by 7.6%. But the fact lies in commercial vehicles and buses. If all of them were to be converted into EVs, it would bring down emissions by a whopping 21.8% and reduce the per capita healthcare cost in the city,"" Dr Beig explained.
Asked about the reluctance among motorists to switch to EVs, he said, ""Any innovation comes with its own set of challenges. We all need to work towards addressing those challenges rather than retreating. I agree that transition to EVs is plagued by problems, including insufficient infrastructure, lack of framework for safe disposal of batteries, and sustained durability of charge. But given our expertise in various fields, these can be resolved. Also, nothing is as important as our health. If these transitions are going to benefit our health in the long run, it's time we initiated the change.
Could have healthcare implications too
The per capita healthcare spending of the average Bengalurean increased by a staggering Rs 3,310 in 2023 alone, according to the NIAS study. It also revealed that Bengalureans suffered crores of rupees in losses in the form of premature deaths, morbid conditions, and prolonged ailments.
But can this be reversed? Experts, led by Dr Gufran Beig, revealed that a planned transition from diesel and petrol vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs) would considerably bring down healthcare expenses of Bengaluru, which are largely rising thanks to air pollution.
""If all vehicles, especially light commercial vehicles and buses, switch over to EVs, the per capita healthcare cost is likely to come down by at least Rs 2,008.4 a year,"" explained Dr Beig, while taking into consideration the cost of hospital admission, consultation, procedures, tests, and pharmacy expenses."

Dikshit, who is contesting from the New Delhi constituency against former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, listed various achievements of the earlier Congress govt under Sheila Dikshit in transport, infrastructure, and sewage management.
The Congress functionary is the son of the late Delhi chief minister, Sheila Dikshit.
""The DTC fleet has shrunk from around 5,500 buses during Congress govt to just around 3,000 buses now as Kejriwal has taken no step to enhance the DTC fleet in the past 10 years. Due to corruption in the maintenance of DTC buses, breakdowns have become a regular feature,"" he said.

He added that it was the responsibility of Delhi govt to clean up the air without giving excuses, ""though Kejriwal has only excuses to offer.""
The Congress candidate said that the setting up of more gas-based power plants was first started by the previous Congress govt in Bawana, which was another step taken to combat air pollution.
""Just by blaming Haryana and UP and stubble burning, Kejriwal has been trying to cover up his incompetence and inaction through tutored data and blatant lies. Stubble burning existed for decades, but the main cause for Delhi's air pollution was a sharp spike in vehicles on the roads in the absence of a robust public transport system and severe erosion of the green cover,"" Dikshit said.
Talking about the constituency, Dikshit said: ""People in the New Delhi constituency are very dissatisfied. I have been campaigning on the ground, and there is hardly any work done by Kejriwal, besides a few benches and dysfunctional CCTV cameras. Everyone is complaining about the poor quality of water, even in areas like NDMC, where it is hard to imagine problems of such basic facilities.""
Congress officials added that in the past few years, no new sewage treatment plant has been constructed by AAP govt. ""It was only by 2021-22, after the intervention of the courts, that three new STPs are being constructed, according to a DJB report submitted to the LG. Accumulated losses of DJB are at Rs 76,000 crore due to corruption and mismanagement by the Kejriwal govt,"" Dikshit said.
The Congress contestant from New Delhi said that his party has a plan to clean up the Yamuna and reduce air pollution.
""During Congress govt, several big flyovers were planned and constructed. We looked at road widening and traffic jam patterns and then, in a planned manner, rolled out projects. The blueprint will be applied in Delhi.""
AAP is yet to respond to Dikshit's allegations."

However, a study using spider cobwebs here reveals that there are at least 12 heavy metals, some of which are toxic in nature, present in the air. Breathing this air is not just bad for lungs, but doctors say it affects brain and other organs over time.
Scientific studies indicate that excessive levels of lead, for instance, are toxic to nervous system and blood, while cadmium increases cancer risk, kidney damage and weakening of bones.
The most vulnerable are chronic asthma patients and those susceptible to respiratory infections. ""Also, there is concern about bioaccumulation of heavy metals within human tissue,"" said IMA-Kochi spokesperson Dr Rajeev Jayadevan.

For the study, samples were collected from public places like bus stands, shops and buildings that had not cleared cobwebs for a long time. Researchers decided to study spider webs due to their ability to trap pollutants passively.
""Spider webs possess the remarkable ability to capture and accumulate a range of airborne pollutants, including particulate matter (PM), heavy metals and even microplastics. Their sticky and durable nature allows webs to passively trap pollutants for extended periods, acting as a natural filter for environmental contaminants,"" said senior scientist at Centre for Arachnology Research, Bharata Mata College, Mathew M Joseph, who conducted the study with his student Archana Anil of Sacred Heart College.
They presented the study findings at the eighth conference of Asian Society of Arachnology, held in Wuhan, China, recently.
Presence of heavy metal concentration was higher at urban sites like Thevara and industrial areas like FACT and least at the suburbs of Kizhakkambalam.
Researchers plan to use spider webs to study pollutants, including micro and nanoplastics and other nanopollutants in the atmosphere."

Patna: The ambient air in Buxar with an air quality index (AQI) of 293, categorised as ""poor"", remained worse than Delhi for the third consecutive day on Saturday. Delhi's AQI was recorded at 255 on Saturday, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). However, only six other cities in the state, including Patna, experienced poor air quality during this period.
Other cities with poor air quality on the day included Patna (238), Hajipur (226), Araria (222), Begusarai (217), Muzaffarpur (204) and Aurangabad (202). The AQI for five other places — Bettiah, Darbhanga, Kishanganj, Motihari, and Rajgir — could not be calculated due to insufficient data, as per CPCB.
The AQI measures air quality, reflecting pollutants like particulate matter (PM 2.5 and PM 10) that pose health risks. Health experts have long warned against prolonged exposure, saying that higher AQI levels can worsen conditions for asthma patients and those with respiratory problems, leading to pulmonary issues and, in extreme cases, lung cancer.
According to the CPCB website, air in the ""poor"" range (201-300) can cause breathing discomfort on long-term exposure. AQI in the ""very poor"" range (301-400) can lead to respiratory illnesses while prolonged exposure to ""severe"" air (401-500) may damage even healthy individuals and severely impact those with existing diseases or comorbidities."

Air foul along route: Survey,,"Mumbai: As the city prepares for the Tata Mumbai Marathon (TMM) 2025, the air that thousands of participants will breathe on Sunday may not be satisfactory. Just 48 hours before the annual mega running event, a survey conducted by an environmental group on Friday morning found pollution levels along the route very high and breaching safety limits.
Thanks to the smoggy conditions prevailing due to the winter chill brought in by northerly winds, the speed of the sea breeze, which otherwise drives away the smog, was reduced.
On Friday, between 5am and 8.27am, volunteers of Awaaz Foundation used a sensor-based monitor to record PM2.5 particulate matter to check pollution levels at eight spots along the marathon route. None of the locations had particulate matter levels within limits considered ‘safe' by the authorities, Awaaz Foundation claimed. The routes of both the full (42.19km) and half (21.09km) marathons cover the stretch between the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus in south Mumbai and Bandra in the western suburbs.
In a letter to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and BMC, Awaaz Foundation's convenor Sumaira Abdulali said the highest pollution level of 154 micrograms per cubic metre was found at Mahim Reti Bunder, not far from the starting point of the half marathon in which 15,000 runners would be participating on Sunday. The lowest level of 95 micrograms per cubic metre was found at Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan Road in central Mumbai, the letter said, adding that as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) norms, the safe limit for PM2.5 is 60 micrograms for 24 hours.

Under Stage 3, the use of BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel cars (4-wheelers) is restricted in Delhi and nearby NCR districts. Persons with disabilities are exempt. Stage 3 also bans non-essential diesel-operated medium goods vehicles with BS-IV or older standards in Delhi.
During winters, the Delhi-NCR region enforces restrictions under GRAP, which categorizes air quality into four stages - Stage 1 (Poor, AQI 201-300), Stage 2 (Very Poor, AQI 301-400), Stage 3 (Severe, AQI 401-450), and Stage 4 (Severe Plus, AQI above 450).

In the current day we wake up to our air purifiers, smartphones warning us that the air quality is in the ‘very poor’ or ‘hazardous’ category. Whether schools, offices and going out will be physical or online, it all now depends on the quality of the air on a given day. The Air Quality Index, always fluctuating between 300-600, wasn’t a common phenomenon 30 years back. Even the discussion around air or air quality wasn’t a household thing.
While Delhi’s air quality is the biggest issue we discuss in our day-to-day lives now – online classes, working from home on account of pollution, people gifting air purifiers to each other on Diwali, kids taking inhalers to schools wasn’t something people in the ’90s thought of.

Dr Arvind Kumar, Chairman, Lung Transplant, Medanta, Gurugram, moved to Delhi in 1976. The 66-year-old says that until 2004-2006, nobody spoke about air quality. “The term AQI
came into our lives in 2014. Nobody in Delhi was talking about air or air quality 30 years back. It wasn’t the best back then, but it wasn’t the way it is today either. Things like nebulisers, air purifiers and masks in day-to-day use, were nonexistent. When my children were growing up in Delhi in 2000, on the AIIMS campus, we needed nebulisers. That was a subtle change. But masks and air purifiers are all a post 2014-2015 phenomenon. The routine monitoring of air started around 1995. The forecasting and reporting on air quality started around 2014 and now we have real-time information on our air purifiers and AQI,” shares the doctor.
""The biggest change that we have seen in our practice of respiratory medicine is the awareness about lung diseases that pollution can cause, and nowadays we see
many patients walking to us in the OPD and enquiring about their lung health and the adverse effect pollution is causing,” says Dr Puneet Khanna, HOD and Consultant, Pulmonology, HCMCT Manipal Hospitals, Dwarka.
This is what we are breathing currently

‘Anyone who breathes - a newborn or an elderly - smokes 15-20 cigarettes in Oct-Nov in Delhi’
“As per a formula 22 microgram of PM2.5 is equal to 1 cigarette. So, when the PM2.5 level is at 400, mostly in Oct-Nov these days, it is equivalent to smoke of 15-20 cigarettes a day. I say that during Oct-Nov when PM2.5 is at 350-400, it is like smoking that number of cigarettes by anyone who breathes. That includes newborns to elderly. When I operate on teenagers, I see black deposits in their lungs, too, which was unheard of 30 years back,” says Dr Arvind Kumar.

‘The 90s saw a less crowded, greener Delhi, with fewer vehicles, and sparrows in its parks’
The 1990s saw a less crowded, greener Delhi, with fewer vehicles, minimal construction, and an abundance of sparrows in its parks. Still, the city’s skyline was dominated by the smokeemitting chimneys of the Indraprastha and Rajghat power stations, along with a Badarpur Power station on the capital’s outskirts. The air was thick with soot, and vehicles belched black smoke as a common sight. Riding a scooter for a few kilometres left burning red eyes and a black layer of soot on white shirts. 30 years ago, Delhi took its first significant step to combat air pollution by adopting CNG
– Mohan George, Consultant, Clean Air & Sustainable Mobility, Center for Science and Environment (and Ex. Additional Director at Delhi Pollution Control Committee)
Switching to CNG was a significant step in mitigating air pollution in the 90s
Air quality might once have been an unfamiliar term, but the choking haze of pollution was an undeniable reality even in the mid-90s. Anumita Roychowdhury, Executive Director for Research and Advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, shares, ""When our Right to Clean Air Campaign was initiated in 1996, Delhi’s choking haze of pollution was visibly black. But there was barely any data to piece together the pollution jigsaw and to see through the smokescreen. Authorities could easily dismiss the problem of particulate matter as ‘natural dust’. We used photos of black human lungs as warheads to provoke a response. Despite these odds, we have seen massive energy changeover, with public and commercial transport moving from diesel to CNG and industrial areas switching from coal, pet coke and furnace oil to natural gas in Delhi. These were tough battles."" She adds, ""I still recall the April 5, 2002 directive of the Supreme Court, upholding the Right to Life, that declined to dilute the 1998 CNG order and imposed a penalty for non-compliance. Delhi’s first action phase was driven by desperation and the urgency for immediate relief. Yet despite the initial gains, air quality is far from the clean benchmark.""
""Even after switching to CNG it feels like we keep returning to square one when it comes to pollution. My daughter was born in ’95 and my son was born in ’97. Even in the ’90s, the air was bad enough for the doctor to warn me, during both pregnancies, that my placenta resembled that of a heavy smoker, due to pollution. She advised me to stay indoors,"" adds Swapna Liddle, historian and author."

Chandigarh: Amid escalating concerns over air pollution, the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) has issued a formal notice to the MC commissioner due to ongoing instances of waste burning throughout the city, despite previous warnings.
The CPCC has issued strict instructions to the civic body, demanding immediate action to prevent waste burning across Chandigarh and enforce penalties against violators. The notice said, ""Despite notices by CPCC and instructions of the chief secretary during the review meeting of NGT matter 606/2018 that nowhere in Chandigarh should waste be burnt and strict action should be taken against defaulters, waste is still being burnt in various places in Chandigarh, more specifically in Sector 53, where it is regularly noticed that waste is being burnt on an almost daily basis.""
The situation worsened when the MC was found disposing of unprocessed solid waste in vacant areas in Sector 53. Following TOI's coverage and UT chief secretary's intervention, senior MC officials acted to stop the dumping, yet the burning of existing waste continued.
The notice additionally said, ""Waste is being burnt at the backside of the Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring station, Sector 53, in an open field, creating a very bad impact on air quality."" The CPCC had previously advised the MC to address this issue in October 2024.

The waste burning significantly affects the city's air quality. The CPCC noted that winter conditions have already compromised air quality, necessitating the Graded Action Response Plan. The committee emphasised that waste burning further deteriorates air quality, endangering residents' health.
Should the MC fail to address these violations following the CPCC notice and administration directives, the committee may implement environmental compensation penalties against the corporation."

The drizzle brought much-needed relief from the pollution levels that saw a steep surge on Wednesday when the AQI was recorded at a 'poor' reading of 270, a jump of over 100 points from Tuesday's 156.
The relief, however, is temporary, warned experts. According to forecasts, unfavourable meteorological conditions for the dispersion of pollutants may push the AQI into the 'poor' or 'very poor' category in the coming days.
Stages III and IV of GRAP were invoked on Wednesday after a spike in AQI. GRAP-IV, however, was revoked across NCR on Thursday due to better air conditions. Restrictions under stages I, II, and III, will continue to remain in force.
Among the city's monitoring stations, Gwalpahari saw the worst AQI with a 'poor' reading of 225. Vikas Sadan and Sector 51 recorded 117 and 146, respectively -- both 'moderate'. This data was unavailable at the Teri Gram monitoring station.

According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the ventilation index (measure of the atmosphere's ability to disperse pollutants) is lower than the required 6000 m²/s. The average wind speed, less than 10 km/h, adds to poor pollutant dispersion.
""The predominant surface wind is likely to flow from the north with a speed of less than 4kmph during morning hours. Smog or moderate fog in most places and dense fog in isolated areas is likely in the morning. The wind speed may reach 8-10kmph from the northwest during the afternoon, but it will decrease and go below 6kmph during the evening and night,"" Safar stated.
The particulate matter levels remain highly concerning. Sector 51 recorded a PM2.5 level of 326 µg/m³, nearly 21 times higher than the World Health Organization's (WHO) safe limit of 15 µg/m³. It was followed by Gwalpahari (321 µg/m³) and Vikas Sadan at 253 µg/m³.
PM10 levels were also the worst at Gwalpahari at 177 µg/m³ — nearly four times WHO's safe threshold of 45 µg/m³. Sector 51 measured 169 µg/m³ and Vikas Sadan 144 µg/m³. Both the PM2.5 and PM10 were not recorded at Teri Gram.
The Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) annual safe limit is 60 µg/m³ for PM2.5 and 100 µg/m³ for PM10.
""Keeping in view its disruptive nature impacting a large number of stakeholders and public at large and with significant improvement in the average AQI also considering abrupt fluctuations in the meteorological factors, the GRAP sub-committee however decides to revoke Stage-IV of extant GRAP schedule in the entire NCR at this stage, with immediate effect,"" the CAQM order read."

Overcast skies pull max temp down sharply
Fog is expected to continue in the region, with the met department issuing a ‘yellow’ (be aware) alert for Thursday to Saturday for moderate to dense fog. Some areas received light rain in the evening.
R K Jenamani, senior IMD scientist, said visibility was in the range of 100-150 metres (dense fog) since 5.30am on Wednesday. “Dense fog intensified late morning on Wednesday with general visibility reducing to zero from 8.30am at both Safdarjung and IGI Airport. visibility dropped due to calm wind conditions and a stable surface atmospheric boundary layer. Easterly winds brought moisture which intensified the foggy conditions. Zero visibility with very dense fog conditions persisted at both Safdarjung and IGI Airport till 11.30 am,” said Jenamani.
This was the first time this season that dense fog had extended beyond 9.30am in the city, he said. By 12.30pm, visibility improved to 250-400 metres. Because of its persistence till late morning, Wednesday’s fog spell had a major impact on road, rail and air traffic. However, the most intense dense fog in terms of duration this season was recorded on Jan 4-5, which lasted for nearly nine hours from 11.30pm to 8.30am, according to IMD’s data.
Overcast skies during the day brought down the maximum temperature from 21.2 degrees Celsius on Tuesday to 18.1 degrees C, two notches below normal. The minimum temperature dipped to six degrees C, one degree below normal, compared to 8.9 degrees C a day earlier. Met department’s data shows that Palam, Pusa and Najafgarh recorded 0.5 mm rainfall each from 5.30pm to 8.30pm.
“There are chances of very light rain on Wednesday night and Thursday morning under the influence of a western disturbance. Another spell of very light to light rain is expected on Jan 21 night,” said a Met official. The fog spell is likely to continue."

The senior IAS officer, who is ACS transport, referred to a video conference of Jan 4 under the chairmanship of the PM's advisor, Tarun Kapoor, in which the chairman of Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) made a presentation on the subject.
The presentation was based on a Jan 2023 report by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), which said agricultural residue burning contributes 1% to PM 2.5 and PM10 levels in Delhi. This finding was displayed in a slide labeled ‘Sectoral Contribution of Sources of NCR to Particulate Matter'. Khemka's note, titled ‘Management of Air Pollution in NCR', was sent on Jan 10. According to the TERI report Khemka referred to, road dust contributes 42% to PM10 levels in Delhi annually while transport contributes 25%. Transport accounts for 47% of PM 2.5 emissions and road dust 20%. There is a higher contribution of dust sources to PM10 in summer (38-42%) compared to winter (23-31%). It's the same for PM 2.5 (31-34% in summer to 15% in winter).

However, while the ACS stresses the importance of having a strategy to contain vehicular pollution, farm fire emissions cannot be compared to vehicular or any other pollution source that is an all-year phenomenon.
Farm fires are seasonal, happening within a window between Sept 1 and Nov 30. So, their share in an annual metric will always be small. Besides, during the peak season for farm fires, their share in the capital's pollution levels are much, much higher than 1%.
According to the Decision Support System (DSS) for air quality management in Delhi, which has been used to monitor the contribution of farm fires to the capital's PM 2.5 levels, stubble burning's contribution touched 35% on Nov 1 last year.
Every winter, air quality in Delhi-NCR plummets to hazardous levels as the airshed fills up with toxic haze which is triggered by a combination of pollutants, fog, lack of winds and other meteorological factors. Farm fires, commonly seen in north India's agricultural belt to clear tracts of land for another round of sowing after the paddy harvest, become a major compounding factor when added to local sources.
Shubhansh Tiwari, research associate at Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), told TOI: ""Agricultural residue burning's overall contribution is small compared to other sources as it occurs for a limited period. The issue needs to be addressed because, during the 45 days when farmers clear their fields, meteorological conditions carry the smoke into NCR. Nevertheless, road dust and vehicular emissions remain primary contributors to particulate matter in Delhi-NCR and effective management of these sources, especially during the summer months when dust levels are higher, is crucial for improving air quality. So what we need is a holistic approach that addresses all significant pollution sources."""

Kolkata: The city experienced significant fluctuations in its air quality index (AQI) on Monday, with some monitoring stations recovering through the day from the bad air conditions on Sunday. The Rabindra Bharati University (RBU) air quality station on B T Road emerged as the city's most polluted zone, recording AQI levels that consistently fell within the ‘poor' category (AQI: 201-300). In contrast, Rabindra Sarobar and Victoria Memorial Hall stations showed improvement as the day progressed.
The RBU station, which has historically maintained the best air quality in the city, recorded a steep rise in pollution levels, peaking at 275 AQI by 7 pm. This marks a significant departure from its usual status, as it managed to maintain ‘moderate' air quality (AQI: 101-200) even when other stations plunged into the poor range earlier this year.
Jadavpur, which recorded poor air quality on Sunday, showed notable recovery to the ‘moderate' category on Monday. The AQI at Jadavpur started at 189 in the morning, dipped to 174 by midday, and rose slightly to 191 by evening.
In south Kolkata, Ballygunge's air quality worsened steadily over the day. It began with an AQI of 261 at 5 am and peaked at 263 by 7 pm, marking it as one of the most polluted zones. However, nearby Rabindra Sarobar saw its AQI improve from 174 in the morning to 153 by evening, maintaining moderate air quality. Victoria Memorial Hall recorded a decline in AQI from 272 at 5 am to 217 by 7 pm, indicating marginal improvement, though it was still within the poor range.

The civic body initially planned to install the sensors in association with IIT-Kanpur and then, considering logistical issues, pursued a tie-up with IIT-Bombay. However, with a delayed response from IIT-Bombay, the BMC sought a fresh proposal from IIT-Kanpur.
A fresh proposal was given by IIT-Kanpur Professor Sachchida Nand Tripathi, a professor of civil engineering and sustainable energy engineering, and his team, which includes start-ups. ""We are examining the proposal,"" said a civic official. ""The elements of the fresh proposal are not significantly different from the earlier one,"" said an official. The installation of the hyperlocal air quality monitoring units is expected to cost around Rs 13 crore.
""The earlier plan was to install 250 sensors across the city. However, the BMC now intends to install about 75 sensors, and the city will be divided into equal-sized grids of about eight square kilometres. The sensor-based air quality monitoring units would be set up at each of these grids. The monitoring units are expected to help BMC in measuring air quality at granular hyperlocal levels,"" said an official.

The panel also urged that, ""While GRAP Stage-III is being revoked, keeping in view the winter season when weather conditions may not always be favorable, and in order to ensure that the AQI levels do not slip further, citizens are requested to strictly adhere to the citizen charter under GRAP-II.""
""The Sub-Committee shall be keeping a close watch on the air quality scenario and reviewing the situation from time to time for further appropriate decisions depending upon the Air Quality in Delhi and forecasts made by IMD/IITM,"" it further read.

Stage-III measures, reinstated on Thursday, prohibit non-essential construction work. Schools up to grade five are allowed to offer hybrid learning (online and in-person). BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel four-wheelers, excluding those used by people with disabilities, are also restricted while older diesel-powered medium goods vehicles are banned in Delhi under Stage III.
The GRAP outlines four stages of air quality: Stage I (Poor), Stage II (Very Poor), Stage III (Severe), and Stage IV (Severe Plus). Another weather system is expected to impact northwest India around January 14-15. Winter air pollution in the Delhi-NCR region is caused by a combination of weather patterns, vehicle exhaust, agricultural burning, fireworks, and other local sources."

The Air Quality Index (AQI) has soared past 150 across multiple localities, marking the season's worst pollution levels. Concentrations of harmful pollutants, including PM 2.5, PM 10, and NO2, have spiked alarmingly, with some areas reporting levels up to 100 times higher than the World Health Organisation's (WHO) recommended limits.
Localities such as Sanath Nagar, Somajiguda, Gachibowli, Kokapet, Punjagutta, and Old City are among the worst affected. Sanath Nagar recorded PM 2.5 levels of 500 µg/m³, a 100 times higher than the WHO guideline of 5 µg/m³. Similarly, Somajiguda reported 280 µg/m³, while Kokapet, Kompally, and Ramachandrapuram exceeded 200 µg/m³. PM 10 levels were equally alarming, with ECIL registering 204 µg/m³, followed by Gachibowli (160 µg/m³) and Old City (158 µg/m³).
The deteriorating air quality has triggered a spike in respiratory illnesses, with cases of asthma, chronic coughs, and lung infections surging across the city.
Highlighted the dire health implications, Dr Tejas Jogi, a pulmonologist said, ""Pollution levels are rising year-round, but winter magnifies the impact. Temperature inversion traps pollutants close to the ground, worsening conditions. PM 2.5 particles penetrate deep into the lungs, weakening immunity and increasing risks of respiratory infections like pneumonia and bronchitis.""

Between 2008 and 2020, Hyderabad recorded an annual average of 5,552 deaths linked to air pollution, with 1,597 fatalities reported in 2023 alone, making it the sixth deadliest city in India for pollution-related deaths. Vulnerable groups, especially children with developing lungs, are at heightened risk.
Environmental experts point to temperature inversion as a key factor exacerbating winter air pollution. Padmaja K, a pollution researcher in Hyderabad, said, ""During the night, the ground cools rapidly, trapping cooler air beneath a warmer layer and preventing pollutants from dispersing. Weak winter winds further slow the process, allowing pollutants to accumulate.""
Experts underscore the urgent need for strengthening public transport, promoting cycling and walking, phasing out old vehicles, and cracking down on adulterated fuels are seen as critical steps. Improved traffic management, stricter monitoring of industrial emissions, and regulation of construction activities are also essential, experts pointed out.
""Simple measures, like installing curtains around construction sites and sprinkling water to reduce dust, can make a big difference,"" said environmentalist Bhaskar Reddy. He added, ""We can't eliminate pollution entirely, but controlling it is within our reach. Enforcing existing laws and penalising violators are crucial to curb pollution and slow climate change."""

While its impacts on respiratory and cardiovascular health are well-documented, its effects on vision and eye health are often overlooked. With cities like Delhi facing hazardous air quality levels year-round, it is essential to understand how polluted air affects the eyes in both the short and long term.
Immediate effects of air pollution on vision
Air pollution can cause a range of immediate discomforts and symptoms in the eyes. Redness, irritation, and a burning sensation are among the most common complaints. These issues arise because pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and toxic gases like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide come into direct contact with the eye's surface.
Dry eye syndrome, a condition where the eyes fail to produce sufficient tears or the tears evaporate too quickly, is also closely linked to air pollution. Pollutants disrupt the tear film, the natural protective layer of the eye, leaving the eyes feeling gritty, itchy, and prone to infections. Additionally, many individuals experience allergic reactions, such as conjunctivitis, which causes swelling, itching, and watery discharge.

Long-term impact on eye health
While immediate discomfort is alarming, the long-term consequences of air pollution on vision are even more concerning. Chronic exposure to polluted air has been associated with several serious eye conditions:
1. Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
AMD is a leading cause of vision loss among individuals over the age of 50. Research shows that fine particulate matter, particularly PM2.5, can accelerate the onset of AMD by causing oxidative stress and inflammation in the retina. People living in urban areas with poor air quality are at a significantly higher risk.

2. Cataracts
Cataracts, a condition where the natural lens of the eye becomes cloudy, impairing vision, have also been linked to air pollution. Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, combined with pollutants, accelerates the development of cataracts. This issue is especially prevalent in countries like India, where outdoor workers are disproportionately exposed to both pollution and sunlight.
3. Glaucoma
Emerging research suggests that pollution may contribute to glaucoma, a group of conditions that damage the optic nerve and can lead to permanent blindness. High levels of air pollution are believed to elevate intraocular pressure, one of the main risk factors for glaucoma, further underscoring the need for vigilance.
Delhi’s air pollution crisis
Delhi, infamous for its hazardous air quality, provides a case study on how pollution impacts vision. In November 2024, the city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) hit 484—classified as ""severe plus."" During such episodes, hospitals and clinics report a sharp rise in cases of eye irritation, dry eye syndrome, and allergic conjunctivitis. The dense smog not only obscures visibility but also worsens eye conditions, particularly for individuals with pre-existing sensitivities.
How to protect your eyes from air pollution
Protecting your eyes amidst rising pollution levels requires adopting preventive measures:
1. Wear protective eyewear: Sunglasses or goggles act as a barrier against pollutants and UV radiation.
2. Practice eye hygiene: Regularly rinsing your eyes with clean water helps remove irritants and reduce discomfort.
3. Use artificial tears: Over-the-counter lubricating eye drops can help maintain moisture in your eyes and prevent dryness.
4. Limit outdoor activities: Avoid venturing outdoors during peak pollution hours, typically early morning and late evening.
5. Maintain indoor air quality: Using air purifiers at home can reduce exposure to indoor air pollutants.
Government and community efforts to mitigate pollution
Authorities have taken steps to combat the alarming levels of pollution. Measures like halting construction activities, restricting the use of older diesel vehicles, and closing schools during severe pollution days aim to reduce exposure. However, long-term solutions require a collective effort. Public awareness campaigns, stricter emission controls, and green urban initiatives, such as tree planting, are essential.
Why vision protection matters
The eyes are among the most sensitive organs in the body, and their health can deteriorate rapidly under adverse conditions. Protecting your vision is not just about addressing immediate discomfort but also about preventing long-term damage. With pollution levels showing no signs of abating, individual efforts to protect eye health must go hand in hand with systemic reforms to improve air quality.
Air pollution’s effects on vision are both immediate and long-lasting. From minor irritation to irreversible conditions like AMD and glaucoma, the risks are significant. While individual precautions can alleviate short-term symptoms, a sustainable solution to the pollution crisis is essential to safeguard public health. As the nation continues to urbanize, addressing air pollution must remain a top priority to ensure a healthier future for generations to come.

What does the study say?

Researchers from University College London (UCL) analyzed health records of 3,600 airport neighbors and 21,300 people who don’t live near a flight path to examine the effects of substantial and moderate aircraft commotion compared to no noise.
The residents exposed to worse racket, especially at night, had stiffer and thicker heart muscles that doubled or quadrupled their risk of a heart attack, life-threatening heart rhythm or stroke, the researchers said.
Senior study author and cardiologist Dr. Gaby Captur, said, “Our study is observational so we cannot say with certainty that high levels of aircraft noise caused these differences in heart structure and function.”
He added, “However, our findings add to a growing body of evidence that aircraft noise can adversely affect heart health and our health more generally.”
Higher noise was defined as exceeding an average of 50 decibels during the day and 45 decibels between 11 pm and 7 am. Fifty decibels is generally considered to be the equivalent of a humming refrigerator.
The World Health Organization recommends limiting daytime aircraft noise to 45 decibels and nighttime noise to 40 decibels to avoid negative health effects. Compared to road or rail noise, planes tend to be louder and more unpredictable. So, according to the UCL researchers, it’s difficult to get used to them.

Past research has linked constant plane noise to sleep disturbances, increased stress, impaired cognition in children, weight gain and a higher risk of high blood pressure and heart disease. The UCL researchers attributed much of the changes in heart structure and function to obesity and high blood pressure (specifically for those exposed to daytime noise). Among the study participants, 8% lived in an area with high daytime noise and 3% with high nighttime noise. Moving away from the airport helped improve health.
Living near an airport can be hazardous to your health and safety. The risks increase with how close you live to the airport and how often you're exposed to aircraft noise and emissions.
Health risks are:

Air pollution: Aircraft emissions can expose you to high levels of ultrafine particles (UFPs) that can damage your lungs and breathing passages. UFPs can also worsen asthma symptoms and impair cognitive ability in children.
Noise pollution: The constant noise from aircraft taking off and landing can disrupt your sleep and quality of life.
Cardiovascular disease: Exposure to aircraft noise and emissions can increase your risk of heart disease and hypertension.
Respiratory issues: People with pre-existing conditions like asthma may experience more frequent and severe respiratory symptoms.
Mental health problems: The stress and sleep disturbances caused by aircraft noise can contribute to anxiety and depression.
Safety concerns are:
Traffic congestion: Airports can generate significant traffic congestion in the surrounding areas, which can lead to longer commute times.
Aircraft emergencies: In the event of an aircraft emergency, properties near the airport may be at a higher risk.

What’s the safe distance?

A study supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in collaboration with the University of California and Columbia University found that people who lived within six miles of 12 of California's largest airports exhibited higher levels of asthma and heart-related problems.
The ideal distance to live from an airport depends on your preferences and how much noise and pollution you're willing to tolerate.
Noise pollution
Distance from flight paths: Properties closer to flight paths will experience more noise.
Elevation: Properties at higher elevations may experience less noise.
Orientation: Properties with windows and outdoor spaces facing away from the airport may be quieter.
Air pollution
Ultrafine particles: Airport exhaust contains ultrafine particles that can be inhaled or swallowed and can worsen asthma symptoms.
Air quality: Heavy airplane traffic can pollute the air up to 10 miles away.

This was a slight improvement from the previous day's air quality index (AQI) of 236.
Of the three monitoring stations, two — Teri Gram and Vikas Sadan — recorded AQI levels in the poor category with readings of 272 and 203, respectively. However, the AQI in Sector 51 was slightly better, classified as ‘moderate', with a reading of 186. The AQI at Gwalpahari could not be recorded due to insufficient data.
Experts predicted that the AQI was likely to remain in the ‘poor' to ‘very poor' category over the next six days, primarily due to the unfavourable dispersion of pollutants.
According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), the ventilation index, which measures the atmosphere's ability to disperse pollutants, is lower than the required 6,000m²/s. The average wind speed, which is less than 10kmph, added to poor pollutant dispersion.
